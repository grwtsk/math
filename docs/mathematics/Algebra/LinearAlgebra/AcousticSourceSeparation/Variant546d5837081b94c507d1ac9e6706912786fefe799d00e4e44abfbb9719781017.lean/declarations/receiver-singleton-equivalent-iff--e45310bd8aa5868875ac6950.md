## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2705dfa5-3342-f21d-94fe-19e1bf8c0a7e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 98–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem receiver_singleton_equivalent_iff (test : Bool) (identity : String)
    (x y : SourceChannels) :
    (receiverNotion {test} identity).Equivalent 1 x y ↔
      receiverPolicy.observe test x = receiverPolicy.observe test y := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    exact h test (by simp [receiverNotion]) (by simp [receiverNotion, receiverPolicy])
  · intro h other member _
    have equal : other = test := by simpa [receiverNotion] using member
    subst other
    exact h

/-- The exact inventory union determines the first source trace. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/AcousticSourceSeparation/Variant546d5837081b94c507d1ac9e6706912786fefe799d00e4e44abfbb9719781017.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/AcousticSourceSeparation/Variant546d5837081b94c507d1ac9e6706912786fefe799d00e4e44abfbb9719781017.lean#L98).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `007139266dfb082d9fe9791e75c2dd4868366cce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
