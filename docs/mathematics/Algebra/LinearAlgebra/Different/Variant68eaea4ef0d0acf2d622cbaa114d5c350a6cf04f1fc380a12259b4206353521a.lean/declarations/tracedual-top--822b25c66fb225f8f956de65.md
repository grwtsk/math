## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3203c35f-fcc2-7c74-77e2-7eb49a1e48d7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 122–138.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma traceDual_top' :
    (⊤ : Submodule B L)ᵛ =
      if ((LinearMap.range (Algebra.trace K L)).restrictScalars A ≤ 1) then ⊤ else ⊥ := by
  split_ifs with h
  · rw [_root_.eq_top_iff]
    exact fun _ _ _ _ ↦ h ⟨_, rfl⟩
  · simp only [SetLike.le_def, restrictScalars_mem, LinearMap.mem_range, mem_one,
      forall_exists_index, forall_apply_eq_imp_iff, not_forall, not_exists] at h
    obtain ⟨b, hb⟩ := h
    simp_rw [eq_bot_iff, SetLike.le_def, mem_bot, mem_traceDual, mem_top, true_implies,
      traceForm_apply, RingHom.mem_range]
    contrapose! hb with hx'
    obtain ⟨c, hc, hc0⟩ := hx'
    simpa [hc0] using hc (c⁻¹ * b)

variable [IsDomain A] [IsFractionRing A K] [FiniteDimensional K L] [Algebra.IsSeparable K L]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Different/Variant68eaea4ef0d0acf2d622cbaa114d5c350a6cf04f1fc380a12259b4206353521a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Different/Variant68eaea4ef0d0acf2d622cbaa114d5c350a6cf04f1fc380a12259b4206353521a.lean#L122).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80aa2fd72bb8b22bf434ee45037d3305580fea98` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
