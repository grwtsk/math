## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ab9288fd5108b2856ef3e1bc3845293ed26670cefe9ecc4f254d4af3959feb11`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 657–666.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def Ideal.smithCoeffs (b : Basis ι R S) (I : Ideal S) (hI : I ≠ ⊥) : ι → R :=
  (Ideal.exists_smith_normal_form b I hI).choose_spec.choose
#align ideal.smith_coeffs Ideal.smithCoeffs

/-- If `S` a finite-dimensional ring extension of a PID `R` which is free as an `R`-module,
then any nonzero `S`-ideal `I` is free as an `R`-submodule of `S`, and we can
find a basis for `S` and `I` such that the inclusion map is a square diagonal
matrix.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PID/Variantcaa83aa08262de85e7ec613577b2deb6ddbd715c6b32dd89879a5c11e841c3c8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PID/Variantcaa83aa08262de85e7ec613577b2deb6ddbd715c6b32dd89879a5c11e841c3c8.lean#L657).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b5afef672f3b4238f35d3d69c040cb35f1afe227` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
