## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8f312945-147e-9bf0-a664-67ec8e506d27`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 70–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem continuous_of_linear_of_boundₛₗ {f : E → F} (h_add : ∀ x y, f (x + y) = f x + f y)
    (h_smul : ∀ (c : 𝕜) (x), f (c • x) = σ c • f x) {C : ℝ} (h_bound : ∀ x, ‖f x‖ ≤ C * ‖x‖) :
    Continuous f :=
  let φ : E →ₛₗ[σ] F :=
    { toFun := f
      map_add' := h_add
      map_smul' := h_smul }
  AddMonoidHomClass.continuous_of_bound φ C h_bound

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ContinuousLinearMap/Variant23257e999f5db1a268ee4860979457affd099973e46e0147ca9a346c472e9306.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ContinuousLinearMap/Variant23257e999f5db1a268ee4860979457affd099973e46e0147ca9a346c472e9306.lean#L70).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e72e4119f6869bf26e702d508c00a1ad384feccc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
