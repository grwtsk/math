## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2e781392-05cd-48f5-1418-e831bfc82fb4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 157–175.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem ContinuousLinearMap.isUniformEmbedding_of_bound {K : ℝ≥0} (hf : ∀ x, ‖x‖ ≤ K * ‖f x‖) :
    IsUniformEmbedding f :=
  (AddMonoidHomClass.antilipschitz_of_bound f hf).isUniformEmbedding f.uniformContinuous

variable [Ring 𝕜] [Ring 𝕜₂]
variable [SeminormedAddCommGroup E] [SeminormedAddCommGroup F]
variable [Module 𝕜 E] [Module 𝕜₂ F]
variable {σ : 𝕜 →+* 𝕜₂} (f : E →ₛₗ[σ] F)

/-- A (semi-)linear map which is a homothety is a continuous linear map.
    Since the field `𝕜` need not have `ℝ` as a subfield, this theorem is not directly deducible from
    the corresponding theorem about isometries plus a theorem about scalar multiplication.  Likewise
    for the other theorems about homotheties in this file.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ContinuousLinearMap/Variantd726ea4375ed1d569c36a836695f8cfe30e3297ceee0e61a6ce880566d7eea2e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ContinuousLinearMap/Variantd726ea4375ed1d569c36a836695f8cfe30e3297ceee0e61a6ce880566d7eea2e.lean#L157).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2df28154661ba42eeee398ddde212f03471a7e3d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
