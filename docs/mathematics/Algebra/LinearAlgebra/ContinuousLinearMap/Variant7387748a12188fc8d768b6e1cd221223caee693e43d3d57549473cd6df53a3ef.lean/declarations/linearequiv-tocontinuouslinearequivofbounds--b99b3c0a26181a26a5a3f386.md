## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:26714209b317ace3a5b0de1ba9cab9f92d833e11d4e12ba85981a6490dceb6ba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–142.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def LinearEquiv.toContinuousLinearEquivOfBounds (e : E ≃ₛₗ[σ] F) (C_to C_inv : ℝ)
    (h_to : ∀ x, ‖e x‖ ≤ C_to * ‖x‖) (h_inv : ∀ x : F, ‖e.symm x‖ ≤ C_inv * ‖x‖) : E ≃SL[σ] F where
  toLinearEquiv := e
  continuous_toFun := AddMonoidHomClass.continuous_of_bound e C_to h_to
  continuous_invFun := AddMonoidHomClass.continuous_of_bound e.symm C_inv h_inv

/-- Reinterpret a linear map `𝕜 →ₗ[𝕜] E` as a continuous linear map. This construction
is generalized to the case of any finite-dimensional domain
in `LinearMap.toContinuousLinearMap`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ContinuousLinearMap/Variant7387748a12188fc8d768b6e1cd221223caee693e43d3d57549473cd6df53a3ef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ContinuousLinearMap/Variant7387748a12188fc8d768b6e1cd221223caee693e43d3d57549473cd6df53a3ef.lean#L126).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5332a7b25cbac894f0e4e997de90b90e039ea166` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
