## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7ebeb2b89be4b6aa04908c9eb3d07f2b7a21981251544eafeddafa898cf23158`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–69.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance enoughProjectives [Small.{v} R] : EnoughProjectives (ModuleCat.{v} R) where
  presentation M :=
    let e : Basis M R (M →₀ Shrink.{v} R) := ⟨Finsupp.mapRange.linearEquiv (Shrink.linearEquiv R R)⟩
    ⟨{p := ModuleCat.of R (M →₀ Shrink.{v} R)
      projective := projective_of_free e
      f := ofHom <| e.constr ℕ _root_.id
      epi := by
        rw [epi_iff_range_eq_top, range_eq_top]
        refine fun m ↦ ⟨Finsupp.single m 1, ?_⟩
        simp [e, Basis.constr_apply] }⟩

end ModuleCat
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projective/Variant0f2aeb45e3c2d2411d93beb19142bade9e2fd99b1a45ff6c8357f39b124bc6ec.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projective/Variant0f2aeb45e3c2d2411d93beb19142bade9e2fd99b1a45ff6c8357f39b124bc6ec.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b75bc748bfa7aae9043af58b7479c8c977d90ae4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
