## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:133bf274db358fa44b3966b304a8624136134e19a28c6c794e4083a8475eaa88`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 216–238.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Projective.tensorProduct [hM : Module.Projective R M] [hN : Module.Projective R₀ N] :
    Module.Projective R (M ⊗[R₀] N) := by
  obtain ⟨sM, hsM⟩ := hM
  obtain ⟨sN, hsN⟩ := hN
  have : Module.Projective R (M ⊗[R₀] (N →₀ R₀)) := by
    fapply Projective.of_split (R := R) (M := ((M →₀ R) ⊗[R₀] (N →₀ R₀)))
    · exact (AlgebraTensorModule.map sM (LinearMap.id (R := R₀) (M := N →₀ R₀)))
    · exact (AlgebraTensorModule.map
        (Finsupp.linearCombination R id) (LinearMap.id (R := R₀) (M := N →₀ R₀)))
    · ext; simp [hsM _]
  fapply Projective.of_split (R := R) (M := (M ⊗[R₀] (N →₀ R₀)))
  · exact (AlgebraTensorModule.map (LinearMap.id (R := R) (M := M)) sN)
  · exact (AlgebraTensorModule.map (LinearMap.id (R := R) (M := M)) (linearCombination R₀ id))
  · ext; simp [hsN _]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projective/Variant63182b4ba55b34adf4231a2ecfea53f14b81bfe27077e0a4dc4b6a9a29d4f1e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projective/Variant63182b4ba55b34adf4231a2ecfea53f14b81bfe27077e0a4dc4b6a9a29d4f1e1.lean#L216).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c102a77be8ce2309987ba62ccf51a017c5e49961` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
