## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:62b44adf08e5eac6c9b59f74974d7e1c2a405bac8c3276a602e186996cd239b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–144.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [Projective R P] [Projective R Q] : Projective R (P × Q) := by
  refine .of_lifting_property'' fun f hf ↦ ?_
  rcases projective_lifting_property f (.inl _ _ _) hf with ⟨g₁, hg₁⟩
  rcases projective_lifting_property f (.inr _ _ _) hf with ⟨g₂, hg₂⟩
  refine ⟨coprod g₁ g₂, ?_⟩
  rw [LinearMap.comp_coprod, hg₁, hg₂, LinearMap.coprod_inl_inr]

variable {ι : Type*} (A : ι → Type*) [∀ i : ι, AddCommMonoid (A i)] [∀ i : ι, Module R (A i)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projective/Variant63182b4ba55b34adf4231a2ecfea53f14b81bfe27077e0a4dc4b6a9a29d4f1e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projective/Variant63182b4ba55b34adf4231a2ecfea53f14b81bfe27077e0a4dc4b6a9a29d4f1e1.lean#L136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c102a77be8ce2309987ba62ccf51a017c5e49961` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
