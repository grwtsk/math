## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:17ed9ed4-9f27-ec82-cffa-963531e68dc0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–251.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma restrict₂_apply (hIJ : I ⊆ J) (x : EuclideanSpace 𝕜 J) (i : I) :
    EuclideanSpace.restrict₂ hIJ x i = x ⟨i.1, hIJ i.2⟩ := rfl

end restrict₂

end EuclideanSpace

/-- A finite, mutually orthogonal family of subspaces of `E`, which span `E`, induce an isometry
from `E` to `PiLp 2` of the subspaces equipped with the `L2` inner product. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PiL2/Variant292a688ca824a70117d222b086a7a71bf43b9abfda8016245462dc3e47d94738.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PiL2/Variant292a688ca824a70117d222b086a7a71bf43b9abfda8016245462dc3e47d94738.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1053a8ff6500a09b1a90b04cb76759d379fbffa6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
