## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dc4a3fb3-b417-f1bb-1b56-b7a400e9be7e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 517–524.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem sum_inner_mul_inner (b : OrthonormalBasis ι 𝕜 E) (x y : E) :
    ∑ i, ⟪x, b i⟫ * ⟪b i, y⟫ = ⟪x, y⟫ := by
  have := congr_arg (innerSL 𝕜 x) (b.sum_repr y)
  rw [map_sum] at this
  convert! this
  rw [map_smul, b.repr_apply_apply, mul_comm]
  simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PiL2/Variant292a688ca824a70117d222b086a7a71bf43b9abfda8016245462dc3e47d94738.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PiL2/Variant292a688ca824a70117d222b086a7a71bf43b9abfda8016245462dc3e47d94738.lean#L517).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1053a8ff6500a09b1a90b04cb76759d379fbffa6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
