## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f5ff7a74-2be5-a00c-f07f-e9939519f8d1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 226–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem supported_comap_lmapDomain (f : α → α') (s : Set α') :
    supported M R (f ⁻¹' s) ≤ (supported M R s).comap (lmapDomain M R f) := by
  classical
  intro l (hl : (l.support : Set α) ⊆ f ⁻¹' s)
  change ↑(mapDomain f l).support ⊆ s
  rw [← Set.image_subset_iff, ← Finset.coe_image] at hl
  exact Set.Subset.trans mapDomain_support hl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Supported/Variant9735b7a29f98e467b5568d32c1679833e32ef4161b721cfb5bb05865b60e0b05.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Supported/Variant9735b7a29f98e467b5568d32c1679833e32ef4161b721cfb5bb05865b60e0b05.lean#L226).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `df6e7106801a6a1319ed50a2a89b30e15cc760f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
