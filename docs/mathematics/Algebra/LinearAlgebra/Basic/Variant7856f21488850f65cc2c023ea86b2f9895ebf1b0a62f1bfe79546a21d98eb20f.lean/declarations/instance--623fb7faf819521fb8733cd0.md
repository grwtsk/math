## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:445f087b8014af0775c9c4d8dcde2834e8f532abac77cdec1aaa7ab393b6eba2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 436–446.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {ι} [Finite ι] (R : ι → Type*) [Π i, Ring (R i)] [∀ i, IsSemisimpleRing (R i)] :
    IsSemisimpleRing (Π i, R i) := by
  let _ (i) : Module (Π i, R i) (R i) := Module.compHom _ (Pi.evalRingHom R i)
  let e (i) : R i →ₛₗ[Pi.evalRingHom R i] R i :=
    { AddMonoidHom.id (R i) with map_smul' := fun _ _ ↦ rfl }
  have (i : _) : IsSemisimpleModule (Π i, R i) (R i) :=
    ((e i).isSemisimpleModule_iff_of_bijective Function.bijective_id).mpr inferInstance

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant7856f21488850f65cc2c023ea86b2f9895ebf1b0a62f1bfe79546a21d98eb20f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant7856f21488850f65cc2c023ea86b2f9895ebf1b0a62f1bfe79546a21d98eb20f.lean#L436).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b483316a477e936721c4f002b7aa31d398ef4d07` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
