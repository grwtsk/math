## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d705fcc28acbfa9e69bdc3ca61156d82ec9fcc7b92b27673cbce8b89ba0f6546`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 309–316.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def lifts (x : ⨂[R] i, s i) : Set (FreeAddMonoid (R × Π i, s i)) :=
  {p | AddCon.toQuotient (c := addConGen (PiTensorProduct.Eqv R s)) p = x}

set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in
/-- An element `p` of `FreeAddMonoid (R × Π i, s i)` lifts an element `x` of `⨂[R] i, s i`
if and only if `x` is equal to the sum of `a • ⨂ₜ[R] i, m i` over all the entries
`(a, m)` of `p`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant767309347dba8e6aa8fb49e0ecdb34111539e06401957b9bc5ceede706eb6e35.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant767309347dba8e6aa8fb49e0ecdb34111539e06401957b9bc5ceede706eb6e35.lean#L309).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bebd5b164fd9e2a48d612507faf9d89c2f90b222` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
