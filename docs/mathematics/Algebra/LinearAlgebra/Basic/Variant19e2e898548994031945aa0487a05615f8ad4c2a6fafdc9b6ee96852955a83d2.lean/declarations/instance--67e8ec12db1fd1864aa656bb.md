## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bb6824b47ca53dc021dae8f5c36fc3a507589af79bbb717baa757b55a37996ae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 173–189.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 900) {A : Type*} [Semiring A] [Algebra R A] {S : Submonoid R} :
    Monoid (LocalizedModule S A) :=
  fast_instance%
  { __ := (inferInstance : One (LocalizedModule S A))
    mul := LocalizedModule.mul
    one_mul := by
      rintro ⟨a, s⟩
      with_unfolding_all exact mk_eq.mpr ⟨1, by simp only [one_mul, mul_one, one_smul]⟩
    mul_one := by
      rintro ⟨a, s⟩
      with_unfolding_all exact mk_eq.mpr ⟨1, by simp only [mul_one, one_smul, one_mul]⟩
    mul_assoc := by with_unfolding_all
      rintro ⟨a₁, s₁⟩ ⟨a₂, s₂⟩ ⟨a₃, s₃⟩
      apply mk_eq.mpr _
      use 1
      simp only [one_mul, smul_smul, ← mul_assoc, mul_right_comm] }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant19e2e898548994031945aa0487a05615f8ad4c2a6fafdc9b6ee96852955a83d2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant19e2e898548994031945aa0487a05615f8ad4c2a6fafdc9b6ee96852955a83d2.lean#L173).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `467646b2838e258a32c000b1011b7faccc28ea67` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
