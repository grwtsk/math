## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:81ea7e9d07d7cf2062b7fc28d2a79c376da8e64f694aec2d1215212ffee7fc17`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 500–507.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofMagma [Mul G] : G →ₙ* MonoidAlgebra k G where
  toFun a := single a 1
  map_mul' a b := by simp only [mul_def, mul_one, sum_single_index, single_eq_zero, mul_zero]
#align monoid_algebra.of_magma MonoidAlgebra.ofMagma
#align monoid_algebra.of_magma_apply MonoidAlgebra.ofMagma_apply

/-- The embedding of a unital magma into its magma algebra. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantae1f6adea6decadc90b6a6d10465b612b3fd241f9881235a15a42f277baa2c4c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantae1f6adea6decadc90b6a6d10465b612b3fd241f9881235a15a42f277baa2c4c.lean#L500).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `830345ad09252f2061e2457c2c26d77c91d4277d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
