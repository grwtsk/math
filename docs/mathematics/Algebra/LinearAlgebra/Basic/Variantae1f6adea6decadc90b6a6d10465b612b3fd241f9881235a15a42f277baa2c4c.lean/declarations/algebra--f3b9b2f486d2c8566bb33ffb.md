## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bc6f903052e514356d4c589c4fe5c78a233a42a18c02266b53e1ae493a8158c2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 795–809.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance algebra {A : Type*} [CommSemiring k] [Semiring A] [Algebra k A] [Monoid G] :
    Algebra k (MonoidAlgebra A G) :=
  { singleOneRingHom.comp (algebraMap k A) with
    -- Porting note: `ext` → `refine Finsupp.ext fun _ => ?_`
    smul_def' := fun r a => by
      refine Finsupp.ext fun _ => ?_
      -- Porting note: Newly required.
      rw [Finsupp.coe_smul]
      simp [single_one_mul_apply, Algebra.smul_def, Pi.smul_apply]
    commutes' := fun r f => by
      refine Finsupp.ext fun _ => ?_
      simp [single_one_mul_apply, mul_single_one_apply, Algebra.commutes] }

/-- `Finsupp.single 1` as an `AlgHom` -/
@[simps! apply]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantae1f6adea6decadc90b6a6d10465b612b3fd241f9881235a15a42f277baa2c4c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantae1f6adea6decadc90b6a6d10465b612b3fd241f9881235a15a42f277baa2c4c.lean#L795).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `830345ad09252f2061e2457c2c26d77c91d4277d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
