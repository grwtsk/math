## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:956b8c43-a8bb-5de0-7ffb-cc875fda937d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 598–617.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem moduleAux_apply (a : A) (b : B) (m : M) : moduleAux (a ⊗ₜ[R] b) m = a • b • m :=
  rfl

variable [SMulCommClass A B M]

/-- If `M` is a representation of two different `R`-algebras `A` and `B` whose actions commute,
then it is a representation the `R`-algebra `A ⊗[R] B`.

An important example arises from a semiring `S`; allowing `S` to act on itself via left and right
multiplication, the roles of `R`, `A`, `B`, `M` are played by `ℕ`, `S`, `Sᵐᵒᵖ`, `S`. This example
is important because a submodule of `S` as a `Module` over `S ⊗[ℕ] Sᵐᵒᵖ` is a two-sided ideal.

NB: This is not an instance because in the case `B = A` and `M = A ⊗[R] A` we would have a diamond
of `smul` actions. Furthermore, this would not be a mere definitional diamond but a true
mathematical diamond in which `A ⊗[R] A` had two distinct scalar actions on itself: one from its
multiplication, and one from this would-be instance. Arguably we could live with this but in any
case the real fix is to address the ambiguity in notation, probably along the lines outlined here:

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant95c370424cbcb74a373459fbacbb9be2f9a74a586692ea649018510e5a367946.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant95c370424cbcb74a373459fbacbb9be2f9a74a586692ea649018510e5a367946.lean#L598).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bf830b9c8d0364e7ab390a54692f968308e48059` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
