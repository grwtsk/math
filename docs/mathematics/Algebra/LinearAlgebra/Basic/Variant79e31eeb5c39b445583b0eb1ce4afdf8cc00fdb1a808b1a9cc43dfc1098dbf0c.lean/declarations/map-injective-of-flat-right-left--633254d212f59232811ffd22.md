## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1613b719-82a4-2c0f-ef68-102870288c03`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 613–622.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- If `M₁` and `N₂` are flat `R`-modules, `i₁ : M₁ →ₗ[R] N₁` and `i₂ : M₂ →ₗ[R] N₂` are injective
  linear maps, then the linear map `i : M ≅ M₁ ⊗[R] M₂ →ₗ[R] N₁ ⊗[R] N₂ ≅ N` induced by `i₁`
  and `i₂` is injective.
  See `IsTensorProduct.map_injective_of_flat` for different flatness conditions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant79e31eeb5c39b445583b0eb1ce4afdf8cc00fdb1a808b1a9cc43dfc1098dbf0c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant79e31eeb5c39b445583b0eb1ce4afdf8cc00fdb1a808b1a9cc43dfc1098dbf0c.lean#L613).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f17ec10cf8724970eb2b234501ecf13949b5dc63` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
