## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7286a23a19a706d4fa391a8d9b75b11643a4ce30930ebe34cf1a473f70555165`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 72–81.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev ι : M →ₗ[R] ExteriorAlgebra R M :=
  CliffordAlgebra.ι _

section exteriorPower

-- New variables `n` and `M`, to get the correct order of variables in the notation.
variable (n : ℕ) (M : Type u2) [AddCommGroup M] [Module R M]

/-- Definition of the `n`th exterior power of a `R`-module `N`. We introduce the notation
`⋀[R]^n M` for `exteriorPower R n M`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant03a5aa81e3d23f25093858fb71d8d6b6dd29a6e2e6973cefa7cae6b5a9bab428.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant03a5aa81e3d23f25093858fb71d8d6b6dd29a6e2e6973cefa7cae6b5a9bab428.lean#L72).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a1a3ff7041d6740ba1cfdfc2244f84d1be6dbe4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
