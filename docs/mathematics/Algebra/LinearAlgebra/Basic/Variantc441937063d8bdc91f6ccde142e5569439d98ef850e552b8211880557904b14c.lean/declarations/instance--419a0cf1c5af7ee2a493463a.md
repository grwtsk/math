## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:88cc0d84a29a081b906d8b3d3a6da2cb24a5b4ae907a605ebf2264e60cc01fa9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 352–362.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) instOfFaithfulSMul {R A : Type*}
    [CommSemiring R] [Semiring A] [Algebra R A] [NoZeroDivisors A] [FaithfulSMul R A] :
    NoZeroSMulDivisors R A :=
  ⟨fun hcx => (mul_eq_zero.mp ((Algebra.smul_def _ _).symm.trans hcx)).imp_left
    (map_eq_zero_iff (algebraMap R A) <| FaithfulSMul.algebraMap_injective R A).mp⟩

@[deprecated (since := "2025-01-31")]
alias of_algebraMap_injective := instOfFaithfulSMul

variable {R A : Type*} [CommRing R] [Ring A] [Algebra R A]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc441937063d8bdc91f6ccde142e5569439d98ef850e552b8211880557904b14c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc441937063d8bdc91f6ccde142e5569439d98ef850e552b8211880557904b14c.lean#L352).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `16e299bca327ba1e4eb5cedb20afb7ed7d78bcb5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
