## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f7ee295aca80571197617d2762ad8b4656e31188c1e5f1e67b303c354534f5fb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 135–145.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive rel : FreeTensorAlgebra R A → FreeTensorAlgebra R A → Prop
  | id  : ∀ {i : I}, rel (ι R <| lof R I A i 1) 1
  | prod : ∀ {i : I} {a₁ a₂ : A i},
      rel
        (tprod R (⨁ i, A i) 2 (fun | 0 => lof R I A i a₁ | 1 => lof R I A i a₂))
        (ι R <| lof R I A i (a₁ * a₂))

that are identified in the free product -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant362a1f5d2ca629d88fe0cf74b52e0cc61bc822d7ac194fc6f4956e5004b0c094.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant362a1f5d2ca629d88fe0cf74b52e0cc61bc822d7ac194fc6f4956e5004b0c094.lean#L135).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0fab2cb8c8c6f42d0ec5b40fff11fd2a255b69bf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
