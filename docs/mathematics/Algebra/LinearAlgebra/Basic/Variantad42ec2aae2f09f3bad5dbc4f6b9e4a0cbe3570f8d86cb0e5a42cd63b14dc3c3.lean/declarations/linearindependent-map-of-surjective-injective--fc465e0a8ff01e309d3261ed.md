## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3646c4f1-3eec-e087-1c2a-be99268ccec1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 405–412.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem LinearIndependent.map_of_surjective_injective {R' M' : Type*}
    [Semiring R'] [AddCommMonoid M'] [Module R' M'] (hv : LinearIndependent R v)
    (i : R → R') (j : M →+ M') (hi : Surjective i) (hj : ∀ m, j m = 0 → m = 0)
    (hc : ∀ (r : R) (m : M), j (r • m) = i r • j m) : LinearIndependent R' (j ∘ v) :=
  hv.map_of_surjective_injectiveₛ i _ hi ((injective_iff_map_eq_zero _).mpr hj) hc

/-- If `f` is an injective linear map, then the family `f ∘ v` is linearly independent
if and only if the family `v` is linearly independent. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantad42ec2aae2f09f3bad5dbc4f6b9e4a0cbe3570f8d86cb0e5a42cd63b14dc3c3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantad42ec2aae2f09f3bad5dbc4f6b9e4a0cbe3570f8d86cb0e5a42cd63b14dc3c3.lean#L405).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b64fe65ed1a80c8f20f325d1f111aead2b3acc5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
