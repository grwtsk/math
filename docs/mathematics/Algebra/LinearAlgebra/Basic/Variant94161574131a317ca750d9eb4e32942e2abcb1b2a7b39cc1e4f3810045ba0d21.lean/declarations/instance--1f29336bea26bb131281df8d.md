## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:acc4c5f968cd1743a7584d19d1db3f904649d228d110176900608646819df62f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 873–890.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {R M N : Type*} [CommSemiring R] [AddCommGroup M] [AddCommGroup N]
    [Module R M] [Module R N] [Module ℚ M] [Module ℚ N] : CompatibleSMul R ℚ M N where
  smul_tmul q m n := by
    suffices q.den • ((q • m) ⊗ₜ[R] n) = q.den • (m ⊗ₜ[R] (q • n)) from

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant94161574131a317ca750d9eb4e32942e2abcb1b2a7b39cc1e4f3810045ba0d21.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant94161574131a317ca750d9eb4e32942e2abcb1b2a7b39cc1e4f3810045ba0d21.lean#L873).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77259d7ee7507bbea94c2c31ed99bc2a02014fb2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
