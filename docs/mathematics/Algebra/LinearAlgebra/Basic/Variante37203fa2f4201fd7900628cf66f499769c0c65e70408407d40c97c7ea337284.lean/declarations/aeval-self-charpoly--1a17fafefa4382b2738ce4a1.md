## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7c659ac3-9f80-2f17-42f5-f40b396e7b07`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 210–232.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem aeval_self_charpoly (M : Matrix n n R) : aeval M M.charpoly = 0 := by
  -- We begin with the fact $χ_M(t) I = adjugate (t I - M) * (t I - M)$,
  -- as an identity in `Matrix n n R[X]`.
  have h : M.charpoly • (1 : Matrix n n R[X]) = adjugate (charmatrix M) * charmatrix M :=
    (adjugate_mul _).symm
  -- Using the algebra isomorphism `Matrix n n R[X] ≃ₐ[R] Polynomial (Matrix n n R)`,
  -- we have the same identity in `Polynomial (Matrix n n R)`.
  apply_fun matPolyEquiv at h
  simp only [map_mul, matPolyEquiv_charmatrix] at h
  -- Because the coefficient ring `Matrix n n R` is non-commutative,
  -- evaluation at `M` is not multiplicative.
  -- However, any polynomial which is a product of the form $N * (t I - M)$
  -- is sent to zero, because the evaluation function puts the polynomial variable
  -- to the right of any coefficients, so everything telescopes.
  apply_fun fun p => p.eval M at h
  rw [eval_mul_X_sub_C] at h
  -- Now $χ_M (t) I$, when thought of as a polynomial of matrices
  -- and evaluated at some `N` is exactly $χ_M (N)$.
  rw [matPolyEquiv_smul_one, eval_map] at h
  -- Thus we have $χ_M(M) = 0$, which is the desired result.
  exact h

end Matrix
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variante37203fa2f4201fd7900628cf66f499769c0c65e70408407d40c97c7ea337284.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variante37203fa2f4201fd7900628cf66f499769c0c65e70408407d40c97c7ea337284.lean#L210).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `76b609b58c5df1f9e6f04b48f42b50f85a435dc9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
