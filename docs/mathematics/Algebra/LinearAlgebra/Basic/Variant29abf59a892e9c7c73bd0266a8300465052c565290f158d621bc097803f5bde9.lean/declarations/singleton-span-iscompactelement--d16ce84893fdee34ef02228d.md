## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7a312fe0-f6e1-4119-88eb-62504dad90d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 324–332.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem singleton_span_isCompactElement (x : M) :
    CompleteLattice.IsCompactElement (span R {x} : Submodule R M) := by
  rw [CompleteLattice.isCompactElement_iff_le_of_directed_sSup_le]
  intro d hemp hdir hsup
  have : x ∈ (sSup d) := (SetLike.le_def.mp hsup) (mem_span_singleton_self x)
  obtain ⟨y, ⟨hyd, hxy⟩⟩ := (mem_sSup_of_directed hemp hdir).mp this
  exact ⟨y, ⟨hyd, by simpa only [span_le, singleton_subset_iff] ⟩⟩

/-- The span of a finite subset is compact in the lattice of submodules. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant29abf59a892e9c7c73bd0266a8300465052c565290f158d621bc097803f5bde9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant29abf59a892e9c7c73bd0266a8300465052c565290f158d621bc097803f5bde9.lean#L324).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5d128fb58c9f480cc3665978b0329ac22edfe3ad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
