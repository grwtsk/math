## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:36a64ee9-149f-2d8b-a0b8-de8f0f5faa2f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 504–508.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_iInf_of_ker_le {f : F} (hf : Surjective f) {ι} {p : ι → Submodule R M}
    (h : LinearMap.ker f ≤ ⨅ i, p i) : map f (⨅ i, p i) = ⨅ i, map f (p i) := by
  conv_rhs => rw [← map_comap_eq_of_surjective hf (⨅ _, _), comap_iInf]
  simp_rw [fun i ↦ comap_map_eq_self (le_iInf_iff.mp h i)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant29abf59a892e9c7c73bd0266a8300465052c565290f158d621bc097803f5bde9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant29abf59a892e9c7c73bd0266a8300465052c565290f158d621bc097803f5bde9.lean#L504).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5d128fb58c9f480cc3665978b0329ac22edfe3ad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
