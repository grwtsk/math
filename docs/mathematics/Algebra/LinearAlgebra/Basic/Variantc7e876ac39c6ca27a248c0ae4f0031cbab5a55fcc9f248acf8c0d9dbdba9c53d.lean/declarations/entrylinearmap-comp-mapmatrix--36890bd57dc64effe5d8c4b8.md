## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:030dc1e1-9929-998c-7b18-138e429e5796`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 451–463.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma entryLinearMap_comp_mapMatrix (f : α →ₗ[R] β) (i : m) (j : n) :
    entryLinearMap R _ i j ∘ₗ f.mapMatrix = f ∘ₗ entryLinearMap R _ i j := rfl

end LinearMap

namespace LinearEquiv

variable [Semiring R] [AddCommMonoid α] [AddCommMonoid β] [AddCommMonoid γ]
variable [Module R α] [Module R β] [Module R γ]

/-- The `LinearEquiv` between spaces of matrices induced by a `LinearEquiv` between their
coefficients. This is `Matrix.map` as a `LinearEquiv`. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc7e876ac39c6ca27a248c0ae4f0031cbab5a55fcc9f248acf8c0d9dbdba9c53d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc7e876ac39c6ca27a248c0ae4f0031cbab5a55fcc9f248acf8c0d9dbdba9c53d.lean#L451).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e71002f0d5fbcb179719f239c1a747c64879caf4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
