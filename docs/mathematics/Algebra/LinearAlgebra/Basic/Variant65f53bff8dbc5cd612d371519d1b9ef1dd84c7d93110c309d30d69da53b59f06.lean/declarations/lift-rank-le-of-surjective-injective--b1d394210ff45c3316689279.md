## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d13b0f59-7b40-efb8-df8c-4a320b439a9f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 139–151.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lift_rank_le_of_surjective_injective (i : R → R') (j : M →+ M')
    (hi : Surjective i) (hj : Injective j) (hc : ∀ (r : R) (m : M), j (r • m) = i r • j m) :
    lift.{v'} (Module.rank R M) ≤ lift.{v} (Module.rank R' M') := by
  obtain ⟨i', hi'⟩ := hi.hasRightInverse
  refine lift_rank_le_of_injective_injectiveₛ i' j (fun _ _ h ↦ ?_) hj fun r m ↦ ?_
  · apply_fun i at h
    rwa [hi', hi'] at h
  rw [hc (i' r) m, hi']

/-- If `M / R` and `M' / R'` are modules, `i : R → R'` is a bijective map which maps zero to zero,
`j : M ≃+ M'` is a group isomorphism, such that the scalar multiplications on `M` and `M'` are
compatible, then the rank of `M / R` is equal to the rank of `M' / R'`.
As a special case, taking `R = R'` it is `LinearEquiv.lift_rank_eq`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant65f53bff8dbc5cd612d371519d1b9ef1dd84c7d93110c309d30d69da53b59f06.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant65f53bff8dbc5cd612d371519d1b9ef1dd84c7d93110c309d30d69da53b59f06.lean#L139).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `513347a9801998659f8f17c4f575144d128f82c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
