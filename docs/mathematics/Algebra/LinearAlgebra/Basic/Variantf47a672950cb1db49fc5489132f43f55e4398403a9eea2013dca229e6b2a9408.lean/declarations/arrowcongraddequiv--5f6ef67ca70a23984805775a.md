## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3293c7f0536c7b9b2c18595e0cbaedf13eefbfbfb1c1ee15251053e9a1f95d4a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 509–524.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simps] def arrowCongrAddEquiv (e₁ : M₁ ≃ₗ[R] M₂) (e₂ : M₂₁ ≃ₗ[R] M₂₂) :
    (M₁ →ₗ[R] M₂₁) ≃+ (M₂ →ₗ[R] M₂₂) where
  toFun f := e₂.comp (f.comp e₁.symm.toLinearMap)
  invFun f := e₂.symm.comp (f.comp e₁.toLinearMap)
  left_inv f := by
    ext x
    simp only [symm_apply_apply, Function.comp_apply, coe_comp, coe_coe]
  right_inv f := by
    ext x
    simp only [Function.comp_apply, apply_symm_apply, coe_comp, coe_coe]
  map_add' f g := by
    ext x
    simp only [map_add, add_apply, Function.comp_apply, coe_comp, coe_coe]

/-- A linear isomorphism between the domains an codomains of two spaces of linear maps gives a
linear isomorphism with respect to an action on the domains. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantf47a672950cb1db49fc5489132f43f55e4398403a9eea2013dca229e6b2a9408.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantf47a672950cb1db49fc5489132f43f55e4398403a9eea2013dca229e6b2a9408.lean#L509).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1b1a32462501b2a2ccd75ec9f533be8a26fdfe41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
