## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:77d91900-9128-d016-563d-54e75a438688`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 214–223.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem adjoin_image (f : A →ₐ[R] B) (s : Set A) : adjoin R (f '' s) = (adjoin R s).map f :=
  le_antisymm (adjoin_le <| Set.image_subset _ subset_adjoin) <|
    Subalgebra.map_le.2 <| adjoin_le <| Set.image_subset_iff.1 <| by
      -- porting note: I don't understand how this worked in Lean 3 with just `subset_adjoin`
      simp only [Set.image_id', coe_carrier_toSubmonoid, Subalgebra.coe_toSubsemiring,
        Subalgebra.coe_comap]
      exact fun x hx => subset_adjoin ⟨x, hx, rfl⟩
#align algebra.adjoin_image Algebra.adjoin_image

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc655dcca2dab80cc3f1a953aca3d8916e91d2df84574106be799b5394ab5810e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc655dcca2dab80cc3f1a953aca3d8916e91d2df84574106be799b5394ab5810e.lean#L214).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7c8fc3e12a810bf72411f6558cbfbd72c99d13c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
