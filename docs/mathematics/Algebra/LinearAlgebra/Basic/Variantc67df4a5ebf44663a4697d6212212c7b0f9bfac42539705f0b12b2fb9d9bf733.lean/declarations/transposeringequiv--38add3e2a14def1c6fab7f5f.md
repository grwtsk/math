## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2e2457ef89a3022b5d266550bb2714de678256288c6f5789980c055ee2ca5083`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2095–2108.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def transposeRingEquiv [AddCommMonoid α] [CommSemigroup α] [Fintype m] :
    Matrix m m α ≃+* (Matrix m m α)ᵐᵒᵖ :=
  { (transposeAddEquiv m m α).trans MulOpposite.opAddEquiv with
    toFun := fun M => MulOpposite.op Mᵀ
    invFun := fun M => M.unopᵀ
    map_mul' := fun M N =>
      (congr_arg MulOpposite.op (transpose_mul M N)).trans (MulOpposite.op_mul _ _)
    left_inv := fun M => transpose_transpose M
    right_inv := fun M => MulOpposite.unop_injective <| transpose_transpose M.unop }
#align matrix.transpose_ring_equiv Matrix.transposeRingEquiv

variable {m α}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc67df4a5ebf44663a4697d6212212c7b0f9bfac42539705f0b12b2fb9d9bf733.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc67df4a5ebf44663a4697d6212212c7b0f9bfac42539705f0b12b2fb9d9bf733.lean#L2095).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `489c189806ace4c402c1fdd0333f53e4c5d0c139` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
