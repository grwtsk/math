## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f2726524-9498-5211-4b00-13f91c47d201`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 929–953.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

Assemble an algebra morphism `TrivSqZeroExt R M →ₐ[S] A` from separate morphisms on `R` and `M`.

Namely, we require that for an algebra morphism `f : R →ₐ[S] A` and a linear map `g : M →ₗ[S] A`,
we have:

* `g x * g y = 0`: the elements of `M` continue to square to zero.
* `g (r •> x) = f r * g x` and `g (x <• r) = g x * f r`: scalar multiplication on the left and
  right is sent to left- and right- multiplication by the image under `f`.

See `TrivSqZeroExt.liftEquiv` for this as an equiv; namely that any such algebra morphism can be
factored in this way.

When `R` is commutative, this can be invoked with `f = Algebra.ofId R A`, which satisfies `hfg` and
`hgf`. This version is captured as an equiv by `TrivSqZeroExt.liftEquivOfComm`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant1c56966449f3f0925d313dd5c3970a61234b19ea4936eab8502ff3bc99bddcb5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant1c56966449f3f0925d313dd5c3970a61234b19ea4936eab8502ff3bc99bddcb5.lean#L929).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b5dd863ad3b4b556472a3901a746fab5290d4bb8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
