## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6da9e1485c5edc8bc83d960740ac8d3ad87c4ab0f6b64e3d35a4187a5eb4cae3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 836–844.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def alternatization : MultilinearMap R (fun _ : ι => M) N' →+ M [⋀^ι]→ₗ[R] N' where
  toFun m :=
    { ∑ σ : Perm ι, Equiv.Perm.sign σ • m.domDomCongr σ with
      toFun := ⇑(∑ σ : Perm ι, Equiv.Perm.sign σ • m.domDomCongr σ)
      map_eq_zero_of_eq' := private fun v i j hvij hij =>
        alternization_map_eq_zero_of_eq_aux m v i j hij hvij }
  map_add' a b := by ext; simp [Finset.sum_add_distrib]
  map_zero' := by ext; simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantf217f88f63ad8b916e2e0c7df16949e6b00e04b20a1e57e29927be5a1022683c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantf217f88f63ad8b916e2e0c7df16949e6b00e04b20a1e57e29927be5a1022683c.lean#L836).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a27cfc439d7cd3c3f4b15baf3373869bf960468c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
