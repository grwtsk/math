## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4cb3f2670747e8482c40f9c1f1957a0f4768017687077613ba4839a562354ce0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1132–1148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : IsLocalizedModule S₂ (liftOfLE S₁ S₂ h f₁ f₂) where
  map_units := map_units f₂
  surj' y := by
    obtain ⟨⟨y', s⟩, e⟩ := IsLocalizedModule.surj S₂ f₂ y
    exact ⟨⟨f₁ y', s⟩, by simpa⟩
  exists_of_eq := by
    intros x₁ x₂ e
    obtain ⟨x₁, s₁, rfl⟩ := mk'_surjective S₁ f₁ x₁
    obtain ⟨x₂, s₂, rfl⟩ := mk'_surjective S₁ f₁ x₂
    simp only [Function.uncurry, liftOfLE_mk', mk'_eq_mk'_iff, Submonoid.mk_smul,
      Submonoid.smul_def, ← mk'_smul] at e ⊢
    obtain ⟨c, e⟩ := e
    exact ⟨c, 1, by simpa [← smul_comm c.1]⟩

end liftOfLE

include S in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant0f1f0b5427fc895d2c998d7dea08d3635edafc96e8055a35111e0df2469561d6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant0f1f0b5427fc895d2c998d7dea08d3635edafc96e8055a35111e0df2469561d6.lean#L1132).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9645b989a209b907145a8aaefc766e42ac419797` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
