## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f058c64aa9f546d4f12deb651bf6fe2e744344a97af12275db888f53af22b48d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 820–824.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def rTensorHomToHomRTensor : (M →ₗ[R] P) ⊗[R] Q →ₗ[R] M →ₗ[R] P ⊗[R] Q :=
  TensorProduct.lift (llcomp R M P _ ∘ₗ (mk R P Q).flip).flip

/-- The linear map from `(M →ₗ P) ⊗ (N →ₗ Q)` to `(M ⊗ N →ₗ P ⊗ Q)` sending `f ⊗ₜ g` to
the `TensorProduct.map f g`, the tensor product of the two maps. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variante852c9c92f74be6024928f28538b2bf659ec48392075a434beebaab80cdfe944.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variante852c9c92f74be6024928f28538b2bf659ec48392075a434beebaab80cdfe944.lean#L820).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c786d93b4b8cd0749f4b0d3a41c52c1464a6c6c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
