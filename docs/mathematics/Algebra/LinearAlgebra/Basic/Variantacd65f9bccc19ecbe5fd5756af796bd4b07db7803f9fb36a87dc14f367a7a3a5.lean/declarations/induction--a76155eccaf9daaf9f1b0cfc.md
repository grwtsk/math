## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ae0f70f8-4fc2-074d-e205-d044047a3a2e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–142.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem induction {C : ExteriorAlgebra R M → Prop}
    (algebraMap : ∀ r, C (algebraMap R (ExteriorAlgebra R M) r)) (ι : ∀ x, C (ι R x))
    (mul : ∀ a b, C a → C b → C (a * b)) (add : ∀ a b, C a → C b → C (a + b))
    (a : ExteriorAlgebra R M) : C a :=
  CliffordAlgebra.induction algebraMap ι mul add a

/-- The left-inverse of `algebraMap`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantacd65f9bccc19ecbe5fd5756af796bd4b07db7803f9fb36a87dc14f367a7a3a5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantacd65f9bccc19ecbe5fd5756af796bd4b07db7803f9fb36a87dc14f367a7a3a5.lean#L136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b7811de23e368269d332cd5864c603b50a2bffd7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
