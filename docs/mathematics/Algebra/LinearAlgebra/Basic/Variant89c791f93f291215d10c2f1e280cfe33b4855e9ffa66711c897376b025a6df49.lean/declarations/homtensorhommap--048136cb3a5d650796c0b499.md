## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fd203f6900c90439ba91b7245d9e56950b42780ba64a5078ba9242fb834254b9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 817–830.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def homTensorHomMap : (M →ₗ[R] P) ⊗[R] (N →ₗ[R] Q) →ₗ[R] M ⊗[R] N →ₗ[R] P ⊗[R] Q :=
  lift (mapBilinear R M N P Q)

variable {R M N P Q}

/--
This is a binary version of `TensorProduct.map`: Given a bilinear map `f : M ⟶ P ⟶ Q` and a
bilinear map `g : N ⟶ S ⟶ T`, if we think `f` and `g` as linear maps with two inputs, then
`map₂ f g` is a bilinear map taking two inputs `M ⊗ N → P ⊗ S → Q ⊗ S` defined by
`map₂ f g (m ⊗ n) (p ⊗ s) = f m p ⊗ g n s`.

Mathematically, `TensorProduct.map₂` is defined as the composition
`M ⊗ N -map→ Hom(P, Q) ⊗ Hom(S, T) -homTensorHomMap→ Hom(P ⊗ S, Q ⊗ T)`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant89c791f93f291215d10c2f1e280cfe33b4855e9ffa66711c897376b025a6df49.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant89c791f93f291215d10c2f1e280cfe33b4855e9ffa66711c897376b025a6df49.lean#L817).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `85081c27579d700be9047c196d3a8fa6a81a28a7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
