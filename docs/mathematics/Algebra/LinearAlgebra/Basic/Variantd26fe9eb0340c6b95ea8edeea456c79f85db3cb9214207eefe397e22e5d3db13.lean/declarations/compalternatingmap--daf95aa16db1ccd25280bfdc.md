## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ab4feba9ca0a52365964272bacc134ea66bd780c4a72bcd9406295c64885debb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 465–472.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def compAlternatingMapₗ [Semiring S] [Module S N] [Module S N₂]
    [SMulCommClass R S N] [SMulCommClass R S N₂] [LinearMap.CompatibleSMul N N₂ S R]
    (g : N →ₗ[R] N₂) :
    (M [⋀^ι]→ₗ[R] N) →ₗ[S] (M [⋀^ι]→ₗ[R] N₂) where
  toFun := g.compAlternatingMap
  map_add' := g.compAlternatingMap_add
  map_smul' := g.compAlternatingMap_smul

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantd26fe9eb0340c6b95ea8edeea456c79f85db3cb9214207eefe397e22e5d3db13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantd26fe9eb0340c6b95ea8edeea456c79f85db3cb9214207eefe397e22e5d3db13.lean#L465).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `944fa4bbe73214fe669516ed3abc5f26cc2eaf62` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
