## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3aeb0b64-545c-e36a-760b-05ae3ddaf350`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 462–476.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coe_mk'_linearMap (D : A →ₗ[R] M) (h) : (mk' D h : A →ₗ[R] M) = D :=
  rfl

end Cancel

section

variable {R : Type*} [CommRing R]
variable {A : Type*} [CommRing A] [Algebra R A]

section

variable {M : Type*} [AddCommGroup M] [Module A M] [Module R M]
variable (D : Derivation R A M) {D1 D2 : Derivation R A M} (a b : A)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant3898e6486c6997547c681b0d06ae4f6244e754e02e3f735533e78491965aec0d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant3898e6486c6997547c681b0d06ae4f6244e754e02e3f735533e78491965aec0d.lean#L462).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c7dfda9beef09c47b4c050f5d6a5466fcbd3cea9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
