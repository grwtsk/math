## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b6bcb9f8-3aaa-2b63-e17c-6e4461ded603`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 221–232.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    associatedPrimes R (R ⧸ I) = {I.radical} := by
  ext J

  refine ⟨IsAssociatedPrime.eq_radical hI, ?_⟩
  rintro rfl
  haveI : Nontrivial (R ⧸ I) := by
    refine ⟨(Ideal.Quotient.mk I :) 1, (Ideal.Quotient.mk I :) 0, ?_⟩
    rw [Ne, Ideal.Quotient.eq, sub_zero, ← Ideal.eq_top_iff_one]
    exact hI.1
  obtain ⟨a, ha⟩ := associatedPrimes.nonempty R (R ⧸ I)
  exact ha.eq_radical hI ▸ ha
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant7a1bc0923768a5aecd3b82337c72d8dd9d8849c91c25c3655160738557511662.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant7a1bc0923768a5aecd3b82337c72d8dd9d8849c91c25c3655160738557511662.lean#L221).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `652422749b11d56199447ed8205413199b72554c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
