## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0c2ce493ce9e9bb91ca2305fa5cf10794e53dec150671308fe111953cf578f15`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 409–414.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {ι} [Finite ι] (M : ι → Type*) [∀ i, AddCommGroup (M i)] [∀ i, Module R (M i)]
    [∀ i, IsSemisimpleModule R (M i)] : IsSemisimpleModule R (Π i, M i) := by
  classical
  exact isSemisimpleModule_of_isSemisimpleModule_submodule' (p := (range <| single _ _ ·))
    (fun i ↦ .range _) (by simp_rw [range_eq_map, Submodule.iSup_map_single, Submodule.pi_top])

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantdb9cfacdaea92fc121e23d23224fd7affbc0d60a81b9fff6127439a89c1b7762.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantdb9cfacdaea92fc121e23d23224fd7affbc0d60a81b9fff6127439a89c1b7762.lean#L409).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a66ac3b32ed3beddbf54fc818e5d1f64f8598f88` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
