## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:eaf6a7e03eece54ebca3f428d1143f1c13fc2ba2119bfa75d9bb627e0a4aed5a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 524–542.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def smulRightₗ : (M₂ →ₗ[R] R) →ₗ[R] M →ₗ[R] M₂ →ₗ[R] M
    where
  toFun f :=
    { toFun := LinearMap.smulRight f
      map_add' := fun m m' => by
        ext
        apply smul_add
      map_smul' := fun c m => by
        ext
        apply smul_comm }
  map_add' f f' := by
    ext
    apply add_smul
  map_smul' c f := by
    ext
    apply mul_smul
#align linear_map.smul_rightₗ LinearMap.smulRightₗ

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant62124a8ebcd3e8cd923c6fcab2056963f1f50090a1197cc84e0335d62669842b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant62124a8ebcd3e8cd923c6fcab2056963f1f50090a1197cc84e0335d62669842b.lean#L524).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `764287ee17194368be598ea217b39ecdaf26d603` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
