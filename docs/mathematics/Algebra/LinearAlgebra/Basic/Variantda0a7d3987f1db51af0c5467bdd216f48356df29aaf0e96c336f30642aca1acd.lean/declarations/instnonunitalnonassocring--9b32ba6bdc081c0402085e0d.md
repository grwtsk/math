## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a6444861ec91172b3e8b7338c0a96eb08408429ef1c5d9024adf3e320fef8e44`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 395–405.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instNonUnitalNonAssocRing : NonUnitalNonAssocRing (A ⊗[R] B) where
  toAddCommGroup := TensorProduct.addCommGroup
  __ := instNonUnitalNonAssocSemiring

end NonUnitalNonAssocRing

section NonAssocRing
variable [CommSemiring R]
variable [NonAssocRing A] [Module R A] [SMulCommClass R A A] [IsScalarTower R A A]
variable [NonAssocSemiring B] [Module R B] [SMulCommClass R B B] [IsScalarTower R B B]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantda0a7d3987f1db51af0c5467bdd216f48356df29aaf0e96c336f30642aca1acd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantda0a7d3987f1db51af0c5467bdd216f48356df29aaf0e96c336f30642aca1acd.lean#L395).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4e549ef97a68a9bb720c7f22873d34d5e29f310c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
