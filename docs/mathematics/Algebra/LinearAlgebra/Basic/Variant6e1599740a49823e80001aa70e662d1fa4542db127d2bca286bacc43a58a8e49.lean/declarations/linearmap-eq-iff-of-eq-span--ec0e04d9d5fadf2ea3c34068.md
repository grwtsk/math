## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:559cb1ba-10dd-34ff-25a3-5cb12eac3b87`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 103–125.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    | mem x hx => exact h ⟨x, hx⟩
    | zero => erw [map_zero, map_zero]
    | add x y hx hy hx' hy' =>
        erw [f.map_add ⟨x, hx⟩ ⟨y, hy⟩, g.map_add ⟨x, hx⟩ ⟨y, hy⟩]
        rw [hx', hy']
    | smul a x hx hx' =>
        erw [f.map_smul a ⟨x, hx⟩, g.map_smul a ⟨x, hx⟩]
        rw [hx']

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant6e1599740a49823e80001aa70e662d1fa4542db127d2bca286bacc43a58a8e49.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant6e1599740a49823e80001aa70e662d1fa4542db127d2bca286bacc43a58a8e49.lean#L103).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `03e4f85c41d42148ebf34bc68da14a0414b5ee92` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
