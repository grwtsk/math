## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5246110368226f0aef8360deb1cd3e7a3273422c62d375b185816a2c4822df34`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 825–839.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [Invertible (2 : R)] : Invertible (2 : Module.End R M) where
  invOf := (⟨⅟2, Set.invOf_mem_center (Set.ofNat_mem_center _ _)⟩ : Submonoid.center R) •
    (1 : Module.End R M)
  invOf_mul_self := by
    ext m
    dsimp [Submonoid.smul_def]
    rw [← ofNat_smul_eq_nsmul R, invOf_smul_smul (2 : R) m]
  mul_invOf_self := by
    ext m
    dsimp [Submonoid.smul_def]
    rw [← ofNat_smul_eq_nsmul R, smul_invOf_smul (2 : R) m]

/-- If `2` is invertible in `R`, then applying the inverse of `2` in `End R M` to an element
of `M` is the same as multiplying by the inverse of `2` in `R`. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant22ba6cb8b9a88a3c470878e283e6d0cac24a8dfba48ab4db2d65d6bcc75d9920.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant22ba6cb8b9a88a3c470878e283e6d0cac24a8dfba48ab4db2d65d6bcc75d9920.lean#L825).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ba86ff2cf97a7e31b5f653aef111f34d53964b9b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
