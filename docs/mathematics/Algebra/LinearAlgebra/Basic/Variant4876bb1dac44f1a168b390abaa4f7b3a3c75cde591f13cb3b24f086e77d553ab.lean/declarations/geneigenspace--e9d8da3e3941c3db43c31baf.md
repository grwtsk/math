## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:934188007dd8bf249ffec9925b2cea74845fb6f9c0b094defa75e1eb8c00dc12`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 77–80.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def genEigenspace (f : End R M) (μ : R) : ℕ∞ →o Submodule R M where
  toFun k := ⨆ l : ℕ, ⨆ _ : l ≤ k, LinearMap.ker ((f - μ • 1) ^ l)
  monotone' _ _ hkl := biSup_mono fun _ hi ↦ hi.trans hkl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant4876bb1dac44f1a168b390abaa4f7b3a3c75cde591f13cb3b24f086e77d553ab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant4876bb1dac44f1a168b390abaa4f7b3a3c75cde591f13cb3b24f086e77d553ab.lean#L77).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `345fd14c60c8088ebd04ed9ff642e3efc85f1d4b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
