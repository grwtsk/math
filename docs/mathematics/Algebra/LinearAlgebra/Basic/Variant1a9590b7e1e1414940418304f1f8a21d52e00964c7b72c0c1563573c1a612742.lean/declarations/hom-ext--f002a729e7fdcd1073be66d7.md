## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2698e0de-f80f-e0ff-0de6-b27e0ff0da46`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 173–182.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hom_ext {A : Type*} [Semiring A] [Algebra R A] {f g : TensorAlgebra R M →ₐ[R] A}
    (w : f.toLinearMap.comp (ι R) = g.toLinearMap.comp (ι R)) : f = g := by
  rw [← lift_symm_apply, ← lift_symm_apply] at w
  exact (lift R).symm.injective w

-- This proof closely follows `FreeAlgebra.induction`
/-- If `C` holds for the `algebraMap` of `r : R` into `TensorAlgebra R M`, the `ι` of `x : M`,
and is preserved under addition and multiplication, then it holds for all of `TensorAlgebra R M`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant1a9590b7e1e1414940418304f1f8a21d52e00964c7b72c0c1563573c1a612742.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant1a9590b7e1e1414940418304f1f8a21d52e00964c7b72c0c1563573c1a612742.lean#L173).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4d76a09009773293cb85824057e168655f0606be` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
