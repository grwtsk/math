## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4133f17d-5eac-cd84-a9d4-77a65339642d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 426–433.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasBasis_iInf_of_directed {ι : Type*} {ι' : Sort _} [Nonempty ι] {l : ι → Filter α}
    (s : ι → ι' → Set α) (p : ι → ι' → Prop) (hl : ∀ i, (l i).HasBasis (p i) (s i))
    (h : Directed (· ≥ ·) l) :
    (⨅ i, l i).HasBasis (fun ii' : ι × ι' => p ii'.1 ii'.2) fun ii' => s ii'.1 ii'.2 := by
  refine ⟨fun t => ?_⟩
  rw [mem_iInf_of_directed h, Prod.exists]
  exact exists_congr fun i => (hl i).mem_iff

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant1b22776af673907ca64a86e798785d68141a8c6a95aeb216feea945e319c29c5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant1b22776af673907ca64a86e798785d68141a8c6a95aeb216feea945e319c29c5.lean#L426).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4ac10f86172ad8ae566a79636ae993598efb394e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
