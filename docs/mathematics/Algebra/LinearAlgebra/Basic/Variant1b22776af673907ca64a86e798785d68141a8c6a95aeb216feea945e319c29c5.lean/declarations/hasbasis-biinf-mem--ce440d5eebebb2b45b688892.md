## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7567c088-8c74-c91e-a5a8-1cbf8f404850`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 621–627.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem HasBasis.biInf_mem [CompleteLattice β] {f : Set α → β} (h : HasBasis l p s)
    (hf : Monotone f) : ⨅ t ∈ l, f t = ⨅ (i) (_ : p i), f (s i) :=
  le_antisymm (le_iInf₂ fun i hi => iInf₂_le (s i) (h.mem_of_mem hi)) <|
    le_iInf₂ fun _t ht =>
      let ⟨i, hpi, hi⟩ := h.mem_iff.1 ht
      iInf₂_le_of_le i hpi (hf hi)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant1b22776af673907ca64a86e798785d68141a8c6a95aeb216feea945e319c29c5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant1b22776af673907ca64a86e798785d68141a8c6a95aeb216feea945e319c29c5.lean#L621).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4ac10f86172ad8ae566a79636ae993598efb394e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
