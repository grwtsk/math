## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:93af2924-00bd-6bc7-e8ca-2fa8040e3f14`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1147–1168.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

variable [CommSemiring R] [CommSemiring S] [Algebra R S]
variable [Semiring A] [Algebra R A] [Algebra S A] [IsScalarTower R S A]
variable [Semiring B] [Algebra R B]
variable [CommSemiring C] [Algebra R C] [Algebra S C] [IsScalarTower R S C]

/-- If `A`, `B`, `C` are `R`-algebras, `A` and `C` are also `S`-algebras (forming a tower as
`·/S/R`), then the product map of `f : A →ₐ[S] C` and `g : B →ₐ[R] C` is an `S`-algebra
homomorphism.

This is just a special case of `Algebra.TensorProduct.lift` for when `C` is commutative. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant2029a3e0632a4d68772ef25c80645d88e3ff421d32f107ae091465aea39e3543.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant2029a3e0632a4d68772ef25c80645d88e3ff421d32f107ae091465aea39e3543.lean#L1147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bd390c3bea6736863f8e77b39643fd624b6208ad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
