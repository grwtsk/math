## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5f9ab1ad2ec80c618133f710935a710edd0e23656557fb4d3983976cacc36f04`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 50–61.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure Coalgebra.Repr (R : Type u) {A : Type v}
    [CommSemiring R] [AddCommMonoid A] [Module R A] [CoalgebraStruct R A] (a : A) (ι : Type*) where
  /-- the finite indexing set of a representation of `comul a` -/
  (index : Finset ι)
  /-- the first coordinate of a representation of `comul a` -/
  (left : ι → A)
  /-- the second coordinate of a representation of `comul a` -/
  (right : ι → A)
  /-- `comul a` is equal to a finite sum of some pure tensors -/
  (eq : ∑ i ∈ index, left i ⊗ₜ[R] right i = CoalgebraStruct.comul a)

/-- An arbitrarily chosen representation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variante6bb06a7731bb0a853f93ca79a108a0f88c1f9d7e50e8136b6937d05d2da7d94.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variante6bb06a7731bb0a853f93ca79a108a0f88c1f9d7e50e8136b6937d05d2da7d94.lean#L50).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7abb2ed7b2accf77634e93f84ae81e4522fea368` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
