## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0152a481-ec25-9f37-4804-de5859faf5d2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 519–532.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma IsUnit.algebraMap_of_algebraMap (f : A →ₗ[R] B) (hf : f 1 = 1) {r : R}
    (h : IsUnit (algebraMap R A r)) : IsUnit (algebraMap R B r) :=
  let ⟨i⟩ := nonempty_invertible h
  letI := Invertible.algebraMapOfInvertibleAlgebraMap f hf i
  isUnit_of_invertible _

end invertibility

section algebraMap

variable {F E : Type*} [CommSemiring F] [Semiring E] [Algebra F E] (b : F →ₗ[F] E)

/-- If `E` is an `F`-algebra, and there exists an injective `F`-linear map from `F` to `E`,
then the algebra map from `F` to `E` is also injective. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant47a3ed1f5f74e9eec976f883c79f420332a47ab067dea360ae2a1e64279e3feb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant47a3ed1f5f74e9eec976f883c79f420332a47ab067dea360ae2a1e64279e3feb.lean#L519).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c99fbf6d09c94f85f896912c5e32a225e8dbc640` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
