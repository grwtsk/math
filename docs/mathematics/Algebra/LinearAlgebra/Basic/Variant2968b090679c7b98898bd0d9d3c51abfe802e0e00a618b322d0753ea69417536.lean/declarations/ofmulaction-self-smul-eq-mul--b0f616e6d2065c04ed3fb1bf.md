## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:53027b93-7dd8-6266-037a-b7863eaa4ebc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 314–335.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem ofMulAction_self_smul_eq_mul (x : MonoidAlgebra k G) (y : (ofMulAction k G G).asModule) :
    x • y = (x * y : MonoidAlgebra k G) := -- by

/-- If we equip `k[G]` with the `k`-linear `G`-representation induced by the left regular action of
`G` on itself, the resulting object is isomorphic as a `k[G]`-module to `k[G]` with its natural
`k[G]`-module structure. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant2968b090679c7b98898bd0d9d3c51abfe802e0e00a618b322d0753ea69417536.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant2968b090679c7b98898bd0d9d3c51abfe802e0e00a618b322d0753ea69417536.lean#L314).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f8947d692bfa3a5e553bedc0446b642ded4b248` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
