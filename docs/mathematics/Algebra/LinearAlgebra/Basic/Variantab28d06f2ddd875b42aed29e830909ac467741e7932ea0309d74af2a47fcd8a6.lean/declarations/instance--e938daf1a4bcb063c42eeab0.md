## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5b7f06e078e58628ee41b985d7b6fdc7e3ad956847baf19d0bf1d4ed1ca37d81`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 338–348.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : IsCompactlyGenerated (Submodule R M) :=
  ⟨fun s =>
    ⟨(fun x => span R {x}) '' s,
      ⟨fun t ht => by
        rcases (Set.mem_image _ _ _).1 ht with ⟨x, _, rfl⟩
        apply singleton_span_isCompactElement, by
        rw [sSup_eq_iSup, iSup_image, ← span_eq_iSup_of_singleton_spans, span_eq]⟩⟩⟩

variable {M' : Type*} [AddCommMonoid M'] [Module R M'] (q₁ q₁' : Submodule R M')

/-- The product of two submodules is a submodule. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantab28d06f2ddd875b42aed29e830909ac467741e7932ea0309d74af2a47fcd8a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantab28d06f2ddd875b42aed29e830909ac467741e7932ea0309d74af2a47fcd8a6.lean#L338).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `35189106b641ace4ccf0894c8d714e0be8c0fc1b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
