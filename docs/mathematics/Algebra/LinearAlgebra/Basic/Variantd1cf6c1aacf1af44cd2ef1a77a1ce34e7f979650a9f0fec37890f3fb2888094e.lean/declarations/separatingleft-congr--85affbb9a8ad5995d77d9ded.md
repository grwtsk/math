## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fd9d046f-9480-a6c7-311b-6bef538e022f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 614–623.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem SeparatingLeft.congr (h : B.SeparatingLeft) :
    (e₁.arrowCongr (e₂.arrowCongr (LinearEquiv.refl R M)) B).SeparatingLeft := by
  intro x hx
  rw [← e₁.symm.map_eq_zero_iff]
  refine h (e₁.symm x) fun y ↦ ?_
  specialize hx (e₂ y)
  simp only [LinearEquiv.arrowCongr_apply, LinearEquiv.symm_apply_apply,
    LinearEquiv.map_eq_zero_iff] at hx
  exact hx

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantd1cf6c1aacf1af44cd2ef1a77a1ce34e7f979650a9f0fec37890f3fb2888094e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantd1cf6c1aacf1af44cd2ef1a77a1ce34e7f979650a9f0fec37890f3fb2888094e.lean#L614).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ef05c33a6057c9265bfcf4e939e80d39782fdbd2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
