## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:458b04ab4ef028e7eb49ab9153c207b48f27d69bd2683b793f6d3d7d53aa16e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 98–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class LieModule (R : Type u) (L : Type v) (M : Type w) [CommRing R] [LieRing L] [LieAlgebra R L]
  [AddCommGroup M] [Module R M] [LieRingModule L M] : Prop where
  /-- A Lie module bracket is compatible with scalar multiplication in its first argument. -/
  protected smul_lie : ∀ (t : R) (x : L) (m : M), ⁅t • x, m⁆ = t • ⁅x, m⁆
  /-- A Lie module bracket is compatible with scalar multiplication in its second argument. -/
  protected lie_smul : ∀ (t : R) (x : L) (m : M), ⁅x, t • m⁆ = t • ⁅x, m⁆

/-- A tower of Lie bracket actions encapsulates the Leibniz rule for Lie bracket actions.

More precisely, it does so in a relative setting:
Let `L₁` and `L₂` be two types with Lie bracket actions on a type `M` endowed with an addition,
and additionally assume a Lie bracket action of `L₁` on `L₂`.
Then the Leibniz rule asserts for all `x : L₁`, `y : L₂`, and `m : M` that
`⁅x, ⁅y, m⁆⁆ = ⁅⁅x, y⁆, m⁆ + ⁅y, ⁅x, m⁆⁆` holds.

Common examples include the case where `L₁` is a Lie subalgebra of `L₂`
and the case where `L₂` is a Lie ideal of `L₁`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant8d8c65756380578a1f0cf54ae5eceaf1a9481f1baf7244dda46e440715487936.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant8d8c65756380578a1f0cf54ae5eceaf1a9481f1baf7244dda46e440715487936.lean#L98).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28adefd6ef763d3d70cb98e21ded7d0614d3d4a7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
