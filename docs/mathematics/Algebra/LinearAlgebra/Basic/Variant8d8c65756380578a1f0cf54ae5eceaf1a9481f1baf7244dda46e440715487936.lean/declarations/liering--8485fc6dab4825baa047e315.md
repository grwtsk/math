## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:837b7f77414ec61ca905a3450e16a9b13e8f45f97d0a48b62d40475939e774ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 66–77.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class LieRing (L : Type v) extends AddCommGroup L, Bracket L L where
  /-- A Lie ring bracket is additive in its first component. -/
  protected add_lie : ∀ x y z : L, ⁅x + y, z⁆ = ⁅x, z⁆ + ⁅y, z⁆
  /-- A Lie ring bracket is additive in its second component. -/
  protected lie_add : ∀ x y z : L, ⁅x, y + z⁆ = ⁅x, y⁆ + ⁅x, z⁆
  /-- A Lie ring bracket vanishes on the diagonal in L × L. -/
  protected lie_self : ∀ x : L, ⁅x, x⁆ = 0
  /-- A Lie ring bracket satisfies a Leibniz / Jacobi identity. -/
  protected leibniz_lie : ∀ x y z : L, ⁅x, ⁅y, z⁆⁆ = ⁅⁅x, y⁆, z⁆ + ⁅y, ⁅x, z⁆⁆

/-- A Lie algebra is a module with compatible product, known as the bracket, satisfying the Jacobi
identity. Forgetting the scalar multiplication, every Lie algebra is a Lie ring. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant8d8c65756380578a1f0cf54ae5eceaf1a9481f1baf7244dda46e440715487936.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant8d8c65756380578a1f0cf54ae5eceaf1a9481f1baf7244dda46e440715487936.lean#L66).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `28adefd6ef763d3d70cb98e21ded7d0614d3d4a7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
