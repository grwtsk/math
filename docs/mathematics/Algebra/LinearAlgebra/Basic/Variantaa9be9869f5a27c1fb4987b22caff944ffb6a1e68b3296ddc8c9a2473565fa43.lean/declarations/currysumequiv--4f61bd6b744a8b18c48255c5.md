## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0e3a5401e9f4fd722d4be2bb08654dbc6c80c9b967ffdd9af9f55fab0f8f01eb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1499–1518.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def currySumEquiv :
    MultilinearMap R (fun _ : Sum ι ι' => M') M₂ ≃ₗ[R]
      MultilinearMap R (fun _ : ι => M') (MultilinearMap R (fun _ : ι' => M') M₂) where
  toFun := currySum
  invFun := uncurrySum
  left_inv f := ext fun u => by simp
  right_inv f := by
    ext

variable {ι ι' R M₂ M'}

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantaa9be9869f5a27c1fb4987b22caff944ffb6a1e68b3296ddc8c9a2473565fa43.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantaa9be9869f5a27c1fb4987b22caff944ffb6a1e68b3296ddc8c9a2473565fa43.lean#L1499).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c640b7ef79cb08724967a8bfaf13fe4316cd49db` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
