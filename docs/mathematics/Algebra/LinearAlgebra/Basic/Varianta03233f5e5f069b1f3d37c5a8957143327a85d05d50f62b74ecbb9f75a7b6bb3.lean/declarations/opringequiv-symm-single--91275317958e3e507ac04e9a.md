## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f616cec5-8708-f2f7-5d60-71311b5ce2df`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1913–1922.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem opRingEquiv_symm_single [AddCommMonoid G] (r : kᵐᵒᵖ) (x : Gᵐᵒᵖ) :
    AddMonoidAlgebra.opRingEquiv.symm (single x r) = op (single x r.unop) := by simp
#align add_monoid_algebra.op_ring_equiv_symm_single AddMonoidAlgebra.opRingEquiv_symm_single

end Opposite

/-- The instance `Algebra R (AddMonoidAlgebra k G)` whenever we have `Algebra R k`.

In particular this provides the instance `Algebra k (AddMonoidAlgebra k G)`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Varianta03233f5e5f069b1f3d37c5a8957143327a85d05d50f62b74ecbb9f75a7b6bb3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Varianta03233f5e5f069b1f3d37c5a8957143327a85d05d50f62b74ecbb9f75a7b6bb3.lean#L1913).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `505163d603c369fd89805cdd652c5a9491856b5f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
