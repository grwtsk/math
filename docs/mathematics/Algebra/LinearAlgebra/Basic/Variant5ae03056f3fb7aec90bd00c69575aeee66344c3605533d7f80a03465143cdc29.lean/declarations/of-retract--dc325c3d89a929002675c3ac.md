## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e4e3b705-47f7-3651-e6c1-12b834bf3daf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 178–186.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma of_retract [f : Flat R M] (i : N →ₗ[R] M) (r : M →ₗ[R] N) (h : r.comp i = LinearMap.id) :
    Flat R N := by
  rw [iff_rTensor_injectiveₛ] at *
  refine fun P _ _ Q ↦ .of_comp (f := lTensor P i) ?_
  rw [← coe_comp, lTensor_comp_rTensor, ← rTensor_comp_lTensor, coe_comp]
  refine (f Q).comp (Function.RightInverse.injective (g := lTensor Q r) fun x ↦ ?_)
  simp [← comp_apply, ← lTensor_comp, h]

/-- A `R`-module linearly equivalent to a flat `R`-module is flat. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant5ae03056f3fb7aec90bd00c69575aeee66344c3605533d7f80a03465143cdc29.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant5ae03056f3fb7aec90bd00c69575aeee66344c3605533d7f80a03465143cdc29.lean#L178).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `52bcbcc53017e5d1123bc8b382b329968c20cebd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
