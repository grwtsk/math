## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1bfe77fa60308950b6789a00bac3f64e9644f2e5b50b512535039c559b07c5eb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 230–238.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class SMulBracketCommClass (S L α : Type*) [SMul S α] [LieRing L] [AddCommGroup α]
    [LieRingModule L α] : Prop where
  /-- `•` and `⁅⬝, ⬝⁆`  are left commutative -/
  smul_bracket_comm : ∀ (s : S) (l : L) (a : α), s • ⁅l, a⁆ = ⁅l, s • a⁆

variable {S T : Type*}
variable [Monoid S] [DistribMulAction S M] [SMulCommClass R S M] [SMulBracketCommClass S L M]
variable [Monoid T] [DistribMulAction T M] [SMulCommClass R T M] [SMulBracketCommClass T L M]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantcee20d12daafe208db73f47b5448bc93fc88a0858005bb8700009935891021c5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantcee20d12daafe208db73f47b5448bc93fc88a0858005bb8700009935891021c5.lean#L230).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a27ee20340c1624a30708ed0ca644bd1b32a3b6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
