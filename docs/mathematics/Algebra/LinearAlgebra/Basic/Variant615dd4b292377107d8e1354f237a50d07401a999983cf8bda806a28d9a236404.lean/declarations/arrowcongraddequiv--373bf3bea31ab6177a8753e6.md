## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4f69d61ea6361b755c1591b5f71a0c745b915db9cbb792b0b6de5dc6c5da6abb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 569–586.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simps] def arrowCongrAddEquiv (e₁ : M₁ ≃ₛₗ[σ₁₂] M₂) (e₂ : M₁' ≃ₛₗ[σ₁'₂'] M₂') :
    (M₁ →ₛₗ[σ₁₁'] M₁') ≃+ (M₂ →ₛₗ[σ₂₂'] M₂') where
  toFun f := (e₂.comp f).comp e₁.symm.toLinearMap
  invFun f := (e₂.symm.comp f).comp e₁.toLinearMap
  left_inv f := by
    ext x
    simp only [symm_apply_apply, Function.comp_apply, coe_comp, coe_coe]
  right_inv f := by
    ext x
    simp only [Function.comp_apply, apply_symm_apply, coe_comp, coe_coe]
  map_add' f g := by
    ext x
    simp only [map_add, add_apply, Function.comp_apply, coe_comp, coe_coe]

/-- If `M` and `M₂` are linearly isomorphic then the endomorphism rings of `M` and `M₂`
are isomorphic.

See `LinearEquiv.conj` for the linear version of this isomorphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant615dd4b292377107d8e1354f237a50d07401a999983cf8bda806a28d9a236404.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant615dd4b292377107d8e1354f237a50d07401a999983cf8bda806a28d9a236404.lean#L569).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9c54387d3cbce50725b34efe18e010eee528c846` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
