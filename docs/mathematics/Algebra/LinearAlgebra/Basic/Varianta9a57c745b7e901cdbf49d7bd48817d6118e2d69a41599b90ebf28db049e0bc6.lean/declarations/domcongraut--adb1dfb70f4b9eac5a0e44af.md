## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:94958181deb678018521efc7c7790f573aee30403a70531ed47bdd2d545fc40c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 354–362.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def domCongrAut : MulAut M →* A[M] ≃ₐ[R] A[M] where
  toFun := MonoidAlgebra.domCongr R A
  map_one' := by rw [MulAut.one_def, AlgEquiv.aut_one, domCongr_refl]
  map_mul' _ _ := by rw [MulAut.mul_def, AlgEquiv.aut_mul, trans_domCongr_domCongr]

variable (R) in
/-- Nested monoid algebras can be taken in an arbitrary order. -/
@[to_additive
/-- Nested monoid algebras can be taken in an arbitrary order. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Varianta9a57c745b7e901cdbf49d7bd48817d6118e2d69a41599b90ebf28db049e0bc6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Varianta9a57c745b7e901cdbf49d7bd48817d6118e2d69a41599b90ebf28db049e0bc6.lean#L354).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `acf4e3d53f85753325fdead176fa806be1ba130d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
