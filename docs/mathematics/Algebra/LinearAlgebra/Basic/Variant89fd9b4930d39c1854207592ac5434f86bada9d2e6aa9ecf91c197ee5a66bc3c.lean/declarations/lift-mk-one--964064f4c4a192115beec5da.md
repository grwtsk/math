## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:54981978-562d-4357-05c5-e8bb4ec8e937`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 691–698.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma lift_mk_one (h : ∀ (x : S), IsUnit ((algebraMap R (Module.End R M'')) x)) (m : M) :
    (LocalizedModule.lift S g h) (LocalizedModule.mk m 1) = g m := by
  simp [lift_mk]

/--
If `g` is a linear map `M → M''` such that all scalar multiplication by `s : S` is invertible, then
there is a linear map `lift g ∘ mkLinearMap = g`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant89fd9b4930d39c1854207592ac5434f86bada9d2e6aa9ecf91c197ee5a66bc3c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant89fd9b4930d39c1854207592ac5434f86bada9d2e6aa9ecf91c197ee5a66bc3c.lean#L691).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a70e5a646ccd82f36078fe09761a347b25f6bf92` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
