## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ed33a939-b560-76bc-2886-9c42d22a373c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 284–290.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem prod_mk {ι A : Type*} [CommSemiring A] [Algebra R A] {S : Submonoid R}
    (t : Finset ι) (a : ι → A) (s : ι → S) :
    ∏ i ∈ t, mk (a i) (s i) = mk (∏ i ∈ t, a i) (∏ i ∈ t, s i) := by
  induction t using Finset.cons_induction <;> simp [OreLocalization.one_def, *, mk_mul_mk]

/-- If `IsLocalization S T`, then `M[S⁻¹]` has a `T`-action.
This should eventually be replaced with `IsLocalizedModule f N` and `SMul T N`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant89fd9b4930d39c1854207592ac5434f86bada9d2e6aa9ecf91c197ee5a66bc3c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant89fd9b4930d39c1854207592ac5434f86bada9d2e6aa9ecf91c197ee5a66bc3c.lean#L284).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a70e5a646ccd82f36078fe09761a347b25f6bf92` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
