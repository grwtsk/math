## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:722093b287a7a407aba854cfa582f939ba3fe1061d35aeb7e8649f3b497ed33d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 328–333.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instCoalgebraStruct : CoalgebraStruct R (ι →₀ A) where
  comul := Finsupp.lsum R fun i =>
    TensorProduct.map (Finsupp.lsingle i) (Finsupp.lsingle i) ∘ₗ comul
  counit := Finsupp.lsum R fun _ => counit

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantfdc05fe0eea8f59f2bcb8c05d802e49b0290923615017f9f0699d2e66959b174.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantfdc05fe0eea8f59f2bcb8c05d802e49b0290923615017f9f0699d2e66959b174.lean#L328).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bf9a1717a2ff69f61f03d974cf19e7061cb7abc4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
