## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0276e3ec-c748-8c9a-e4d4-03f05b191a98`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 622–633.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem congr_symm_tprod (f : Π i, s i ≃ₗ[R] t i) (p : Π i, t i) :
    (congr f).symm (tprod R p) = tprod R (fun (i : ι) ↦ (f i).symm (p i)) := by
  simp only [congr, LinearEquiv.symm_ofLinearMap, LinearEquiv.coe_ofLinearMap, map_tprod,
    LinearEquiv.coe_coe]

/--
Let `sᵢ`, `tᵢ` and `t'ᵢ` be families of `R`-modules, then `f : Πᵢ sᵢ → tᵢ → t'ᵢ` induces an
element of `Hom(⨂ᵢ sᵢ, Hom(⨂ tᵢ, ⨂ᵢ t'ᵢ))` defined by `⨂ᵢ aᵢ ↦ ⨂ᵢ bᵢ ↦ ⨂ᵢ fᵢ aᵢ bᵢ`.

This is `PiTensorProduct.map` for two arbitrary families of modules.
This is `TensorProduct.map₂` for families of modules.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantf69c65605a638e5769c88a4fb3712c20f80560021b3e15edab98666d62046e0a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantf69c65605a638e5769c88a4fb3712c20f80560021b3e15edab98666d62046e0a.lean#L622).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5051bd402b46b2aa8f7a12a5a49cced3aee092d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
