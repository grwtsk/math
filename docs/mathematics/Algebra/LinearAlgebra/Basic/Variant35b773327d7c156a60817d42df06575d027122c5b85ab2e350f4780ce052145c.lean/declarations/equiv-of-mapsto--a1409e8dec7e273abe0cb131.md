## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5efddc54f174939de26e932eeeb572bcb84dcd59a5a737fe794978d16e9f05e2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def equiv_of_mapsTo :
    ι ≃ ι where
  toFun j := (exist_eq_reflection_of_mapsTo p root coroot i j h).choose
  invFun j := (exist_eq_reflection_of_mapsTo p root coroot i j h).choose
  left_inv j := choose_choose_eq_of_mapsTo p root coroot i j h hp
  right_inv j := choose_choose_eq_of_mapsTo p root coroot i j h hp

end reflection_perm

variable (P : RootPairing ι R M N) [Finite ι]

/-- Even though the roots may not span, coroots are distinguished by their pairing with the
roots. The proof depends crucially on the fact that there are finitely-many roots.

Modulo trivial generalisations, this statement is exactly Lemma 1.1.4 on page 87 of SGA 3 XXI. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant35b773327d7c156a60817d42df06575d027122c5b85ab2e350f4780ce052145c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant35b773327d7c156a60817d42df06575d027122c5b85ab2e350f4780ce052145c.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d6d3a61f6cbfb95e727083ff9be7c026a7283e9f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
