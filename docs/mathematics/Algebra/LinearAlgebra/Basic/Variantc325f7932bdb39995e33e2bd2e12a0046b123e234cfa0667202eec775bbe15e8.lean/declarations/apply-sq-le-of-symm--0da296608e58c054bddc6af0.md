## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b9953788-0b98-6051-e119-a3f7a5c98910`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 852–857.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma apply_sq_le_of_symm (hs : ∀ x, 0 ≤ B x x) (hB : B.IsSymm) (x y : M) :
    (B x y) ^ 2 ≤ (B x x) * (B y y) := by
  rw [show (B x y) ^ 2 = (B x y) * (B y x) by rw [sq, ← hB.eq, RingHom.id_apply]]
  exact apply_mul_apply_le_of_forall_zero_le B hs x y

/-- The equality case of **Cauchy-Schwarz**. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc325f7932bdb39995e33e2bd2e12a0046b123e234cfa0667202eec775bbe15e8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc325f7932bdb39995e33e2bd2e12a0046b123e234cfa0667202eec775bbe15e8.lean#L852).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b936a4c813ee9e5ce378488e6a7c539c4641b693` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
