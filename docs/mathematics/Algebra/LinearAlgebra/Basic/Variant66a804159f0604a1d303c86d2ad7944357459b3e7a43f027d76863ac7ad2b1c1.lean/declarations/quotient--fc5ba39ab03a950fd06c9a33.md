## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5a6a73461250cc0b6546a74c2d0ebf06d2490306391b0907be141034695ca39b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 231–236.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance quotient (R) {A M} [Semiring R] [AddCommGroup M] [Ring A] [Module A M] [Module R M]
    [SMul R A] [IsScalarTower R A M] [Module.Finite R M]
    (N : Submodule A M) : Module.Finite R (M ⧸ N) :=
  Module.Finite.of_surjective (N.mkQ.restrictScalars R) N.mkQ_surjective

/-- The range of a linear map from a finite module is finite. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant66a804159f0604a1d303c86d2ad7944357459b3e7a43f027d76863ac7ad2b1c1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant66a804159f0604a1d303c86d2ad7944357459b3e7a43f027d76863ac7ad2b1c1.lean#L231).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `928770a40fe94a33af08cd62083390bd38a1b73c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
