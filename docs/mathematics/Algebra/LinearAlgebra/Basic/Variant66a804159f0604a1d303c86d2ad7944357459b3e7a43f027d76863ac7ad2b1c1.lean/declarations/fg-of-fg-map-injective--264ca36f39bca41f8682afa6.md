## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5bd58e7b-d3ad-c62c-3a77-022923aa63aa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 83–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem fg_of_fg_map_injective (hf : Function.Injective f) {N : Submodule R M}
    (hfn : (N.map f).FG) : N.FG :=
  let ⟨t, ht⟩ := hfn
  ⟨t.preimage f fun _ _ _ _ h => hf h,
    Submodule.map_injective_of_injective hf <| by
      rw [map_span, Finset.coe_preimage, Set.image_preimage_eq_inter_range,
        Set.inter_eq_self_of_subset_left, ht]
      rw [← LinearMap.range_coe, ← span_le, ht, ← map_top]
      exact map_mono le_top⟩

end

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant66a804159f0604a1d303c86d2ad7944357459b3e7a43f027d76863ac7ad2b1c1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant66a804159f0604a1d303c86d2ad7944357459b3e7a43f027d76863ac7ad2b1c1.lean#L83).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `928770a40fe94a33af08cd62083390bd38a1b73c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
