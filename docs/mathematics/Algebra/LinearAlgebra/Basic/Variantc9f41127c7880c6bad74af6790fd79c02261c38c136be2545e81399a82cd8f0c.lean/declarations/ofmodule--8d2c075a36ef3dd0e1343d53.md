## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1dbf2a3b239e1e9717999ac0544ce9032c652fed22bd3480080e0201135f7cea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 179–204.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def ofModule : Representation k G (RestrictScalars k (MonoidAlgebra k G) M) :=
  (MonoidAlgebra.lift k G
        (RestrictScalars k (MonoidAlgebra k G) M →ₗ[k]
          RestrictScalars k (MonoidAlgebra k G) M)).symm
    (RestrictScalars.lsmul k (MonoidAlgebra k G) M)
#align representation.of_module Representation.ofModule

/-!
## `ofModule` and `asModule` are inverses.

This requires a little care in both directions:
this is a categorical equivalence, not an isomorphism.

See `Rep.equivalenceModuleMonoidAlgebra` for the full statement.

Starting with `ρ : Representation k G V`, converting to a module and back again
we have a `Representation k G (restrictScalars k (MonoidAlgebra k G) ρ.asModule)`.
To compare these, we use the composition of `restrictScalarsAddEquiv` and `ρ.asModuleEquiv`.

Similarly, starting with `Module (MonoidAlgebra k G) M`,
after we convert to a representation and back to a module,
we have `Module (MonoidAlgebra k G) (restrictScalars k (MonoidAlgebra k G) M)`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc9f41127c7880c6bad74af6790fd79c02261c38c136be2545e81399a82cd8f0c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc9f41127c7880c6bad74af6790fd79c02261c38c136be2545e81399a82cd8f0c.lean#L179).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f1fb8da23505f21f17be9d4eb3fa064410ff8046` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
