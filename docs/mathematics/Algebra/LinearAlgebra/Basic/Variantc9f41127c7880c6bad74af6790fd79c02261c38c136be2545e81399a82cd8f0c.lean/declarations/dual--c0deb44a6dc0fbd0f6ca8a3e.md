## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:75b8480d11ba7c797c5a9bbb0b1e08645c5fdd11c3b23acc3ce1f8a7e6220f60`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 431–448.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def dual : Representation k G (Module.Dual k V) where
  toFun g :=
    { toFun := fun f => f ∘ₗ ρV g⁻¹
      map_add' := fun f₁ f₂ => by simp only [add_comp]
      map_smul' := fun r f => by
        ext
        simp only [coe_comp, Function.comp_apply, smul_apply, RingHom.id_apply] }
  map_one' := by
    ext
    dsimp -- Porting note: now needed
    simp only [coe_comp, Function.comp_apply, map_one, inv_one, coe_mk, one_apply]
  map_mul' g h := by
    ext
    dsimp -- Porting note: now needed
    simp only [coe_comp, Function.comp_apply, mul_inv_rev, map_mul, coe_mk, mul_apply]
#align representation.dual Representation.dual

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc9f41127c7880c6bad74af6790fd79c02261c38c136be2545e81399a82cd8f0c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantc9f41127c7880c6bad74af6790fd79c02261c38c136be2545e81399a82cd8f0c.lean#L431).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f1fb8da23505f21f17be9d4eb3fa064410ff8046` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
