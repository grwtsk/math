## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:12cca4d5a88c63e3fbb0d6e6a2c616c842bbf9ad08e3a3b1022a546f1cd8d204`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 127–134.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def Function.Injective.module [AddCommMonoid M₂] [SMul R M₂] (f : M₂ →+ M)
    (hf : Injective f) (smul : ∀ (c : R) (x), f (c • x) = c • f x) : Module R M₂ :=
  { hf.distribMulAction f smul with
    add_smul := fun c₁ c₂ x => hf <| by simp only [smul, f.map_add, add_smul]
    zero_smul := fun x => hf <| by simp only [smul, zero_smul, f.map_zero] }
#align function.injective.module Function.Injective.module

/-- Pushforward a `Module` structure along a surjective additive monoid homomorphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant130c902b6fdf65fd757d3d8c36f889001418dd494751e15ba831ae35951c6db2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant130c902b6fdf65fd757d3d8c36f889001418dd494751e15ba831ae35951c6db2.lean#L127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `62d340abd45db6f4ac8c04623a3f4201783ff816` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
