## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:737df3fd-e94d-59e8-7f06-84f19b4a372a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 597–620.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

## Specific index computations for Fredholm operators

In this section, we restate for Fredholm operators some general algebraic results about
`LinearMap.index`. Ideally we wouldn't need such a section at all, but as of August 2026
it is easier to work with the API for `IsFredholm` than with the specific finiteness assumptions
used, for example, in `LinearMap.index_comp`.

This suggests that we may want an algebraic version of the `IsFredholm` predicate to express
"this linear map has finite dimensional kernel and cokernel", or equivalently "this linear map
admits a quasi-inverse". The API would then mimic that of `IsFredholm`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant1da4db9ea29179598da9389bceb8fd1936107ba2d0f7d1c5d364486e3d200ce1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ae1ab396b95aa2c356622d81c023ef6f6e264de1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
