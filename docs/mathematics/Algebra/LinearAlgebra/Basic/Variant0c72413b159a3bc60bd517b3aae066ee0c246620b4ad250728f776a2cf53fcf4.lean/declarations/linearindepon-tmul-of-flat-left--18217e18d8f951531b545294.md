## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6ef64334-ccad-c582-2936-53f17d6c340e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 519–527.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
nonrec lemma LinearIndepOn.tmul_of_flat_left [Module.Flat R M] (hv : LinearIndepOn R v s)
    (hw : LinearIndepOn R w t) : LinearIndepOn R (fun i : ι × κ ↦ v i.1 ⊗ₜ[R] w i.2) (s ×ˢ t) :=
  ((hv.tmul_of_flat_left hw).comp _ (Equiv.Set.prod _ _).injective :)

/-- Tensor product of linearly independent families is linearly
independent under some flatness conditions.

The flatness condition could be removed over domains.
See `LinearIndependent.tmul_of_isDomain`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant0c72413b159a3bc60bd517b3aae066ee0c246620b4ad250728f776a2cf53fcf4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant0c72413b159a3bc60bd517b3aae066ee0c246620b4ad250728f776a2cf53fcf4.lean#L519).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a596ea3cb58f0c246a49e1f4b46a8ef282703014` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
