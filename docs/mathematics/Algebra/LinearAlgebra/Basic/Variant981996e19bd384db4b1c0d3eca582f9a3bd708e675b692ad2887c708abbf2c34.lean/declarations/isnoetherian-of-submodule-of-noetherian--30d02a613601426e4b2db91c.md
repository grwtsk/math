## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:098aee15-cc16-287e-0951-282164faddb0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 322–327.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isNoetherian_of_submodule_of_noetherian (R M) [Semiring R] [AddCommMonoid M] [Module R M]
    (N : Submodule R M) (h : IsNoetherian R M) : IsNoetherian R N :=
  isNoetherian_mk (OrderEmbedding.wellFounded (Submodule.MapSubtype.orderEmbedding N).dual h.wf)

/-- If `M / S / R` is a scalar tower, and `M / R` is Noetherian, then `M / S` is
also Noetherian. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant981996e19bd384db4b1c0d3eca582f9a3bd708e675b692ad2887c708abbf2c34.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant981996e19bd384db4b1c0d3eca582f9a3bd708e675b692ad2887c708abbf2c34.lean#L322).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `81aa607dd5e793f8b4ab2e1a6b6753ad0a55f5f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
