## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5e0d2ece-0bf2-e8cf-5cd6-a3451e5b87ea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 825–830.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem toQuadraticForm_associated : (associatedHom S Q).toQuadraticForm = Q :=
  QuadraticForm.ext <| associated_eq_self_apply S Q
#align quadratic_form.to_quadratic_form_associated QuadraticForm.toQuadraticForm_associated

-- note: usually `rightInverse` lemmas are named the other way around, but this is consistent
-- with historical naming in this file.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant5fdd513181c3f4bdb3aeb732f206d685f05569c081cf446fbf94f33e36132d65.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variant5fdd513181c3f4bdb3aeb732f206d685f05569c081cf446fbf94f33e36132d65.lean#L825).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1e9b3dcac3f8ec67e76b7bcc5bc844be648147cd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
