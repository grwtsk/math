## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:40a341a4-f4b9-0647-0d2c-b79bea083e21`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 103–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Matrix.charpoly_reindex {m : Type v} [DecidableEq m] [Fintype m] (e : n ≃ m)
    (M : Matrix n n R) : (reindex e e M).charpoly = M.charpoly := by
  unfold Matrix.charpoly
  rw [charmatrix_reindex, Matrix.det_reindex_self]
#align matrix.charpoly_reindex Matrix.charpoly_reindex

-- This proof follows http://drorbn.net/AcademicPensieve/2015-12/CayleyHamilton.pdf
/-- The **Cayley-Hamilton Theorem**, that the characteristic polynomial of a matrix,
applied to the matrix itself, is zero.

This holds over any commutative ring.

See `LinearMap.aeval_self_charpoly` for the equivalent statement about endomorphisms.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantb8a5da53da93f230d93d199fde778a3ac249455b5191332a91637f6ffce73b01.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basic/Variantb8a5da53da93f230d93d199fde778a3ac249455b5191332a91637f6ffce73b01.lean#L103).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e71aeb47f18cbeed6f8e30ec5d14863bbdbe4daa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
