## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:663fe971-7d17-8e48-cdac-d58ca4e2cc70`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 360–366.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem toAlgAut_bijective [Finite G] [FaithfulSMul G F] :
    Function.Bijective (MulSemiringAction.toAlgAut G (FixedPoints.subfield G F) F) := by
  refine ⟨fun _ _ h ↦ (FixedPoints.toAlgHom_bijective G F).injective ?_,
    fun f ↦ ((FixedPoints.toAlgHom_bijective G F).surjective f).imp (fun _ h ↦ ?_)⟩ <;>
      rwa [DFunLike.ext_iff] at h ⊢

/-- Bijection between `G` and algebra automorphisms of `F` that fix the fixed points. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Fixed/Variant96a461151c3fda0cd396b15893c8ca2125c8e098977365976ad5f915b1652ccf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Fixed/Variant96a461151c3fda0cd396b15893c8ca2125c8e098977365976ad5f915b1652ccf.lean#L360).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c9f644c80bb1e8de365d21dcfd28821d6bef15be` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
