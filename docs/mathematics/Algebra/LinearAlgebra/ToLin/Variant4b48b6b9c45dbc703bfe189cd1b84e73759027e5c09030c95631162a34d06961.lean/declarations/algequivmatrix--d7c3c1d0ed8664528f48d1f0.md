## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1cb11e463b28448dd01bb2fb059a34c053b2269ce43ec88a522d00e72e9fafbf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 918–941.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def algEquivMatrix [Fintype n] (h : Basis n R M) : Module.End R M ≃ₐ[R] Matrix n n R :=
  (h.equivFun.algConj R).trans algEquivMatrix'

end

namespace Basis

variable {R M M₁ M₂ ι ι₁ ι₂ : Type*} [CommSemiring R]
variable [AddCommMonoid M] [AddCommMonoid M₁] [AddCommMonoid M₂]
variable [Module R M] [Module R M₁] [Module R M₂]
variable [Fintype ι] [Fintype ι₁] [Fintype ι₂]
variable [DecidableEq ι] [DecidableEq ι₁]
variable (b : Basis ι R M) (b₁ : Basis ι₁ R M₁) (b₂ : Basis ι₂ R M₂)

/-- The standard basis of the space linear maps between two modules
induced by a basis of the domain and codomain.

If `M₁` and `M₂` are modules with basis `b₁` and `b₂` respectively indexed
by finite types `ι₁` and `ι₂`,
then `Basis.linearMap b₁ b₂` is the basis of `M₁ →ₗ[R] M₂` indexed by `ι₂ × ι₁`
where `(i, j)` indexes the linear map that sends `b j` to `b i`
and sends all other basis vectors to `0`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ToLin/Variant4b48b6b9c45dbc703bfe189cd1b84e73759027e5c09030c95631162a34d06961.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ToLin/Variant4b48b6b9c45dbc703bfe189cd1b84e73759027e5c09030c95631162a34d06961.lean#L918).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f34c0630f913e221d1aa2781e637e2f5e4616fbd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
