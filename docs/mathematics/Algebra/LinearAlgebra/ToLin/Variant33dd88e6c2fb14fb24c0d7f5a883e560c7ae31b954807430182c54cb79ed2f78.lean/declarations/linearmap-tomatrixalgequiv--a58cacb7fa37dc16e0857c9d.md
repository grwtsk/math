## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6ad259940e49c2a07b4a9592391d34ccce8c984d83d9039a328754dec3b8bf88`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 677–682.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def LinearMap.toMatrixAlgEquiv : (M₁ →ₗ[R] M₁) ≃ₐ[R] Matrix n n R :=
  AlgEquiv.ofLinearEquiv
    (LinearMap.toMatrix v₁ v₁) (LinearMap.toMatrix_one v₁) (LinearMap.toMatrix_mul v₁)

/-- Given a basis of a module `M₁` over a commutative ring `R`, we get an algebra
equivalence between square matrices over `R` indexed by the basis and linear maps `M₁ →ₗ M₁`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ToLin/Variant33dd88e6c2fb14fb24c0d7f5a883e560c7ae31b954807430182c54cb79ed2f78.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ToLin/Variant33dd88e6c2fb14fb24c0d7f5a883e560c7ae31b954807430182c54cb79ed2f78.lean#L677).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a9b105417221d0ae3ae5afb6342870aff58f0a9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
