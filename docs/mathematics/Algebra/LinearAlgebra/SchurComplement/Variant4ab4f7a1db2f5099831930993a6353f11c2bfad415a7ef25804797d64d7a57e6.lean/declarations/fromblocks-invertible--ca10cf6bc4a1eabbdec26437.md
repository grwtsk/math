## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:36b61d9d40dedd2d83f57dafa9e67f3daffb6b839166f90c13c9ba8e596a592b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 267–280.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def fromBlocks₁₁Invertible (A : Matrix m m α) (B : Matrix m n α) (C : Matrix n m α)
    (D : Matrix n n α) [Invertible A] [Invertible (D - C * ⅟ A * B)] :
    Invertible (fromBlocks A B C D) := by
  -- we argue by symmetry
  letI := fromBlocks₂₂Invertible D C B A
  letI iDCBA :=
    submatrixEquivInvertible (fromBlocks D C B A) (Equiv.sumComm _ _) (Equiv.sumComm _ _)
  exact
    iDCBA.copy' _
      (fromBlocks (⅟ A + ⅟ A * B * ⅟ (D - C * ⅟ A * B) * C * ⅟ A) (-(⅟ A * B * ⅟ (D - C * ⅟ A * B)))
        (-(⅟ (D - C * ⅟ A * B) * C * ⅟ A)) (⅟ (D - C * ⅟ A * B)))
      (fromBlocks_submatrix_sum_swap_sum_swap _ _ _ _).symm
      (fromBlocks_submatrix_sum_swap_sum_swap _ _ _ _).symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SchurComplement/Variant4ab4f7a1db2f5099831930993a6353f11c2bfad415a7ef25804797d64d7a57e6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SchurComplement/Variant4ab4f7a1db2f5099831930993a6353f11c2bfad415a7ef25804797d64d7a57e6.lean#L267).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e677c02d658b0a799aee2f190b95b3ad631cd1dd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
