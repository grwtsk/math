## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0f908588-6e4c-55c4-46c8-b94f052d4604`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 194–203.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isUnit_fromBlocks_zero₂₁ {A : Matrix m m α} {B : Matrix m n α} {D : Matrix n n α} :
    IsUnit (fromBlocks A B 0 D) ↔ IsUnit A ∧ IsUnit D := by
  simp only [← nonempty_invertible_iff_isUnit, ← nonempty_prod,
    (fromBlocksZero₂₁InvertibleEquiv _ _ _).nonempty_congr]
#align matrix.is_unit_from_blocks_zero₂₁ Matrix.isUnit_fromBlocks_zero₂₁

/-- A lower block-triangular matrix is invertible iff both elements of its diagonal are.

This is a propositional form of `Matrix.fromBlocksZero₁₂InvertibleEquiv` forms an `iff`. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SchurComplement/Variant0e5fbead688cb211cfc5ed68053aa54e2383bfac7cc6a76b2e65860d3bd5e5f0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SchurComplement/Variant0e5fbead688cb211cfc5ed68053aa54e2383bfac7cc6a76b2e65860d3bd5e5f0.lean#L194).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e59d6048d6cb307cdee7c9aa697c59463c0b30b6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
