## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:54fe3716-df4d-b746-1fc6-79c1dc5e7387`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 282–292.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem invOf_fromBlocks₁₁_eq (A : Matrix m m α) (B : Matrix m n α) (C : Matrix n m α)
    (D : Matrix n n α) [Invertible A] [Invertible (D - C * ⅟ A * B)]
    [Invertible (fromBlocks A B C D)] :
    ⅟ (fromBlocks A B C D) =
      fromBlocks (⅟ A + ⅟ A * B * ⅟ (D - C * ⅟ A * B) * C * ⅟ A) (-(⅟ A * B * ⅟ (D - C * ⅟ A * B)))
        (-(⅟ (D - C * ⅟ A * B) * C * ⅟ A)) (⅟ (D - C * ⅟ A * B)) := by
  letI := fromBlocks₁₁Invertible A B C D
  convert (rfl : ⅟ (fromBlocks A B C D) = _)

/-- If a block matrix is invertible and so is its bottom left element, then so is the corresponding
Schur complement. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SchurComplement/Variantd0812dfde807c1d126f6142268dadc11fa0d738f22b58f69eb1921cc95396143.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SchurComplement/Variantd0812dfde807c1d126f6142268dadc11fa0d738f22b58f69eb1921cc95396143.lean#L282).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `63a5a216c3ed66af6a10637702bc0d666b89bf31` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
