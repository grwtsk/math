## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:aa74e052512c012b3d0b3285d7f0a1bf56b5c727c89f585c52db748a58df7ca7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 347–357.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def invertibleEquivFromBlocks₂₂Invertible (A : Matrix m m α) (B : Matrix m n α) (C : Matrix n m α)
    (D : Matrix n n α) [Invertible D] :
    Invertible (fromBlocks A B C D) ≃ Invertible (A - B * ⅟ D * C) where
  toFun _iABCD := invertibleOfFromBlocks₂₂Invertible _ _ _ _
  invFun _i_schur := fromBlocks₂₂Invertible _ _ _ _
  left_inv _iABCD := Subsingleton.elim _ _
  right_inv _i_schur := Subsingleton.elim _ _
#align matrix.invertible_equiv_from_blocks₂₂_invertible Matrix.invertibleEquivFromBlocks₂₂Invertible

/-- `Matrix.invertibleOfFromBlocks₁₁Invertible` and `Matrix.fromBlocks₁₁Invertible` as an
equivalence. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SchurComplement/Variant829520a6c412efd9fae94ae9f43c7d3b509947fbbb6c61e5de37c14076e70972.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SchurComplement/Variant829520a6c412efd9fae94ae9f43c7d3b509947fbbb6c61e5de37c14076e70972.lean#L347).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27418df2c626cc39a3a437b5a9d02a4b3c62b3b7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
