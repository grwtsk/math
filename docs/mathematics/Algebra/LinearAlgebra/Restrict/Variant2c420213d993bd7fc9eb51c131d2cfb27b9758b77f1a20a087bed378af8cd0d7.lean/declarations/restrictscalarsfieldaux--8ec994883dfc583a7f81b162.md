## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5fdcc6943c4fc3abc8444bc1323d0a0219b2e18a58dff9d66b9750890b375a46`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 228–242.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def restrictScalarsFieldAux
    (hM : span L (LinearMap.range i : Set M) = ⊤)
    (hN : span L (LinearMap.range j : Set N) = ⊤)
    (hp : ∀ m n, p (i m) (j n) ∈ (algebraMap K L).range) :
    PerfectPairing K M' N' := by
  suffices FiniteDimensional K M' from mkOfInjective _ (p.restrictScalarsAux_injective i j hi hN hp)
    (p.flip.restrictScalarsAux_injective j i hj hM (fun m n ↦ hp n m))
  obtain ⟨n, -, b', -⟩ := p.exists_basis_basis_of_span_eq_top_of_mem_algebraMap _ _ hM hN <| by
    rintro - ⟨m, rfl⟩ - ⟨n, rfl⟩
    exact hp m n
  have : FiniteDimensional K (LinearMap.range i) := FiniteDimensional.of_fintype_basis b'
  exact Finite.equiv (LinearEquiv.ofInjective i hi).symm

/-- Simultaneously restrict both the domains and scalars of a perfect pairing with coefficients in a
field. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Restrict/Variant2c420213d993bd7fc9eb51c131d2cfb27b9758b77f1a20a087bed378af8cd0d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Restrict/Variant2c420213d993bd7fc9eb51c131d2cfb27b9758b77f1a20a087bed378af8cd0d7.lean#L228).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1080f3a5309f94a202bfe038ff5e84358e8e61bb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
