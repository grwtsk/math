## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7c27ffc91d74a9f57036ece082d2e60bf161672d59c16ed88a458890c0601e43`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 453–460.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def _root_.Basis.unique {ι : Type*} (b : Basis ι R R) : Unique ι := by
  have : Cardinal.mk ι = ↑(Module.finrank R R) := (Module.mk_finrank_eq_card_basis b).symm
  have : Subsingleton ι ∧ Nonempty ι := by simpa [Cardinal.eq_one_iff_unique]
  exact Nonempty.some ((unique_iff_subsingleton_and_nonempty _).2 this)

variable (M)

/-- The rank of a finite module is finite. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/StrongRankCondition/Variant0ee15b1dff3125460654a659339dc03f5897504fd91f1cb8713476d85fe8e539.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/StrongRankCondition/Variant0ee15b1dff3125460654a659339dc03f5897504fd91f1cb8713476d85fe8e539.lean#L453).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1e612be22f5f7394aa07d0c3f388790d19d4ae00` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
