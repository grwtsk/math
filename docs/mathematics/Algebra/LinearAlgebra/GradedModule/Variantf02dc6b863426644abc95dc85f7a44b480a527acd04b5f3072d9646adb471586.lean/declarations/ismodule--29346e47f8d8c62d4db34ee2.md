## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:48accd5a07a031bfcdb3172149387045ccc335960d718e1b01e9083c1bbf70bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 210–216.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def isModule : Module A (⨁ i, 𝓜 i) :=
  { Module.compHom _ (DirectSum.decomposeRingEquiv 𝓐 : A ≃+* ⨁ i, 𝓐 i).toRingHom with
    smul := fun a b => DirectSum.decompose 𝓐 a • b }

/-- `⨁ i, 𝓜 i` and `M` are isomorphic as `A`-modules.
"The internal version" and "the external version" are isomorphism as `A`-modules.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/GradedModule/Variantf02dc6b863426644abc95dc85f7a44b480a527acd04b5f3072d9646adb471586.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/GradedModule/Variantf02dc6b863426644abc95dc85f7a44b480a527acd04b5f3072d9646adb471586.lean#L210).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c488c676fde63d13c1c7c450c2a80f35bca1b2ed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
