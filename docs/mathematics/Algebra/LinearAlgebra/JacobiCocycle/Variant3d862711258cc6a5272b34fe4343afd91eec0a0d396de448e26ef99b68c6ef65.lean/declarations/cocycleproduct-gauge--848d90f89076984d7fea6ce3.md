## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:54e1d1d6-6898-afb8-14c7-d344e427b65a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–146.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cocycleProduct_gauge {S : Type u} {G : Type v} [Group G]
    (T : S → S) (A B : S → G) (n : ℕ) (x : S) :
    cocycleProduct T (cocycleGaugeTransfer T A B) n x =
      (B (T^[n] x))⁻¹ * cocycleProduct T A n x * B x := by
  induction n with
  | zero => simp
  | succ n ih =>
    simp [cocycleProduct_succ, cocycleGaugeTransfer, ih,
      Function.iterate_succ_apply', mul_assoc]

/-- A varying gauge has the next inverse on the left and the current gauge on the right. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/JacobiCocycle/Variant3d862711258cc6a5272b34fe4343afd91eec0a0d396de448e26ef99b68c6ef65.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/JacobiCocycle/Variant3d862711258cc6a5272b34fe4343afd91eec0a0d396de448e26ef99b68c6ef65.lean#L136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fcf5fec08a2312282fde4a34f92ad440b230e08f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
