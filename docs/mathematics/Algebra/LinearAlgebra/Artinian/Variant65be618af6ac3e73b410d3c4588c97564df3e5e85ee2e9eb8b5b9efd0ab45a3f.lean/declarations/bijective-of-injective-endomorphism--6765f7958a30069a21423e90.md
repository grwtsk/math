## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:715c70cd-bb7b-352c-eb5c-cb2b1fd60ccd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 248–254.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem bijective_of_injective_endomorphism (f : M →ₗ[R] M) (s : Injective f) : Bijective f :=
  ⟨s, surjective_of_injective_endomorphism f s⟩
#align is_artinian.bijective_of_injective_endomorphism IsArtinian.bijective_of_injective_endomorphism

/-- A sequence `f` of submodules of an artinian module,
with the supremum `f (n+1)` and the infimum of `f 0`, ..., `f n` being ⊤,
is eventually ⊤. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Artinian/Variant65be618af6ac3e73b410d3c4588c97564df3e5e85ee2e9eb8b5b9efd0ab45a3f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Artinian/Variant65be618af6ac3e73b410d3c4588c97564df3e5e85ee2e9eb8b5b9efd0ab45a3f.lean#L248).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e724beaa9986d7122091e6906db8b3c3be9a6233` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
