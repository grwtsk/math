## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e1f7f9d2bda3cecb7ea3ee42af07ef2c99021a4784bbdb1e4acee9518c0e2874`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 455–461.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isMaximal_of_isPrime (p : Ideal R) [p.IsPrime] : p.IsMaximal :=
  Ideal.Quotient.maximal_of_isField _ <|
    (MulEquiv.ofBijective _ ⟨IsFractionRing.injective (R ⧸ p) (FractionRing (R ⧸ p)),
      localization_surjective (nonZeroDivisors (R ⧸ p)) (FractionRing (R ⧸ p))⟩).isField _
    <| Field.toIsField <| FractionRing (R ⧸ p)

end IsArtinianRing
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Artinian/Variant65be618af6ac3e73b410d3c4588c97564df3e5e85ee2e9eb8b5b9efd0ab45a3f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Artinian/Variant65be618af6ac3e73b410d3c4588c97564df3e5e85ee2e9eb8b5b9efd0ab45a3f.lean#L455).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e724beaa9986d7122091e6906db8b3c3be9a6233` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
