## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c6815d6b-3d7f-9e88-6049-f05452e850c8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 930–935.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma apply_sq_lt_iff_linearIndependent_of_symm [NoZeroSMulDivisors R M]
    (hp : ∀ x, x ≠ 0 → 0 < B x x) (hB: B.IsSymm) (x y : M) :
    (B x y) ^ 2 < (B x x) * (B y y) ↔ LinearIndependent R ![x, y] := by
  rw [show (B x y) ^ 2 = (B x y) * (B y x) by rw [sq, ← hB, RingHom.id_apply]]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SesquilinearForm/Variant5b5c013725063fd94230e7f7b05f08baaed3c2af30a3f2541917f200c2d4ba51.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SesquilinearForm/Variant5b5c013725063fd94230e7f7b05f08baaed3c2af30a3f2541917f200c2d4ba51.lean#L930).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f375bbc35d14c25e01650cd8ddfab95f811d94b4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
