## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f30e2fe8e8f515e7e784abaa900a087594b1e3f9a6dbf3549de19a43c6c04eee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 337–345.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def LinearMap.toMatrix₂ : (M₁ →ₛₗ[σ₁] M₂ →ₛₗ[σ₂] N₂) ≃ₗ[R] Matrix n m N₂ :=
  (b₁.equivFun.arrowCongr (b₂.equivFun.arrowCongr (LinearEquiv.refl R N₂))).trans
    (LinearMap.toMatrixₛₗ₂' R)

variable (σ₁) in
/-- `Matrix.toLinearMapₛₗ₂ b₁ b₂` is the equivalence between `R`-sesquilinear maps
`M₁ →ₛₗ[σ₁] M₂ →ₗ[R] N₂` and `n`-by-`m` matrices with entries in `N₂`,
if `b₁` and `b₂` are `R`-bases for `M₁` and `M₂`,
respectively; this is the reverse direction of `LinearMap.toMatrix₂ b₁ b₂`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SesquilinearForm/Variant1146797e26d0e4ae21d16f955fda0e1f0ac99fecb09368f1b12faa093536a1d2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SesquilinearForm/Variant1146797e26d0e4ae21d16f955fda0e1f0ac99fecb09368f1b12faa093536a1d2.lean#L337).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `42bae6dc806fc117d684dd10ca0235f0250a36f6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
