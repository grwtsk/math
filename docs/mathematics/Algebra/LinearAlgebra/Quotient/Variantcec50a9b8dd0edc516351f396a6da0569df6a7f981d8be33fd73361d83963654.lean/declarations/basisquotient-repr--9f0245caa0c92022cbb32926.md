## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:49f9d767-d444-0171-3a04-f2b8d4403c02`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 103–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma basisQuotient_repr {ι} [Fintype ι] (b : Basis ι R S) (x) (i) :
    (basisQuotient b).repr (Ideal.Quotient.mk pS x) i =
    Ideal.Quotient.mk p (b.repr x i) := by
  refine congr_fun (g := Ideal.Quotient.mk p ∘ b.repr x) ?_ i
  apply (Finsupp.linearEquivFunOnFinite (R ⧸ p) _ _).symm.injective
  apply (basisQuotient b).repr.symm.injective
  simp only [Finsupp.linearEquivFunOnFinite_symm_coe, LinearEquiv.symm_apply_apply,
    Basis.repr_symm_apply]
  rw [Finsupp.linearCombination_eq_fintype_linearCombination_apply (R ⧸ p),
    Fintype.linearCombination_apply]
  simp only [Function.comp_apply, basisQuotient_apply,
    Ideal.Quotient.mk_smul_mk_quotient_map_quotient, ← Algebra.smul_def]
  rw [← map_sum, Basis.sum_repr b x]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Quotient/Variantcec50a9b8dd0edc516351f396a6da0569df6a7f981d8be33fd73361d83963654.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Quotient/Variantcec50a9b8dd0edc516351f396a6da0569df6a7f981d8be33fd73361d83963654.lean#L103).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7ddc2aca79c8bcfb6799ffb7df9dee827f29a6fd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
