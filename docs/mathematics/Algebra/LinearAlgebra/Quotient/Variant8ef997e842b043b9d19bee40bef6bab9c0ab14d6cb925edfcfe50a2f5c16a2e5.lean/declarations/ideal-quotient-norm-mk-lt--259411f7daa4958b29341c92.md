## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4ab6e37b-bfc2-a405-b1d8-a85e9c01cf6e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 492–495.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
nonrec theorem Ideal.Quotient.norm_mk_lt {I : Ideal R} (x : R ⧸ I) {ε : ℝ} (hε : 0 < ε) :
    ∃ r : R, Ideal.Quotient.mk I r = x ∧ ‖r‖ < ‖x‖ + ε :=
  exists_norm_mk_lt x hε

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Quotient/Variant8ef997e842b043b9d19bee40bef6bab9c0ab14d6cb925edfcfe50a2f5c16a2e5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Quotient/Variant8ef997e842b043b9d19bee40bef6bab9c0ab14d6cb925edfcfe50a2f5c16a2e5.lean#L492).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4ecefb73a94c58895a5f894998e4e521b7ee834d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
