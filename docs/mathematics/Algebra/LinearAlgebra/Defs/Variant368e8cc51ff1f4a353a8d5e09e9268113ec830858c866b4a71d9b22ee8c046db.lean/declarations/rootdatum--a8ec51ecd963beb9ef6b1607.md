## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:62387ad8ea4f390431938cd6b3ee21f31e3de4f2d06b62ed90e9f2da8e2ab289`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 109–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev RootDatum (X₁ X₂ : Type*) [AddCommGroup X₁] [AddCommGroup X₂] := RootPairing ι ℤ X₁ X₂

/-- A root system is a root pairing for which the roots and coroots span their ambient modules.

Note that this is slightly more general than the usual definition in the sense that `N` is not
required to be the dual of `M`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Variant368e8cc51ff1f4a353a8d5e09e9268113ec830858c866b4a71d9b22ee8c046db.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Variant368e8cc51ff1f4a353a8d5e09e9268113ec830858c866b4a71d9b22ee8c046db.lean#L109).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d5c736cd86579a3d83678a08870d5b0547996ee5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
