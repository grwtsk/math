## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:32f585aa862f8d0fe798cf88058635787cac4b99225d02f5a705a58353543d75`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 558–564.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def LinearIndependent.Maximal {ι : Type w} {R : Type u} [Semiring R] {M : Type v} [AddCommMonoid M]
    [Module R M] {v : ι → M} (_i : LinearIndependent R v) : Prop :=
  ∀ (s : Set M) (_i' : LinearIndependent R ((↑) : s → M)) (_h : range v ≤ s), range v = s

/-- An alternative characterization of a maximal linearly independent family,
quantifying over types (in the same universe as `M`) into which the indexing family injects.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Variante3fd62d85f5b91bef66e31dfcfee3547cfb523a13920aa2866cd1eb28e24f537.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Variante3fd62d85f5b91bef66e31dfcfee3547cfb523a13920aa2866cd1eb28e24f537.lean#L558).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2ae3d68d4194746108d192c5bb94dadb0aa991dc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
