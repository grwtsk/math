## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:69a34860-114e-c6d6-1b49-bd1f03945ec2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 538–551.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_single_apply_aux [Mul G] (f : MonoidAlgebra k G) {r : k} {x y z : G}
    (H : ∀ a ∈ f.support, a * x = z ↔ a = y) : (f * single x r) z = f y * r := by
  classical exact
    calc
      (f * single x r) z
      _ = sum f fun a b => ite (a * x = z) (b * r) 0 :=
        (mul_apply _ _ _).trans <| Finsupp.sum_congr fun _ _ => sum_single_index (by simp)

      _ = f.sum fun a b => ite (a = y) (b * r) 0 := Finsupp.sum_congr fun x hx => by
        simp only [H _ hx]
      _ = if y ∈ f.support then f y * r else 0 := f.support.sum_ite_eq' _ _
      _ = _ := by split_ifs with h <;> simp at h <;> simp [h]


```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Variantee1506718c040dfc39038a86581f32a7b4a6512f4cc950787bccbd11f3693ff9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Variantee1506718c040dfc39038a86581f32a7b4a6512f4cc950787bccbd11f3693ff9.lean#L538).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fca5a6e3447253dcd0c6da0733a9691f235cb095` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
