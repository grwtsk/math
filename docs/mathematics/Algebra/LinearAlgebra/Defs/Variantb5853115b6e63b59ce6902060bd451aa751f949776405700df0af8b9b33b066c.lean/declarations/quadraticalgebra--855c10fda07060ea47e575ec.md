## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:077d4fd6e8c4dbe634917c983720eaf0c0e9f610d9291737c3dbb1f9d891529f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 46–59.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure QuadraticAlgebra (R : Type u) (a b : R) : Type u where
  /-- Real part of an element in quadratic algebra -/
  re : R
  /-- Imaginary part of an element in quadratic algebra -/
  im : R
deriving DecidableEq

initialize_simps_projections QuadraticAlgebra (as_prefix re, as_prefix im)

variable {R : Type*}
namespace QuadraticAlgebra

/-- The equivalence between quadratic algebra over `R` and `R × R`. -/
@[simps symm_apply]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Variantb5853115b6e63b59ce6902060bd451aa751f949776405700df0af8b9b33b066c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Variantb5853115b6e63b59ce6902060bd451aa751f949776405700df0af8b9b33b066c.lean#L46).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0339fda9732dcd85eb99b73fcc0547cf459e750d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
