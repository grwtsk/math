## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3cd7e38b3e62d0afe7738cb5e62f5a95ad7a7eadbe44c7a728c5c4f4f9054ba6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 189–197.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) CompatibleSMul.isScalarTower [SMul R' R] [IsScalarTower R' R M]
    [DistribMulAction R' N] [IsScalarTower R' R N] : CompatibleSMul R R' M N :=
  ⟨fun r m n => by
    conv_lhs => rw [← one_smul R m]
    conv_rhs => rw [← one_smul R n]
    rw [← smul_assoc, ← smul_assoc]
    exact Quotient.sound' <| AddConGen.Rel.of _ _ <| Eqv.of_smul _ _ _⟩

/-- `smul` can be moved from one side of the product to the other . -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Variant0c7ed273bc2f163ee2570cc52b8684900984b5e19f667d5d43c308f17034b73d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Variant0c7ed273bc2f163ee2570cc52b8684900984b5e19f667d5d43c308f17034b73d.lean#L189).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a277b039a0a5a31c867e2ba83b74a33a8594c648` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
