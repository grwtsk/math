## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:196da23b-9c01-80c1-01a8-b04e43703099`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–135.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Convex.combo_eq_smul_sub_add [Module R M] {x y : M} {a b : R} (h : a + b = 1) :
    a • x + b • y = b • (y - x) + x :=
  calc
    a • x + b • y = b • y - b • x + (a • x + b • x) := by rw [sub_add_add_cancel, add_comm]
    _ = b • (y - x) + x := by rw [smul_sub, Convex.combo_self h]

end AddCommGroup

-- We'll later use this to show `Module ℕ M` and `Module ℤ M` are subsingletons.
/-- A variant of `Module.ext` that's convenient for term-mode. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Variant2a0287267fab7342bff7cee2680f0bb56b1498830a577d2caa767147a292c4f8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Defs/Variant2a0287267fab7342bff7cee2680f0bb56b1498830a577d2caa767147a292c4f8.lean#L126).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee48c26a1c2d5b0eee6a9518216851b59bb6d996` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
