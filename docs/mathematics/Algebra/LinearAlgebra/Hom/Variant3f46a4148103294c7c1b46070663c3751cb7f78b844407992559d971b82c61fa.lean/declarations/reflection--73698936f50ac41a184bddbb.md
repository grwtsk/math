## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1152b8ed30f43742398ed453a5e3ca74035a1caf063aa456bd47d798c30b9c1c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 694–709.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def reflection (P : RootPairing ι R M N) (i : ι) : Aut P where
  weightMap := P.reflection i
  coweightMap := P.coreflection i
  indexEquiv := P.reflectionPerm i
  weight_coweight_transpose := by
    ext f x; simpa [reflection_apply, coreflection_apply] using mul_comm ..
  root_weightMap := by ext; simp
  coroot_coweightMap := by ext; simp
  bijective_weightMap := by
    simp only [LinearEquiv.coe_coe]
    exact LinearEquiv.bijective (P.reflection i)
  bijective_coweightMap := by
    simp only [LinearEquiv.coe_coe]
    exact LinearEquiv.bijective (P.coreflection i)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Hom/Variant3f46a4148103294c7c1b46070663c3751cb7f78b844407992559d971b82c61fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Hom/Variant3f46a4148103294c7c1b46070663c3751cb7f78b844407992559d971b82c61fa.lean#L694).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f46805e1a70c535e1959f9b4474ab99902d7a8fb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
