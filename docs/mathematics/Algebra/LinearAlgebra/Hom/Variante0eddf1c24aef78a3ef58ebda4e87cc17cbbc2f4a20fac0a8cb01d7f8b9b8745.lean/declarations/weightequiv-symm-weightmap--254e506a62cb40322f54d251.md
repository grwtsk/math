## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ebd454f4-3015-a7e9-b0af-7ec8d93b6139`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 284–288.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma weightEquiv_symm_weightMap (e : RootPairing.Equiv P Q) (m : M) :
    (weightEquiv P Q e).symm (e.toHom.weightMap m) = m :=
  (LinearEquiv.symm_apply_eq (weightEquiv P Q e)).mpr rfl

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Hom/Variante0eddf1c24aef78a3ef58ebda4e87cc17cbbc2f4a20fac0a8cb01d7f8b9b8745.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Hom/Variante0eddf1c24aef78a3ef58ebda4e87cc17cbbc2f4a20fac0a8cb01d7f8b9b8745.lean#L284).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `53eda82ed247f46be8eef33b24fef6e41378e879` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
