## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b6af98cbdeb734254bbde84df6973a348fcaf27f42fa4c37cf8cbfb442714e75`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 639–647.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def coweightHom (P : RootPairing ι R M N) : Aut P →* (N ≃ₗ[R] N)ᵐᵒᵖ where
  toFun g := MulOpposite.op (coweightEquiv g)
  map_one' := by
    simp only [MulOpposite.op_eq_one_iff]
    exact LinearEquiv.toLinearMap_inj.mp rfl
  map_mul' := by
    simp only [mul_eq_comp, coweightEquiv_comp_toLin]
    exact fun x y ↦ rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Hom/Variant55011ef7647bad1e525f38288f3c19e6b50c38c1185545c63474fd9f9c8016ce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Hom/Variant55011ef7647bad1e525f38288f3c19e6b50c38c1185545c63474fd9f9c8016ce.lean#L639).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `74980505f91545ca7a800653b57a4baacaeeff25` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
