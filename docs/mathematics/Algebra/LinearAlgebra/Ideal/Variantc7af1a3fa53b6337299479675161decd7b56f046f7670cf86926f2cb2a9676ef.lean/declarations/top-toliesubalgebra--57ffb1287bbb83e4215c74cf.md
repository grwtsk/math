## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1821bcab-1069-c883-9f3d-0b44a57a5adc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem top_toLieSubalgebra : ((⊤ : LieIdeal R L) : LieSubalgebra R L) = ⊤ :=
  rfl

@[deprecated (since := "2024-12-30")] alias top_coe_lieSubalgebra := top_toLieSubalgebra

/-- A morphism of Lie algebras `f : L → L'` pushes forward Lie ideals of `L` to Lie ideals of `L'`.

Note that unlike `LieSubmodule.map`, we must take the `lieSpan` of the image. Mathematically
this is because although `f` makes `L'` into a Lie module over `L`, in general the `L` submodules of
`L'` are not the same as the ideals of `L'`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Ideal/Variantc7af1a3fa53b6337299479675161decd7b56f046f7670cf86926f2cb2a9676ef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Ideal/Variantc7af1a3fa53b6337299479675161decd7b56f046f7670cf86926f2cb2a9676ef.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ad3931d2343e472abed14022abdd8cbff5662fd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
