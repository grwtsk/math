## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fc0fcb1218975c9841f38f7fd1f0c33bee3402ee12c026fb17f1be5a4ee25fad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 168–179.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instLoewnerPartialOrder : PartialOrder (E →ₗ[𝕜] E) where
  le f g := (g - f).IsPositive
  le_refl _ := by simp
  le_trans _ _ _ h₁ h₂ := by simpa using h₁.add h₂
  le_antisymm f₁ f₂ h₁ h₂ := by
    rw [← sub_eq_zero, ← h₂.isSymmetric.inner_map_self_eq_zero]
    intro x
    have hba2 := h₁.2 x
    rw [← neg_le_neg_iff, ← map_neg, ← inner_neg_left, ← neg_apply, neg_sub, neg_zero] at hba2
    rw [← h₂.isSymmetric.coe_re_inner_apply_self, RCLike.ofReal_eq_zero]
    exact le_antisymm hba2 (h₂.2 _)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Positive/Variant7c451eca316c4a4b315258bba9090585fffae97589b48a12c3f9df28859eedbb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Positive/Variant7c451eca316c4a4b315258bba9090585fffae97589b48a12c3f9df28859eedbb.lean#L168).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dfeea1d22145aa5e14fe4588b9aa41a4451e4753` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
