## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:52921931ca0722714028882eb794f8935373d71bdd924094df92270cd8dbc013`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 223–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [IsNoetherian R M] : IsNilpotent L (shiftedGenWeightSpace R L M χ) :=
  LieModule.isNilpotent_iff_forall'.mpr fun x ↦ isNilpotent_toEnd_sub_algebraMap M χ x

end shiftedGenWeightSpace

open shiftedGenWeightSpace in
/-- Given a Lie module `M` of a nilpotent Lie algebra `L` with coefficients in `R`,
if a function `χ : L → R` has a simultaneous generalized eigenvector for the action of `L`
then it has a simultaneous true eigenvector, provided `M` is Noetherian and has linear weights. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Linear/Variant0613dcdfa29bf5999828b500adb38c054526e3fbebc66ab23b7123284569451f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Linear/Variant0613dcdfa29bf5999828b500adb38c054526e3fbebc66ab23b7123284569451f.lean#L223).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9debbac5b58f98a22e4e6d9b72a55bf62f1c3e5d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
