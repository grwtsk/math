## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6bd07249-ab44-1817-b15c-2067d88d492d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 366–375.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma toSL2R_smul_I (z : ℍ) : z.toSL2R • I = z := by
  have : √z.im ≠ (0 : ℂ) := by simpa [Real.sqrt_ne_zero'] using z.im_pos
  ext
  suffices z.re / √z.im + √z.im * Complex.I = z * (↑√z.im)⁻¹ by
    rw [coe_specialLinearGroup_apply, div_eq_iff (mod_cast denom_ne_zero z.toSL2R I)]
    simpa [add_comm]
  rw [div_add' (hc := this), mul_right_comm, ← Complex.ofReal_mul, ← Real.sqrt_mul z.im_pos.le,
    Real.sqrt_mul_self z.im_pos.le, re_add_im, div_eq_mul_inv]

/-- `SL(2, ℝ)` acts transitively on the upper half-plane. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/MoebiusAction/Variant654604e82a8ead63f8cc53b550a1e8f80a69df417b44f2739553947a37458557.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/MoebiusAction/Variant654604e82a8ead63f8cc53b550a1e8f80a69df417b44f2739553947a37458557.lean#L366).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `39588f3c545afbf205e9750dfa3f24170e247b6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
