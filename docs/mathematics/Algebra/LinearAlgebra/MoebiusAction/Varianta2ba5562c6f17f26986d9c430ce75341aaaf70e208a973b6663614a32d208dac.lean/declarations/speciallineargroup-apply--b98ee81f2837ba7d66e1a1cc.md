## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:28548c53-96fc-aa74-4cc9-2eeaa2a745e6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 266–274.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem specialLinearGroup_apply {R : Type*} [CommRing R] [Algebra R ℝ] (g : SL(2, R)) (z : ℍ) :
    g • z = mk
      (((algebraMap R ℝ (g 0 0) : ℂ) * z + (algebraMap R ℝ (g 0 1) : ℂ)) /
      ((algebraMap R ℝ (g 1 0) : ℂ) * z + (algebraMap R ℝ (g 1 1) : ℂ)))
      (coe_specialLinearGroup_apply g z ▸ (g • z).property) := by
  ext; simp [coe_specialLinearGroup_apply]

/- these next few lemmas are *not* flagged `@simp` because of the constructors on the RHS;
instead we use the versions with coercions to `ℂ` as simp lemmas instead. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/MoebiusAction/Varianta2ba5562c6f17f26986d9c430ce75341aaaf70e208a973b6663614a32d208dac.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/MoebiusAction/Varianta2ba5562c6f17f26986d9c430ce75341aaaf70e208a973b6663614a32d208dac.lean#L266).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `22daf53a0fd50f501b9f8b554564291fc3c8fb35` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
