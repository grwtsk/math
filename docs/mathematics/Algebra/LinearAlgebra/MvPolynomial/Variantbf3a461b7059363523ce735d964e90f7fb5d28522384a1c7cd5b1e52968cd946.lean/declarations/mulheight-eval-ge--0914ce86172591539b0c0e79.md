## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3606317b-a682-7039-b100-0ff83b5f8b1a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 479–498.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem mulHeight_eval_ge' {M N : ℕ} {q : ι × ι' → MvPolynomial ι K}
    (hq : ∀ a, (q a).IsHomogeneous M) :
    ∃ C > 0, ∀ (p : ι' → MvPolynomial ι K) {x : ι → K}
      (_h : ∀ k, ∑ j, (q (k, j)).eval x * (p j).eval x = (x k) ^ (M + N)),
      C * mulHeight x ^ N ≤ mulHeight (fun j ↦ (p j).eval x) := by

  · exact ⟨1, zero_lt_one, fun p _ h ↦ by simp [mulHeight_eval_ge_aux p h]⟩
  have : 0 < Nat.card ι' := Nat.card_pos
  exact ⟨_, by positivity, mulHeight_eval_ge hq⟩

open Real in
/-- If
* `p : ι' → MvPolynomial ι K` is a family of polynomials (which in practice will be homogeneous
  of the same degree `N`),
* `q : ι × ι' → MvPolynomial ι K` is a family of homogeneous polynomials of the same degree `M`,
* `x : ι → K` is such that for all `k : ι`,
  `∑ j, (q (k, j)).eval x * (p j).eval x = (x k) ^ (M + N)`,

then the logarithmic height of `fun j ↦ (p j).eval x` is bounded below by an (explicit)
constant depending only on `q` plus `N` times the logarithmic height of `x`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/MvPolynomial/Variantbf3a461b7059363523ce735d964e90f7fb5d28522384a1c7cd5b1e52968cd946.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/MvPolynomial/Variantbf3a461b7059363523ce735d964e90f7fb5d28522384a1c7cd5b1e52968cd946.lean#L479).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4d24c1b75d0849b4cdb36995eee15e639acd6bbb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
