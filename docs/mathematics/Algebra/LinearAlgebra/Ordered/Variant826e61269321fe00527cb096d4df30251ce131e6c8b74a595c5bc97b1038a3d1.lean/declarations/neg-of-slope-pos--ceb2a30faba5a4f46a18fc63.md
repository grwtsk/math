## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:402bf296-0bf1-e2c0-ebbc-ed81a6fc6f5b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 341–345.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma neg_of_slope_pos {𝕜} [Field 𝕜] [LinearOrder 𝕜] [IsStrictOrderedRing 𝕜]
    {f : 𝕜 → 𝕜} {x₀ b : 𝕜}
    (hb : b < x₀) (hbf : 0 < slope f x₀ b) (hf : f x₀ = 0) : f b < 0 := by
  rwa [slope_pos_iff_gt, hf] at hbf
  exact hb
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Ordered/Variant826e61269321fe00527cb096d4df30251ce131e6c8b74a595c5bc97b1038a3d1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Ordered/Variant826e61269321fe00527cb096d4df30251ce131e6c8b74a595c5bc97b1038a3d1.lean#L341).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7ae9be6d754a619ef4015705b1987b47ccfe8cb1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
