## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3332a704-17a8-7c12-64de-612bbddc3fea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 268–275.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_lt_lineMap_iff_slope_lt_slope_right (h : 0 < (1 - r) * (b - a)) :
    f c < lineMap (f a) (f b) r ↔ slope f a b < slope f c b :=
  lt_iff_lt_of_le_iff_le' (lineMap_le_map_iff_slope_le_slope_right h)
    (map_le_lineMap_iff_slope_le_slope_right h)
#align map_lt_line_map_iff_slope_lt_slope_right map_lt_lineMap_iff_slope_lt_slope_right

/-- Given `c = lineMap a b r`, `c < b`, the point `(c, f c)` is strictly above the
segment `[(a, f a), (b, f b)]` if and only if `slope f c b < slope f a b`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Ordered/Variant85acc146b0f3c3f63ba85420723a5969f5d3b785d0e167e5d8044b5d9db40789.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Ordered/Variant85acc146b0f3c3f63ba85420723a5969f5d3b785d0e167e5d8044b5d9db40789.lean#L268).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `25583bc201972a10df50d9c5476a5b8591b9a121` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
