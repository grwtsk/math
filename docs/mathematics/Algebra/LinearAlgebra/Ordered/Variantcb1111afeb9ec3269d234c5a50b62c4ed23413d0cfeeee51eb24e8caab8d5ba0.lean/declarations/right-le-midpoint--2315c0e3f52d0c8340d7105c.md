## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:abb9d17d-5bf5-c776-6a96-03553bf89fe9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 165–206.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Convexity and slope

Given an interval `[a, b]` and a point `c ∈ (a, b)`, `c = lineMap a b r`, there are a few ways to
say that the point `(c, f c)` is above/below the segment `[(a, f a), (b, f b)]`:

* compare `f c` to `lineMap (f a) (f b) r`;
* compare `slope f a c` to `slope f a b`;
* compare `slope f c b` to `slope f a b`;
* compare `slope f a c` to `slope f c b`.

In this section we prove equivalence of these four approaches. In order to make the statements more
readable, we introduce local notation `c = lineMap a b r`. Then we prove lemmas like

```
lemma map_le_lineMap_iff_slope_le_slope_left (h : 0 < r * (b - a)) :
  f c ≤ lineMap (f a) (f b) r ↔ slope f a c ≤ slope f a b :=
```

For each inequality between `f c` and `lineMap (f a) (f b) r` we provide 3 lemmas:

* `*_left` relates it to an inequality on `slope f a c` and `slope f a b`;
* `*_right` relates it to an inequality on `slope f a b` and `slope f c b`;
* no-suffix version relates it to an inequality on `slope f a c` and `slope f c b`.

These inequalities can be used to restate `convexOn` in terms of monotonicity of the slope.

segment `[(a, f a), (b, f b)]` if and only if `slope f a c ≤ slope f a b`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Ordered/Variantcb1111afeb9ec3269d234c5a50b62c4ed23413d0cfeeee51eb24e8caab8d5ba0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Ordered/Variantcb1111afeb9ec3269d234c5a50b62c4ed23413d0cfeeee51eb24e8caab8d5ba0.lean#L165).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b13843c578257ca161a8c1fdd1c78cc5d30a7b9a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
