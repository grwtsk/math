## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2cd0eed9-f490-cd76-9357-6ca6c6814904`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 277–288.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem decompose_lhom_ext {N} [AddCommMonoid N] [Module R N] ⦃f g : M →ₗ[R] N⦄
    (h : ∀ i, f ∘ₗ (ℳ i).subtype = g ∘ₗ (ℳ i).subtype) : f = g :=
  LinearMap.ext <| (decomposeLinearEquiv ℳ).symm.surjective.forall.mpr <|
    suffices f ∘ₗ (decomposeLinearEquiv ℳ).symm
           = (g ∘ₗ (decomposeLinearEquiv ℳ).symm : (⨁ i, ℳ i) →ₗ[R] N) from
      DFunLike.congr_fun this
    linearMap_ext _ fun i => by
      simp_rw [LinearMap.comp_assoc, decomposeLinearEquiv_symm_comp_lof ℳ i, h]

end Module

end DirectSum
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Decomposition/Variant655357d11dae22cb95a357cf176c0f24150b3644591253a97575308d5b93a788.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Decomposition/Variant655357d11dae22cb95a357cf176c0f24150b3644591253a97575308d5b93a788.lean#L277).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `33809360dda1439aff6e2a2055a359c8df3f6f9f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
