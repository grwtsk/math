## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:911b3509-b65e-d494-5252-db9e6b92c424`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 184–201.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem AddSubmonoidClass.IsHomogeneous.mem_iff
    {P : Type*} [SetLike P M] [AddSubmonoidClass P M] (p : P)
    (hp : SetLike.IsHomogeneous ℳ p) {x} :
    x ∈ p ↔ ∀ i, (decompose ℳ x i : M) ∈ p := by
  classical
  refine ⟨fun hx i ↦ hp i hx, fun hx ↦ ?_⟩
  rw [← DirectSum.sum_support_decompose ℳ x]
  exact sum_mem (fun i _ ↦ hx i)

end AddCommMonoid

/-- The `-` in the statements below doesn't resolve without this line.

This seems to be a problem of synthesized vs inferred typeclasses disagreeing. If we replace
the statement of `decompose_neg` with `@Eq (⨁ i, ℳ i) (decompose ℳ (-x)) (-decompose ℳ x)`
instead of `decompose ℳ (-x) = -decompose ℳ x`, which forces the typeclasses needed by `⨁ i, ℳ i`
to be found by unification rather than synthesis, then everything works fine without this
instance. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Decomposition/Variantbcb5e055b96d9851c918d77d75bb2f2718edf558e83f54966b94415078ee232f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Decomposition/Variantbcb5e055b96d9851c918d77d75bb2f2718edf558e83f54966b94415078ee232f.lean#L184).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5f73e80e0bd170a6e2e882b37df581335c150a1f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
