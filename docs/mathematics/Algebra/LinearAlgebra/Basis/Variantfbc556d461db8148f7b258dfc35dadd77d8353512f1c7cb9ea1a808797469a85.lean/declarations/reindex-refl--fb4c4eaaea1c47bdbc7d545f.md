## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:519c7145-a7d4-b30e-0ac6-26f9de75972a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 143–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem reindex_refl : b.reindex (Equiv.refl _) = b :=
  ext rfl

/-- Given an affine basis for an affine space `P`, if we single out one member of the family, we
obtain a linear basis for the model space `V`.

The linear basis corresponding to the singled-out member `i : ι` is indexed by `{j : ι // j ≠ i}`
and its `j`th element is `b j -ᵥ b i`. (See `basisOf_apply`.) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basis/Variantfbc556d461db8148f7b258dfc35dadd77d8353512f1c7cb9ea1a808797469a85.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basis/Variantfbc556d461db8148f7b258dfc35dadd77d8353512f1c7cb9ea1a808797469a85.lean#L143).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `55d351642c3e9abf8f02247a0cae1fdb777ff90b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
