## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ee92b2da-21bf-4dfc-26bf-36fd23915998`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–120.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    x = ∑ i : m, ∑ j : n, single i j (x i j) := by
  ext i j
  rw [← Fintype.sum_prod_type']
  simp [single, Matrix.sum_apply, Matrix.of_apply, ← Prod.mk_inj]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basis/Variantaf32bbaf589c016edd1a7c5dffe462c01f1a677fe522cb8fe0899701eedcada5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Basis/Variantaf32bbaf589c016edd1a7c5dffe462c01f1a677fe522cb8fe0899701eedcada5.lean#L113).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
