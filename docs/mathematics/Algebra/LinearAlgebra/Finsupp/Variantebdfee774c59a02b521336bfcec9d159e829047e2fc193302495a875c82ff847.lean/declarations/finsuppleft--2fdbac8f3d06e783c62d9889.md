## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b1171c6f1bc0d16e8f9f4ec81c5313467e3f5cd96e7b5c95ec39dfab0cab8fdd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 80–86.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def finsuppLeft :
    (ι →₀ M) ⊗[R] N ≃ₗ[R] ι →₀ M ⊗[R] N :=
  congr (finsuppLEquivDirectSum R M ι) (.refl R N) ≪≫ₗ
    directSumLeft R (fun _ ↦ M) N ≪≫ₗ (finsuppLEquivDirectSum R _ ι).symm

variable {R M N ι}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Finsupp/Variantebdfee774c59a02b521336bfcec9d159e829047e2fc193302495a875c82ff847.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Finsupp/Variantebdfee774c59a02b521336bfcec9d159e829047e2fc193302495a875c82ff847.lean#L80).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `33b06cbc44bac9d5ad5368078d6fd7ac649ec5d1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
