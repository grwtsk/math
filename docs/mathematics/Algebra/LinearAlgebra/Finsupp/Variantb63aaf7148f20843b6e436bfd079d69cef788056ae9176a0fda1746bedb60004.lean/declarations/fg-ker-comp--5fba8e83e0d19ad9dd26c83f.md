## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5ccbc65c-705e-432a-9e8f-fa15fc3d5c40`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 109–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem fg_ker_comp (f : M →ₗ[R] N) (g : N →ₗ[R] P)
    (hf1 : (LinearMap.ker f).FG) (hf2 : (LinearMap.ker g).FG)
    (hsur : Function.Surjective f) : (LinearMap.ker (g.comp f)).FG := by
  rw [LinearMap.ker_comp]
  apply fg_of_fg_map_of_fg_inf_ker f
  · rwa [Submodule.map_comap_eq, LinearMap.range_eq_top.2 hsur, top_inf_eq]
  · rwa [inf_of_le_right (show (LinearMap.ker f) ≤
      (LinearMap.ker g).comap f from comap_mono bot_le)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Finsupp/Variantb63aaf7148f20843b6e436bfd079d69cef788056ae9176a0fda1746bedb60004.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Finsupp/Variantb63aaf7148f20843b6e436bfd079d69cef788056ae9176a0fda1746bedb60004.lean#L109).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d2e7aed1ee7a4e68944b7214107d1859914cac15` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
