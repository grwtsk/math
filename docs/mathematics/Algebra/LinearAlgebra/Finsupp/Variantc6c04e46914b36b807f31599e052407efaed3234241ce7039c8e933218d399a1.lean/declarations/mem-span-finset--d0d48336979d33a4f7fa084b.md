## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9394548b-d92e-f16d-ee86-67302b0a9ce2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1191–1203.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_span_finset {s : Finset M} {x : M} :
    x ∈ span R (↑s : Set M) ↔ ∃ f : M → R, ∑ i in s, f i • i = x :=
  ⟨fun hx =>
    let ⟨v, hvs, hvx⟩ :=
      (Finsupp.mem_span_image_iff_total _).1
        (show x ∈ span R (_root_.id '' (↑s : Set M)) by rwa [Set.image_id])
    ⟨v, hvx ▸ (Finsupp.total_apply_of_mem_supported _ hvs).symm⟩,
    fun ⟨f, hf⟩ => hf ▸ sum_mem fun i hi => smul_mem _ _ <| subset_span hi⟩
#align mem_span_finset mem_span_finset

/-- An element `m ∈ M` is contained in the `R`-submodule spanned by a set `s ⊆ M`, if and only if
`m` can be written as a finite `R`-linear combination of elements of `s`.
The implementation uses `Finsupp.sum`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Finsupp/Variantc6c04e46914b36b807f31599e052407efaed3234241ce7039c8e933218d399a1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Finsupp/Variantc6c04e46914b36b807f31599e052407efaed3234241ce7039c8e933218d399a1.lean#L1191).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f4fa64bfc182ac63deb8c434a3d9a268108052e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
