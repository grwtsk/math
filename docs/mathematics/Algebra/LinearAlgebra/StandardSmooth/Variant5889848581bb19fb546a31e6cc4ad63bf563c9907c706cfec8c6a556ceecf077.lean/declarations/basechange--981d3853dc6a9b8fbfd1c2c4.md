## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1eb574e3d7880ed3a70f1aca0d03882e35e2b0c5d1c023b93a141b6fc1df26b3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 535–545.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def baseChange : SubmersivePresentation T (T ⊗[R] S) where
  toPreSubmersivePresentation := P.toPreSubmersivePresentation.baseChange T
  jacobian_isUnit := P.baseChange_jacobian T ▸ P.jacobian_isUnit.map TensorProduct.includeRight
  isFinite := Presentation.baseChange_isFinite T P.toPresentation

end BaseChange

/-- Given a submersive presentation `P` and equivalences `ι ≃ P.vars` and
`κ ≃ P.rels`, this is the induced sumbersive presentation with variables indexed
by `ι` and relations indexed by `κ -/
@[simps toPreSubmersivePresentation]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/StandardSmooth/Variant5889848581bb19fb546a31e6cc4ad63bf563c9907c706cfec8c6a556ceecf077.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/StandardSmooth/Variant5889848581bb19fb546a31e6cc4ad63bf563c9907c706cfec8c6a556ceecf077.lean#L535).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `552cee4afcffc37b64dcac395ab4a4a491be616c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
