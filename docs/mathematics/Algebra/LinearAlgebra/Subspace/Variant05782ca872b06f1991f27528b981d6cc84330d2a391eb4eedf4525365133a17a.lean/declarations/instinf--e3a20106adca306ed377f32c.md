## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cd14f39545ef36dbc3675812a133bfe5a6b0968d23a4858f0ed9691dd403e122`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 124–132.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instInf : Inf (Subspace K V) :=
  ⟨fun A B =>
    ⟨A ⊓ B, fun _v _w hv hw _hvw h1 h2 =>
      ⟨A.mem_add _ _ hv hw _ h1.1 h2.1, B.mem_add _ _ hv hw _ h1.2 h2.2⟩⟩⟩
#align projectivization.subspace.has_inf Projectivization.Subspace.instInf

-- Porting note: delete the name of this instance since it causes problem since hasInf is already
-- defined above
/-- Infimums of arbitrary collections of subspaces exist. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Subspace/Variant05782ca872b06f1991f27528b981d6cc84330d2a391eb4eedf4525365133a17a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Subspace/Variant05782ca872b06f1991f27528b981d6cc84330d2a391eb4eedf4525365133a17a.lean#L124).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b47353efee5ba592621cb1d57483d6a68122ba49` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
