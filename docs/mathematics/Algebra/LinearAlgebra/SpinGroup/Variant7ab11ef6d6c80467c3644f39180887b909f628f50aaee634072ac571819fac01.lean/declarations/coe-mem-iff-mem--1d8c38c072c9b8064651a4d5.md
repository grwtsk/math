## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c5d9ca3e-7f1f-cfd0-0e29-6cbf5e37bcd0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 151–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coe_mem_iff_mem {x : (CliffordAlgebra Q)ˣ} :
    ↑x ∈ (lipschitzGroup Q).toSubmonoid.map (Units.coeHom <| CliffordAlgebra Q) ↔
    x ∈ lipschitzGroup Q := by
  simp only [Submonoid.mem_map, Subgroup.mem_toSubmonoid, Units.coeHom_apply]
  norm_cast
  exact exists_eq_right

end lipschitzGroup

/-- `pinGroup Q` is defined as the infimum of `lipschitzGroup Q` and `unitary (CliffordAlgebra Q)`.
See `mem_iff`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SpinGroup/Variant7ab11ef6d6c80467c3644f39180887b909f628f50aaee634072ac571819fac01.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SpinGroup/Variant7ab11ef6d6c80467c3644f39180887b909f628f50aaee634072ac571819fac01.lean#L151).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77524ff81775f07460c9b00e86c92ab87ab4e73e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
