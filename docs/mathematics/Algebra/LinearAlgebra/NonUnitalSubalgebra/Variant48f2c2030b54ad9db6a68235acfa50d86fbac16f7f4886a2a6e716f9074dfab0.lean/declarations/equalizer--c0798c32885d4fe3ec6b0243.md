## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2da5d3d90377eceaf494db0f491446bb58f62434b46960fa43c85e2282480dff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 521–530.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def equalizer (ϕ ψ : F) : NonUnitalSubalgebra R A where
  carrier := {a | (ϕ a : B) = ψ a}
  zero_mem' := by rw [Set.mem_setOf_eq, map_zero, map_zero]
  add_mem' {x y} (hx : ϕ x = ψ x) (hy : ϕ y = ψ y) := by
    rw [Set.mem_setOf_eq, map_add, map_add, hx, hy]
  mul_mem' {x y} (hx : ϕ x = ψ x) (hy : ϕ y = ψ y) := by
    rw [Set.mem_setOf_eq, map_mul, map_mul, hx, hy]
  smul_mem' r x (hx : ϕ x = ψ x) := by rw [Set.mem_setOf_eq, map_smul, map_smul, hx]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/NonUnitalSubalgebra/Variant48f2c2030b54ad9db6a68235acfa50d86fbac16f7f4886a2a6e716f9074dfab0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/NonUnitalSubalgebra/Variant48f2c2030b54ad9db6a68235acfa50d86fbac16f7f4886a2a6e716f9074dfab0.lean#L521).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `47e5f0a71cad883e8c7b586a095a93d8d398f581` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
