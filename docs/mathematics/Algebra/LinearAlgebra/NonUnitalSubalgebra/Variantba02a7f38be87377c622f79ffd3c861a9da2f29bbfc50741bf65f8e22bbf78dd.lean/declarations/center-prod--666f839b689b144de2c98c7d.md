## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0afc33fb-99cf-c194-0632-0f4824fed80a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1115–1125.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem center_prod {B : Type*} [NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring B] [Module R B]
    [IsScalarTower R B B] [SMulCommClass R B B] :
    center R (A × B) = prod (center R A) (center R B) :=
  SetLike.coe_injective Set.center_prod

end NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring

variable (R A : Type*) [CommSemiring R] [NonUnitalSemiring A] [Module R A] [IsScalarTower R A A]
  [SMulCommClass R A A]

-- no instance diamond, as the `npow` field isn't present in the non-unital case.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/NonUnitalSubalgebra/Variantba02a7f38be87377c622f79ffd3c861a9da2f29bbfc50741bf65f8e22bbf78dd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/NonUnitalSubalgebra/Variantba02a7f38be87377c622f79ffd3c861a9da2f29bbfc50741bf65f8e22bbf78dd.lean#L1115).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `585a20fc26ff9044fc77b4cde4884c4960695af3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
