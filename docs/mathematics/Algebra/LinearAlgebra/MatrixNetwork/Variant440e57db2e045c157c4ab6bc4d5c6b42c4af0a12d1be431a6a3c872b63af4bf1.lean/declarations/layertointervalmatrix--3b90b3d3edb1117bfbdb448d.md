## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6ad0d724bbb66e8ebfb67041b5be938c279b5377c30a22fd3e0f3c005e2462a6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 54–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def layerToIntervalMatrix (l : Layer) (exp : Int) : IntervalMatrix l.outputDim l.inputDim :=
  let intMat := rationalToIntMatrix l.outputDim l.inputDim l.weights exp
  -- For exact weights, lo = hi (point interval)
  ⟨intMat, intMat⟩

/-! ### Batch Forward Pass -/

/-- A batch of inputs represented as an IntervalMatrix.
    Each column is one input vector, rows are features.
    Shape: (input_dim, batch_size) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/MatrixNetwork/Variant440e57db2e045c157c4ab6bc4d5c6b42c4af0a12d1be431a6a3c872b63af4bf1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/MatrixNetwork/Variant440e57db2e045c157c4ab6bc4d5c6b42c4af0a12d1be431a6a3c872b63af4bf1.lean#L54).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3d8491efd05de2f0cc3c43e743df80f5d4d6d329` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
