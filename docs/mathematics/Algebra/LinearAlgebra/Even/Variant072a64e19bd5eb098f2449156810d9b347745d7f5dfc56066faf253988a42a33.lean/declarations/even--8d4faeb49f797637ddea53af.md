## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:458f37b32031a30c5be9261d6c522f58e93f16c820613d7111e7c872fd5f7681`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 93–108.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
nonrec def even.ι : EvenHom Q (even Q) where
  bilin :=
    LinearMap.mk₂ R (fun m₁ m₂ => ⟨ι Q m₁ * ι Q m₂, ι_mul_ι_mem_evenOdd_zero Q _ _⟩)
      (fun _ _ _ => by simp only [LinearMap.map_add, add_mul]; rfl)
      (fun _ _ _ => by simp only [LinearMap.map_smul, smul_mul_assoc]; rfl)
      (fun _ _ _ => by simp only [LinearMap.map_add, mul_add]; rfl) fun _ _ _ => by
      simp only [LinearMap.map_smul, mul_smul_comm]; rfl
  contract m := Subtype.ext <| ι_sq_scalar Q m
  contract_mid m₁ m₂ m₃ :=
    Subtype.ext <|
      calc
        ι Q m₁ * ι Q m₂ * (ι Q m₂ * ι Q m₃) = ι Q m₁ * (ι Q m₂ * ι Q m₂ * ι Q m₃) := by
          simp only [mul_assoc]
        _ = Q m₂ • (ι Q m₁ * ι Q m₃) := by rw [Algebra.smul_def, ι_sq_scalar, Algebra.left_comm]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Even/Variant072a64e19bd5eb098f2449156810d9b347745d7f5dfc56066faf253988a42a33.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Even/Variant072a64e19bd5eb098f2449156810d9b347745d7f5dfc56066faf253988a42a33.lean#L93).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c5e55661dfcb6486dec30c345da02fd83552f7eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
