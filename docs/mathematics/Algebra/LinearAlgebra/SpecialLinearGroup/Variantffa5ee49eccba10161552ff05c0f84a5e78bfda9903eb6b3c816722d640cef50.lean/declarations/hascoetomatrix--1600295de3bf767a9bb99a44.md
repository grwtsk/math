## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c2228c40f4ec1476791fb8f9a7ecb09c10a3fe3996311e427d0b238ac0b7b717`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 76–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance hasCoeToMatrix : Coe (SpecialLinearGroup n R) (Matrix n n R) :=
  ⟨fun A => A.val⟩

/-- In this file, Lean often has a hard time working out the values of `n` and `R` for an expression
like `det ↑A`. Rather than writing `(A : Matrix n n R)` everywhere in this file which is annoyingly
verbose, or `A.val` which is not the simp-normal form for subtypes, we create a local notation
`↑ₘA`. This notation references the local `n` and `R` variables, so is not valid as a global
notation. -/
local notation:1024 "↑ₘ" A:1024 => ((A : SpecialLinearGroup n R) : Matrix n n R)

section CoeFnInstance

/-- This instance is here for convenience, but is literally the same as the coercion from
`hasCoeToMatrix`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SpecialLinearGroup/Variantffa5ee49eccba10161552ff05c0f84a5e78bfda9903eb6b3c816722d640cef50.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SpecialLinearGroup/Variantffa5ee49eccba10161552ff05c0f84a5e78bfda9903eb6b3c816722d640cef50.lean#L76).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f0534c860f8a9514922f3c09cbaa174a3e71df29` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
