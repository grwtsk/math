## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dd5cdf7718f27b2e93663ba86d16574c430de1b782e391e8ac714389620748ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 70–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def SpecialLinearGroup :=
  { A : Matrix n n R // A.det = 1 }

end

@[inherit_doc]
scoped[MatrixGroups] notation "SL(" n ", " R ")" => Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup (Fin n) R

namespace SpecialLinearGroup

variable {n : Type u} [DecidableEq n] [Fintype n] {R : Type v} [CommRing R]

/-- If `R` and `n` have decidable equality then so does `SL(n, R)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SpecialLinearGroup/Variant599adc0a91fd1a4751e5064f8a6104be942c11270d2029449440851e1018e2aa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SpecialLinearGroup/Variant599adc0a91fd1a4751e5064f8a6104be942c11270d2029449440851e1018e2aa.lean#L70).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d914df37d8f5cc56decaa61e4c4d66345ce4c4a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
