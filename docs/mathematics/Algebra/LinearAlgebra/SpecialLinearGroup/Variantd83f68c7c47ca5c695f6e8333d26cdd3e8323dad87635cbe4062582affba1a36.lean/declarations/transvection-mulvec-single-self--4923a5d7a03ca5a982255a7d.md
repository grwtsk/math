## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ceb22a96-08e1-04de-7229-3c68efed91c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 526–531.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma transvection_mulVec_single_self {i j : ι} (hij : i ≠ j) (b : F) :
    (transvection hij b).1 *ᵥ (Pi.single i (1 : F)) = Pi.single i 1 := by
  rw [transvection_coe]
  simp [-mulVec_single, add_mulVec, single_mulVec_eq, hij]

/-- The transvection `transvection i j hij b` acts on `e_j = Pi.single j 1` by adding `b·e_i`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SpecialLinearGroup/Variantd83f68c7c47ca5c695f6e8333d26cdd3e8323dad87635cbe4062582affba1a36.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/SpecialLinearGroup/Variantd83f68c7c47ca5c695f6e8333d26cdd3e8323dad87635cbe4062582affba1a36.lean#L526).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2336b1615bef41d2a93efe72389be2b1f6172533` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
