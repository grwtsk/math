## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8f85f12bab3a16be93dd1fd90e5ffc72956fe3883fb6d884c5f7dced99cad2cc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 175–186.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance perfectClosure.perfectRing (p : ℕ) [ExpChar E p]
    [PerfectRing E p] : PerfectRing (perfectClosure F E) p := .ofSurjective _ p fun x ↦ by
  haveI := RingHom.expChar _ (algebraMap F E).injective p
  obtain ⟨x', hx⟩ := surjective_frobenius E p x.1
  obtain ⟨n, y, hy⟩ := (mem_perfectClosure_iff_pow_mem p).1 x.2
  rw [frobenius_def] at hx
  rw [← hx, ← pow_mul, ← pow_succ'] at hy
  exact ⟨⟨x', (mem_perfectClosure_iff_pow_mem p).2 ⟨n + 1, y, hy⟩⟩, by
    simp_rw [frobenius_def, SubmonoidClass.mk_pow, hx]⟩

/-- If `E` is a perfect field, then the (relative) perfect closure
`perfectClosure F E` is perfect. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PerfectClosure/Variant93df8f31ac1f25885dbedde377cb74592675a2a39ee48b25c45c9493f88ac1f4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PerfectClosure/Variant93df8f31ac1f25885dbedde377cb74592675a2a39ee48b25c45c9493f88ac1f4.lean#L175).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3166de4a719f136cdbed6671d899571828a3ebee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
