## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:224d7807c4f010cda12e90bc80d6ca8921fd126d13b873a719a4fb34040389b0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 165–189.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance ExtensionOf.inhabited : Inhabited (ExtensionOf i f) where
  default :=
    { domain := LinearMap.range i
      toFun :=
        { toFun := fun x => f x.2.choose
          map_add' := fun x y => by
            have eq1 : _ + _ = (x + y).1 := congr_arg₂ (· + ·) x.2.choose_spec y.2.choose_spec
            rw [← map_add, ← (x + y).2.choose_spec] at eq1
            dsimp
            rw [← Fact.out (p := Function.Injective i) eq1, map_add]
          map_smul' := fun r x => by
            have eq1 : r • _ = (r • x).1 := congr_arg (r • ·) x.2.choose_spec
            rw [← LinearMap.map_smul, ← (r • x).2.choose_spec] at eq1
            dsimp
            rw [← Fact.out (p := Function.Injective i) eq1, LinearMap.map_smul] }
      le := le_refl _
      is_extension := fun m => by
        simp only [LinearPMap.mk_apply, LinearMap.coe_mk]
        dsimp
        apply congrArg
        exact Fact.out (p := Function.Injective i)
          (⟨i m, ⟨_, rfl⟩⟩ : LinearMap.range i).2.choose_spec.symm }

/-- Since every nonempty chain has a maximal element, by Zorn's lemma, there is a maximal
`extension_of i f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Injective/Variant268f522fbb06913c1970a4ec9fa72b159ae84f8677eee5b1698f71f9c31afec7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Injective/Variant268f522fbb06913c1970a4ec9fa72b159ae84f8677eee5b1698f71f9c31afec7.lean#L165).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f88c6644b005dd9b8150cf6ea8208dd49813d1a8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
