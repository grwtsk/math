## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:be12630b9697b8e8653115f5efd938cf4943e64b229816d2d5428c380bb4d2ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–130.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Min (ExtensionOf i f) where
  min X1 X2 :=
    { X1.toLinearPMap ⊓ X2.toLinearPMap with
      le := fun x hx =>
        (by
          rcases hx with ⟨x, rfl⟩
          refine ⟨X1.le (Set.mem_range_self _), X2.le (Set.mem_range_self _), ?_⟩
          rw [← X1.is_extension x, ← X2.is_extension x] :
          x ∈ X1.toLinearPMap.eqLocus X2.toLinearPMap)
      is_extension := fun _ => X1.is_extension _ }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Injective/Variant79529cf8e1d703f95fefb7cc389349cf0b4c99d58203496e88b1e5828b1a2845.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Injective/Variant79529cf8e1d703f95fefb7cc389349cf0b4c99d58203496e88b1e5828b1a2845.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3943d6270547bd31383d57006031212950940e70` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
