## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:adb36eca-7085-c9f8-9a51-0e0a4a92f10a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 513–521.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem delta_relations :
    deltaV ^ 2 = a₁ ^ 2 * deltaV ∧
      deltaU ^ 2 = a₁ * b₁ * deltaU - b₁ ^ 2 * deltaV := by
  obtain ⟨ha₁, hb₁, hab₁, hv₁', hu₁'⟩ := mapped_relations (S := A ⊗[R] A) left
  obtain ⟨_, _, _, hv₂', hu₂'⟩ := mapped_relations (S := A ⊗[R] A) right
  simp only [right_aA, right_bA] at hv₂' hu₂'
  exact law_relations_generic ha₁ hb₁ hab₁ hv₁' hu₁' hv₂' hu₂'

/-- The proof that `δ_λ := (1+aδ_U)(1+bδ_V) = λ ⊗ₜ λ` in `A ⊗ A`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/GrothendieckPower/Variantb86a236608dc19f2f20589efd41ffc4760291589b484f48ad94386268ce17892.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/GrothendieckPower/Variantb86a236608dc19f2f20589efd41ffc4760291589b484f48ad94386268ce17892.lean#L513).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9c52a1085984477c11991a40854fffc0e35111ef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
