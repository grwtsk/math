## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a1839a74-cb5e-5c99-309c-4a74ee34ab83`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–77.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private lemma chainLength_aux (hα : α.IsNonZero) {x} (hx : x ∈ rootSpace H (chainTop α β)) :
    ∃ n : ℕ, n • x = ⁅coroot α, x⁆ := by
  by_cases hx' : x = 0
  · exact ⟨0, by simp [hx']⟩
  obtain ⟨h, e, f, isSl2, he, hf⟩ := exists_isSl2Triple_of_weight_isNonZero hα
  obtain rfl := isSl2.h_eq_coroot hα he hf
  have : isSl2.HasPrimitiveVectorWith x (chainTop α β (coroot α)) :=
    have := lie_mem_genWeightSpace_of_mem_genWeightSpace he hx
    ⟨hx', by rw [← lie_eq_smul_of_mem_rootSpace hx]; rfl,
      by rwa [genWeightSpace_add_chainTop α β hα] at this⟩
  obtain ⟨μ, hμ⟩ := this.exists_nat
  exact ⟨μ, by rw [← Nat.cast_smul_eq_nsmul K, ← hμ, lie_eq_smul_of_mem_rootSpace hx]⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/Variant141be98823a1bc838f7eee856505f6df9feb7b1e599f7236d82edf10164ac616.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/Variant141be98823a1bc838f7eee856505f6df9feb7b1e599f7236d82edf10164ac616.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `991560bcbd90b9229f41921d33e1418b0b3c1a11` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
