## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9d4f0a41-e51e-2cff-eadf-367abd3cacfc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 105–112.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsHermitian.fromBlocks {A : Matrix m m α} {B : Matrix m n α} {C : Matrix n m α}
    {D : Matrix n n α} (hA : A.IsHermitian) (hBC : Bᴴ = C) (hD : D.IsHermitian) :
    (A.fromBlocks B C D).IsHermitian := by
  have hCB : Cᴴ = B := by rw [← hBC, conjTranspose_conjTranspose]
  unfold Matrix.IsHermitian
  rw [fromBlocks_conjTranspose, hBC, hCB, hA, hD]

/-- This is the `iff` version of `Matrix.IsHermitian.fromBlocks`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Hermitian/Variant95bed55fc85d671a36690be8cda4a30e04dad60d39fd4e24a2c8cf21f1351c2b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Hermitian/Variant95bed55fc85d671a36690be8cda4a30e04dad60d39fd4e24a2c8cf21f1351c2b.lean#L105).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d4bb233827d8193d97553501617e0e0402a53377` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
