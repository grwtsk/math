## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:22fd8f8e-8bb1-afe9-fbce-0addfd5d80ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 42–54.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem involutionCompressionGram_transpose
    {k N : ℕ}
    (A : Matrix (Fin k) (Fin N) ℝ)
    (J : Matrix (Fin N) (Fin N) ℝ)
    (hJ : J.transpose = J) :
    (involutionCompressionGram A J).transpose =
      involutionCompressionGram A J := by
  unfold involutionCompressionGram
  rw [Matrix.transpose_mul, Matrix.transpose_mul, hJ,
    Matrix.transpose_transpose]
  rw [Matrix.mul_assoc]

/-- Left row-basis change acts by congruence on the compression. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Grassmannian/Variant19a0dee46be277a0721259ae5a1ca3b888521d50adecbed99ddabf996d38d165.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Grassmannian/Variant19a0dee46be277a0721259ae5a1ca3b888521d50adecbed99ddabf996d38d165.lean#L42).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f5265ed3c5047303360d7c3ad8fb9389fc865ab0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
