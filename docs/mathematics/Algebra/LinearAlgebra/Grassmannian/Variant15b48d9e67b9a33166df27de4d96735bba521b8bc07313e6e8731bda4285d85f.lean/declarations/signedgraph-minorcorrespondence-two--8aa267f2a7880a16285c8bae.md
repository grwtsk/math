## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a024941f-0f9c-076d-a411-0ceb69c3ba7c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 125–129.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem signedGraph_minorCorrespondence_two (M : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ) :
    Toeplitz.FiniteNonnegative M ↔ AllOrderedMinorsNonneg (SignedGraph.frame M) := by
  rw [signedGraph_two_eq_chart, squareChart24_nonnegative_iff, finiteNonnegative_two_iff]

/-- The rank-two Toeplitz block lands in the nonnegative boundary, not the positive interior. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Grassmannian/Variant15b48d9e67b9a33166df27de4d96735bba521b8bc07313e6e8731bda4285d85f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Grassmannian/Variant15b48d9e67b9a33166df27de4d96735bba521b8bc07313e6e8731bda4285d85f.lean#L125).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `508418463704a47a9302713d79259c9594e13820` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
