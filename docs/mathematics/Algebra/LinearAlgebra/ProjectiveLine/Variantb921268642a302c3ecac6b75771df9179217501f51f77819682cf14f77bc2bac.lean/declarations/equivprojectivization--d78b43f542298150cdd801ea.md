## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3d360840f69477ffd05621b41df456a38c61d1feac975a265356e7c769e8ccad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 84–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def equivProjectivization : OnePoint K ≃ ℙ K (Fin 2 → K) where
  toFun p := p.elim (mk K ![1, 0] (by simp)) (fun t ↦ mk K ![t, 1] (by simp))
  invFun p := by
    refine Projectivization.lift
      (fun u : {v : Fin 2 → K // v ≠ 0} ↦ if u.1 1 = 0 then ∞ else ((u.1 1)⁻¹ * u.1 0)) ?_ p
    rintro ⟨-, hv⟩ ⟨w, hw⟩ t rfl
    have ht : t ≠ 0 := by rintro rfl; simp at hv
    by_cases h₀ : w 1 = 0 <;> simp [h₀, ht, mul_assoc]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ProjectiveLine/Variantb921268642a302c3ecac6b75771df9179217501f51f77819682cf14f77bc2bac.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ProjectiveLine/Variantb921268642a302c3ecac6b75771df9179217501f51f77819682cf14f77bc2bac.lean#L84).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9dc5f93d2210f8b4e9c823f8c7bd706377d32100` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
