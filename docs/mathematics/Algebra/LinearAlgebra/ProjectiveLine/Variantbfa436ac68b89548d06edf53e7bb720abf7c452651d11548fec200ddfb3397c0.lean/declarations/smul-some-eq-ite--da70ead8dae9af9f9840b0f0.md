## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:87da319d-feea-68ff-25e7-94e9c4e4cbec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 157–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma smul_some_eq_ite {g : GL (Fin 2) K} {k : K} :
    g • (k : OnePoint K) =
      if g 1 0 * k + g 1 1 = 0 then ∞ else (g 0 0 * k + g 0 1) / (g 1 0 * k + g 1 1) := by
  simp [Equiv.smul_def, mulVec_eq_sum, div_eq_inv_mul, mul_comm, Units.smul_def]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ProjectiveLine/Variantbfa436ac68b89548d06edf53e7bb720abf7c452651d11548fec200ddfb3397c0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/ProjectiveLine/Variantbfa436ac68b89548d06edf53e7bb720abf7c452651d11548fec200ddfb3397c0.lean#L157).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3b6b1d34ffbea42a37c44720751aac367be4b5e0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
