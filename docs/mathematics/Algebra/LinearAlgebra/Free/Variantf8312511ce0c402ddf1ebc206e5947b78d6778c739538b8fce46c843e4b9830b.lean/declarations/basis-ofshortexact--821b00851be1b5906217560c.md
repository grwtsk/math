## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8c3c2f8574b4aa438c1bdf26520a02fc9dcf8ae39bb5c762cfc870f4f7ae862e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 161–166.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Basis.ofShortExact {M : ModuleCat R} {f : N ⟶ M} {g : M ⟶ P} (h : ShortExact f g)
    (bN : Basis ι R N) (bP : Basis ι' R P) : Basis (ι ⊕ ι') R M :=
  Basis.mk (linearIndependent_shortExact bN.linearIndependent bP.linearIndependent h)
    (span_rightExact (le_of_eq (bN.span_eq.symm)) (le_of_eq (bP.span_eq.symm)) h.epi h.exact)

/-- In a short exact sequence `0 ⟶ N ⟶ M ⟶ P ⟶ 0`, if `N` and `P` are free, then `M` is free.-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Free/Variantf8312511ce0c402ddf1ebc206e5947b78d6778c739538b8fce46c843e4b9830b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Free/Variantf8312511ce0c402ddf1ebc206e5947b78d6778c739538b8fce46c843e4b9830b.lean#L161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b465b68e89b4fcf008b0eedc59e97bd13d4af56d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
