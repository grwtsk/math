## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7787c3fd-f647-387d-2f90-c58cec45d581`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 48–61.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lift_rank_mul_lift_rank :
    Cardinal.lift.{w} (Module.rank F K) * Cardinal.lift.{v} (Module.rank K A) =
      Cardinal.lift.{v} (Module.rank F A) := by
  let b := Module.Free.chooseBasis F K
  let c := Module.Free.chooseBasis K A
  rw [← (Module.rank F K).lift_id, ← b.mk_eq_rank, ← (Module.rank K A).lift_id, ← c.mk_eq_rank,
    ← lift_umax.{w, v}, ← (b.smulTower c).mk_eq_rank, mk_prod, lift_mul, lift_lift, lift_lift,
    lift_lift, lift_lift, lift_umax.{v, w}]

/-- Tower law: if `A` is a `K`-module and `K` is an extension of `F` then
$\operatorname{rank}_F(A) = \operatorname{rank}_F(K) * \operatorname{rank}_K(A)$.

This is a simpler version of `lift_rank_mul_lift_rank` with `K` and `A` in the same universe. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Free/Variant45a535523618f6e16aff292c4bbf50fe4f3a8f1e85b51440df79480d4aa36c18.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Free/Variant45a535523618f6e16aff292c4bbf50fe4f3a8f1e85b51440df79480d4aa36c18.lean#L48).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `25fbad12676c25da82f083b8bb319fc746a6bfdf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
