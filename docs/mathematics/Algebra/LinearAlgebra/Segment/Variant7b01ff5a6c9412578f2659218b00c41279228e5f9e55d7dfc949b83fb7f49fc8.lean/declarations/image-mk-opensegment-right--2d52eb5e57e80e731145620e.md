## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:18aa3980-bd63-1972-aeb7-dba8fab9f5e7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 665–676.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem image_mk_openSegment_right (x : E) (y₁ y₂ : F) :
    (fun y => (x, y)) '' openSegment 𝕜 y₁ y₂ = openSegment 𝕜 (x, y₁) (x, y₂) := by
  rw [openSegment_eq_image₂, openSegment_eq_image₂, image_image]
  refine EqOn.image_eq fun a ha ↦ ?_
  simp [Convex.combo_self ha.2.2]

end Prod

namespace Pi

variable [Semiring 𝕜] [PartialOrder 𝕜] [∀ i, AddCommMonoid (M i)] [∀ i, Module 𝕜 (M i)] {s : Set ι}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Segment/Variant7b01ff5a6c9412578f2659218b00c41279228e5f9e55d7dfc949b83fb7f49fc8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Segment/Variant7b01ff5a6c9412578f2659218b00c41279228e5f9e55d7dfc949b83fb7f49fc8.lean#L665).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c3cd6f15e4a6495ed88f5ade1b22f0864187137` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
