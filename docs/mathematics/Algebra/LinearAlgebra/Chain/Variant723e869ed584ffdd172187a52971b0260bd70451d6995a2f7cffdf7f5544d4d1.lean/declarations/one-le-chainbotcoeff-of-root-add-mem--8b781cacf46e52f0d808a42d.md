## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:758f7b72-6439-8c0e-ea2d-9306349a1c73`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–193.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma one_le_chainBotCoeff_of_root_add_mem [P.IsReduced] (h : P.root i - P.root j ∈ range P.root) :
    1 ≤ P.chainBotCoeff i j := by
  have h' := P.linearIndependent_of_sub_mem_range_root' h
  rwa [← root_sub_nsmul_mem_range_iff_le_chainBotCoeff h', one_smul, ← neg_mem_range_root_iff,
    neg_sub]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Chain/Variant723e869ed584ffdd172187a52971b0260bd70451d6995a2f7cffdf7f5544d4d1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Chain/Variant723e869ed584ffdd172187a52971b0260bd70451d6995a2f7cffdf7f5544d4d1.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6d9b566699b6f060d451937da1f5cb9c5f61f25d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
