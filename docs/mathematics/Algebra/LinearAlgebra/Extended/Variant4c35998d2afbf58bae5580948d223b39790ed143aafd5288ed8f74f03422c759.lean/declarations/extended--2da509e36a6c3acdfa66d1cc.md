## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:793e9fde58a8a35cffea5406a5a953c8451389d78ed67a311d9a576de6b6f223`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 51–65.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def extended (I : FractionalIdeal M K) : FractionalIdeal N L where
  val := span B <| (IsLocalization.map (S := K) L f hf) '' I
  property := by
    have ⟨a, ha, frac⟩ := I.isFractional
    refine ⟨f a, hf ha, fun b hb ↦ ?_⟩
    refine span_induction (fun x hx ↦ ?_) ⟨0, by simp⟩
      (fun x y _ _ hx hy ↦ smul_add (f a) x y ▸ isInteger_add hx hy) (fun b c _ hc ↦ ?_) hb
    · rcases hx with ⟨k, kI, rfl⟩
      obtain ⟨c, hc⟩ := frac k kI
      exact ⟨f c, by simp [← IsLocalization.map_smul, ← hc]⟩
    · rw [← smul_assoc, smul_eq_mul, mul_comm (f a), ← smul_eq_mul, smul_assoc]
      exact isInteger_smul hc

local notation "map_f" => (IsLocalization.map (S := K) L f hf)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Extended/Variant4c35998d2afbf58bae5580948d223b39790ed143aafd5288ed8f74f03422c759.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Extended/Variant4c35998d2afbf58bae5580948d223b39790ed143aafd5288ed8f74f03422c759.lean#L51).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `123bb0fef887f6023431c0b0933e2776ce790281` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
