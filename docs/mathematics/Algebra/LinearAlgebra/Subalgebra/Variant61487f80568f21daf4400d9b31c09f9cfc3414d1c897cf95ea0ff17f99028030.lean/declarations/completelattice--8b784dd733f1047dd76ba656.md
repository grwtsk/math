## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:16b84016405ecb6d3c3dd283076bc23c9f2c2f8234fa7ea494b9b772e9c0b73c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 484–497.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance completeLattice : CompleteLattice (LieSubalgebra R L) :=
  { completeLatticeOfInf _ sInf_glb with
    bot := ⊥
    bot_le := fun N _ h ↦ by
      rw [mem_bot] at h
      rw [h]
      exact N.zero_mem'
    top := ⊤
    le_top := fun _ _ _ ↦ trivial
    inf := (· ⊓ ·)
    le_inf := fun _ _ _ h₁₂ h₁₃ _ hm ↦ ⟨h₁₂ hm, h₁₃ hm⟩
    inf_le_left := fun _ _ _ ↦ And.left
    inf_le_right := fun _ _ _ ↦ And.right }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Subalgebra/Variant61487f80568f21daf4400d9b31c09f9cfc3414d1c897cf95ea0ff17f99028030.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Subalgebra/Variant61487f80568f21daf4400d9b31c09f9cfc3414d1c897cf95ea0ff17f99028030.lean#L484).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `515b576ec709f978ebf32e85229a3b9fbaa15ff7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
