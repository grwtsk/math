## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a32e82178054b457c602a8ffe9a1961cd73cca2b745cb181af66dd8691a3f13b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 309–316.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def range : LieSubalgebra R L₂ :=
  { LinearMap.range (f : L →ₗ[R] L₂) with
      lie_mem' := by
        rintro - - ⟨x, rfl⟩ ⟨y, rfl⟩
        exact ⟨⁅x, y⁆, f.map_lie x y⟩ }
#align lie_hom.range LieHom.range

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Subalgebra/Variant86505facb9a052301f4e801402c26659b9196ed5015d1952e3ebf4336490b07f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Subalgebra/Variant86505facb9a052301f4e801402c26659b9196ed5015d1952e3ebf4336490b07f.lean#L309).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7b67c5b42b2c264e74c8b6d0194b314ea5df66ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
