## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7d19fbd5-bdc5-1274-26b6-9d4cd9c1fbf3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–96.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lTensorBot_symm_apply (a : A) : A.lTensorBot.symm a = 1 ⊗ₜ[R] a := rfl

variable (A) in
/-- If `A` is a subalgebra of `S/R`, there is the natural `R`-algebra isomorphism between
`A ⊗[R] i(R)` and `A` induced by multiplication in `S`, here `i : R → S` is the structure map.
This generalizes `Algebra.TensorProduct.rid` as `i(R)` is not necessarily isomorphic to `R`.

This is the `Subalgebra` version of `Submodule.rTensorOne` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Subalgebra/Variantc46aedda9189fe3fca0a7748b1026017525ff73cdc6f41266224a8bc9ee64783.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Subalgebra/Variantc46aedda9189fe3fca0a7748b1026017525ff73cdc6f41266224a8bc9ee64783.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc74da92bcc1479fe0c7c4843e837133f2bce00c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
