## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:37d3d75e5ce9076e50f100126074f27106bc8bc6106197516b950380675b899e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–102.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def FiniteDimensional (K V : Type*) [DivisionRing K] [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V] :=
  Module.Finite K V
#align finite_dimensional FiniteDimensional

variable {K : Type u} {V : Type v}

namespace FiniteDimensional

open IsNoetherian

section DivisionRing

variable [DivisionRing K] [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V] {V₂ : Type v'} [AddCommGroup V₂]
  [Module K V₂]

/-- If the codomain of an injective linear map is finite dimensional, the domain must be as well. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/FiniteDimensional/Variant764f7ca13a498ae399b0f9a75f72d00dad3fda448aa0071c6cd0ecc54da95942.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/FiniteDimensional/Variant764f7ca13a498ae399b0f9a75f72d00dad3fda448aa0071c6cd0ecc54da95942.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a9bd4711528e02e48be1c10bb6d7a39467adff0e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
