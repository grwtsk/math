## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:083663fbc210caccb4c9232aa55f998da4f439844cb2edc2e9ca010bbbbb1650`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 366–383.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def lequivProdDirectSum : (⨁ i, α i) ≃ₗ[R] α none × ⨁ i, α (some i) :=
  { addEquivProdDirectSum with map_smul' := DFinsupp.equivProdDFinsupp_smul }

end Option

end General

section Submodule

section Semiring

variable {R : Type u} [Semiring R]
variable {ι : Type v} [dec_ι : DecidableEq ι]
variable {M : Type*} [AddCommMonoid M] [Module R M]
variable (A : ι → Submodule R M)

/-- The canonical linear map from `⨁ i, A i` to `M` where `A` is a collection of `Submodule R M`
indexed by `ι`. This is `DirectSum.coeAddMonoidHom` as a `LinearMap`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Module/Variant1a0b599caf7102f8f23e79cddbc08a8c8af2baa44a68926b1b29dc43177ba8cd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Module/Variant1a0b599caf7102f8f23e79cddbc08a8c8af2baa44a68926b1b29dc43177ba8cd.lean#L366).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e9305f907f30b0396e1c2129f0bcac926d2c84b2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
