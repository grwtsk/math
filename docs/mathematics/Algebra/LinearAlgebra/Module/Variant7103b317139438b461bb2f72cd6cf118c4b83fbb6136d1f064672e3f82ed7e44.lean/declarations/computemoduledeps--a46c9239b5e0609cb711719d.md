## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c72f297abe9b9e22414ef448abc7fdc7354345297781e68edd076d8f1f991d39`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 203–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def computeModuleDeps
  (impLibs : Array Dynlib) (externLibs : Array Dynlib)
  (dynlibs : Array Dynlib) (plugins : Array Dynlib)
: FetchM ModuleDeps := do
  /-
  Requirements:
  * Lean wants the external library symbols before module symbols.
  * Unix requires the file extension of the dynlib.
  * For some reason, building from the Lean server requires full paths.
    Everything else loads fine with just the augmented library path.
  * Linux needs the augmented path to resolve nested dependencies in dynlibs.
  -/
  let impLibs ← mkLoadOrder impLibs
  let mut dynlibs := externLibs ++ dynlibs
  let mut plugins := plugins
  for impLib in impLibs do
    if impLib.plugin then
      plugins := plugins.push impLib
    else
      dynlibs := dynlibs.push impLib
  /-
  On MacOS, Lake must be loaded as a plugin for
  `import Lake` to work with precompiled modules.

  -/
  if Platform.isOSX && !(plugins.isEmpty && dynlibs.isEmpty) then
    plugins := plugins.push (← getLakeInstall).sharedDynlib
  return {dynlibs, plugins}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Module/Variant7103b317139438b461bb2f72cd6cf118c4b83fbb6136d1f064672e3f82ed7e44.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Module/Variant7103b317139438b461bb2f72cd6cf118c4b83fbb6136d1f064672e3f82ed7e44.lean#L203).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3e86af6463090dc2137ba05b5b4fed84e5d42a26` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
