## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a4b9c869-7145-ce20-6599-897534b0aa42`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 229–241.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem hasBasis_nhds_zero [TopologicalSpace F] [TopologicalAddGroup F] :
    (𝓝 (0 : E →SL[σ] F)).HasBasis
      (fun SV : Set E × Set F => Bornology.IsVonNBounded 𝕜₁ SV.1 ∧ SV.2 ∈ (𝓝 0 : Filter F))

variable (G) [TopologicalSpace F] [TopologicalSpace G]

/-- Pre-composition by a *fixed* continuous linear map as a continuous linear map.
Note that in non-normed space it is not always true that composition is continuous
in both variables, so we have to fix one of them. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/StrongTopology/Variantd5c2fbc314999255bd05085b7d25684aa28669d747de8b37e815cfd1b1224408.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/StrongTopology/Variantd5c2fbc314999255bd05085b7d25684aa28669d747de8b37e815cfd1b1224408.lean#L229).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0139c7c777be6bb6a8511e36060a9aaa87935acf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
