## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:96df681e-9e96-4200-dd6c-e14d091655af`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 122–128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma egauge_le_of_smul_mem_of_ne (h : c • x ∈ s) (hc : c ≠ 0) : egauge 𝕜 s x ≤ (‖c‖₊⁻¹ : ℝ≥0) := by
  rw [← nnnorm_inv]
  exact egauge_le_of_mem_smul <| (mem_inv_smul_set_iff₀ hc _ _).2 h

/-- If `c • x ∈ s`, then `egauge 𝕜 s x` is at most `‖c‖ₑ⁻¹`.

See also `egauge_le_of_smul_mem_of_ne`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/EGauge/Variantdb5ed0a50b4b2985e5de04186172fc08a0a38c04be109fba34313b521b11f55e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/EGauge/Variantdb5ed0a50b4b2985e5de04186172fc08a0a38c04be109fba34313b521b11f55e.lean#L122).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4918e1ce2676bfecc624d20526170ea2c68ff855` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
