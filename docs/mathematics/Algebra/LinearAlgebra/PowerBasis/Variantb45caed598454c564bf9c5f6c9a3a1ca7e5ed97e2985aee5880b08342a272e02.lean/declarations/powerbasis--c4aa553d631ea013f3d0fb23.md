## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8a47a2b3dd19a6904c12610918a977e862de2f4764ab39f941e8dd465cb8bd39`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure PowerBasis (R S : Type*) [CommRing R] [Ring S] [Algebra R S] where
  gen : S
  dim : ℕ
  basis : Basis (Fin dim) R S
  basis_eq_pow : ∀ (i), basis i = gen ^ (i : ℕ)

-- this is usually not needed because of `basis_eq_pow` but can be needed in some cases;
-- in such circumstances, add it manually using `@[simps dim gen basis]`.
initialize_simps_projections PowerBasis (-basis)

namespace PowerBasis

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PowerBasis/Variantb45caed598454c564bf9c5f6c9a3a1ca7e5ed97e2985aee5880b08342a272e02.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/PowerBasis/Variantb45caed598454c564bf9c5f6c9a3a1ca7e5ed97e2985aee5880b08342a272e02.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1d8fe1ee88000145e685c8910639e0b89511368` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
