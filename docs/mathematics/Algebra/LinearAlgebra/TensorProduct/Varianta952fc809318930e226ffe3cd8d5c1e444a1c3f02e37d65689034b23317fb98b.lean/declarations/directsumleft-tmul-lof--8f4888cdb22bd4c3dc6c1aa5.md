## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:893e3b70-eea8-45c2-2455-6cd915508a2b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 167–175.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem directSumLeft_tmul_lof (i : ι₁) (x : M₁ i) (y : M₂') :
    directSumLeft R M₁ M₂' (DirectSum.lof R _ _ i x ⊗ₜ[R] y) =
    DirectSum.lof R _ _ i (x ⊗ₜ[R] y) := by
  dsimp only [directSumLeft, LinearEquiv.ofLinear_apply, lift.tmul]
  rw [DirectSum.toModule_lof R i]
  rfl
#align tensor_product.direct_sum_left_tmul_lof TensorProduct.directSumLeft_tmul_lof

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/TensorProduct/Varianta952fc809318930e226ffe3cd8d5c1e444a1c3f02e37d65689034b23317fb98b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/TensorProduct/Varianta952fc809318930e226ffe3cd8d5c1e444a1c3f02e37d65689034b23317fb98b.lean#L167).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `690484c2b1f9159b84897de6fd7694db5b4b3a6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
