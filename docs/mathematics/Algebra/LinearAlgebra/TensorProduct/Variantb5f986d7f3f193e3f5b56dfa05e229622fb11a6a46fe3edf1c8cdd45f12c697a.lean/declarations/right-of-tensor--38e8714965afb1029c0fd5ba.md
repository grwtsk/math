## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9d16a1ae-7b5e-bff9-32ea-b81b088eca26`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 74–80.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma right_of_tensor (inj : Function.Injective (algebraMap K B)) [Module.Flat K C]
    [Algebra.IsCentral K (B ⊗[K] C)] : IsCentral K C :=
  have : IsCentral K (C ⊗[K] B) := IsCentral.of_algEquiv K _ _ <| Algebra.TensorProduct.comm _ _ _
  left_of_tensor K C B inj

/-- Let `B` and `C` be two algebras over a field `K`, if `B ⊗[K] C` is central and `C` is
  non-trivial, then `B` is central. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/TensorProduct/Variantb5f986d7f3f193e3f5b56dfa05e229622fb11a6a46fe3edf1c8cdd45f12c697a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/TensorProduct/Variantb5f986d7f3f193e3f5b56dfa05e229622fb11a6a46fe3edf1c8cdd45f12c697a.lean#L74).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `13f140d600ea138ff12a225b98d92d0c12d8424a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
