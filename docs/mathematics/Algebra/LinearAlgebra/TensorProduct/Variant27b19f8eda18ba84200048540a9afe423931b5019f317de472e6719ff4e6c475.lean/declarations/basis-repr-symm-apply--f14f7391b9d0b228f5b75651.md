## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4ec78cf1-bc73-7899-4f9a-aba14f18de31`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 915–921.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem basis_repr_symm_apply (r : R) (i : ι) :
    (basis R b).repr.symm (Finsupp.single i r) = r ⊗ₜ b.repr.symm (Finsupp.single i 1) := by
  rw [basis, LinearEquiv.coe_symm_mk] -- porting note: `coe_symm_mk` isn't firing in `simp`
  simp [Equiv.uniqueProd_symm_apply, basisAux]

-- Porting note: simpNF linter failed on `basis_repr_symm_apply`
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/TensorProduct/Variant27b19f8eda18ba84200048540a9afe423931b5019f317de472e6719ff4e6c475.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/TensorProduct/Variant27b19f8eda18ba84200048540a9afe423931b5019f317de472e6719ff4e6c475.lean#L915).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fca833014ac94836ce6d4e75788c5938524b3587` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
