## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:46ffbad5-6f31-f265-eaa5-8b3d2d266df0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 931–947.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem leftComm_symm_tmul (m : M) (n : N) (p : P) :
    (leftComm R M N P).symm (n ⊗ₜ (m ⊗ₜ p)) = m ⊗ₜ (n ⊗ₜ p) :=
  rfl
#align tensor_product.left_comm_symm_tmul TensorProduct.leftComm_symm_tmul

variable (M N P Q)

/-- This special case is worth defining explicitly since it is useful for defining multiplication
on tensor products of modules carrying multiplications (e.g., associative rings, Lie rings, ...).

E.g., suppose `M = P` and `N = Q` and that `M` and `N` carry bilinear multiplications:
`M ⊗ M → M` and `N ⊗ N → N`. Using `map`, we can define `(M ⊗ M) ⊗ (N ⊗ N) → M ⊗ N` which, when
combined with this definition, yields a bilinear multiplication on `M ⊗ N`:
`(M ⊗ N) ⊗ (M ⊗ N) → M ⊗ N`. In particular we could use this to define the multiplication in
the `TensorProduct.semiring` instance (currently defined "by hand" using `TensorProduct.mul`).

See also `mul_mul_mul_comm`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/TensorProduct/Variantfa954dbae214adcdd2bbe67665e81e1ae1e7968330e21e014dcf5b2307748de9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/TensorProduct/Variantfa954dbae214adcdd2bbe67665e81e1ae1e7968330e21e014dcf5b2307748de9.lean#L931).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `085fb3064e6e44b184dad568041415acb40a6a08` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
