## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8ee64a200b97d96955ee7f02ae0e93142e9239b5e409e5c5aec7539d7200fc39`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 81–90.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def directSumRight : (M₁' ⊗[R] ⨁ i, M₂ i) ≃ₗ[S] ⨁ i, M₁' ⊗[R] M₂ i :=
  TensorProduct.AlgebraTensorModule.congr (DirectSum.lid _ _).symm 1 ≪≫ₗ
  TensorProduct.directSum R S (fun _ : Unit ↦ M₁') M₂ ≪≫ₗ
  DirectSum.lequivCongrLeft S (Equiv.uniqueProd _ _)

@[deprecated (since := "2026-03-04")] alias directSumRight' := directSumRight

variable {M₁ M₁' M₂ M₂'}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/TensorProduct/Variant4a6e4fd44962b288f79fe3d22272a4995fcfa04a7717f8bdf47dfad56f6f991f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/TensorProduct/Variant4a6e4fd44962b288f79fe3d22272a4995fcfa04a7717f8bdf47dfad56f6f991f.lean#L81).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80e6a90d93817c18c3e8d2b6242df78cd48cf5d8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
