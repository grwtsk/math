## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2c63fd85a21da0ed033a9f6ea52a19400f5de36155c3191a5ea93df54f90b750`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 67–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def quotientEquivOfIsCompl (h : IsCompl p q) : (E ⧸ p) ≃ₗ[R] q :=
  LinearEquiv.symm <|
    LinearEquiv.ofBijective (p.mkQ.comp q.subtype)
      ⟨by rw [← ker_eq_bot, ker_comp, ker_mkQ, disjoint_iff_comap_eq_bot.1 h.symm.disjoint], by
        rw [← range_eq_top, range_comp, range_subtype, map_mkQ_eq_top, h.sup_eq_top]⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projection/Variantea210ed98daa9359c8879bc8b4eee299f65af98d9275517dcc45b44d0634e672.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projection/Variantea210ed98daa9359c8879bc8b4eee299f65af98d9275517dcc45b44d0634e672.lean#L67).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2b5d3bccabca45bd6a4d9a3a9a4fcbfd01ce2039` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
