## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:83a07bb2-d22d-f36d-b55e-affe8d8ef6c0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 295–336.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Characterization of minimizers in the projection on a subspace.
Let `u` be a point in an inner product space, and let `K` be a nonempty subspace.
Then point `v` minimizes the distance `‖u - v‖` over points in `K` if and only if
for all `w ∈ K`, `⟪u - v, w⟫ = 0` (i.e., `u - v` is orthogonal to the subspace `K`)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projection/Variantbfae44632f790418c8c66f66f37c70fb4f29e9093925824fa9017f0700abcddc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projection/Variantbfae44632f790418c8c66f66f37c70fb4f29e9093925824fa9017f0700abcddc.lean#L295).
