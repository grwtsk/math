## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:417bb8c6-e257-57db-334a-af6721d4d986`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 936–939.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_zero_of_mem_orthogonal (hK : Dense (K : Set E)) (h : x ∈ Kᗮ) : x = 0 :=
  eq_zero_of_inner_left hK fun v ↦ (mem_orthogonal' _ _).1 h _ v.2

/-- If `S` is dense and `x - y ∈ Kᗮ`, then `x = y`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projection/Variantbfae44632f790418c8c66f66f37c70fb4f29e9093925824fa9017f0700abcddc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projection/Variantbfae44632f790418c8c66f66f37c70fb4f29e9093925824fa9017f0700abcddc.lean#L936).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d26dfd7da00bf3f6f0cc3256bccf3676daea1856` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
