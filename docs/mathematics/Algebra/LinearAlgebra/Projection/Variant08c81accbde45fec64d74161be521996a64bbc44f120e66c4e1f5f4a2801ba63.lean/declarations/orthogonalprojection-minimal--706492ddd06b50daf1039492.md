## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:af428df7-b852-ad14-0cd2-a53e3a3a9894`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 564–570.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem orthogonalProjection_minimal {U : Submodule 𝕜 E} [HasOrthogonalProjection U] (y : E) :
    ‖y - orthogonalProjection U y‖ = ⨅ x : U, ‖y - x‖ := by
  rw [norm_eq_iInf_iff_inner_eq_zero _ (Submodule.coe_mem _)]
  exact orthogonalProjection_inner_eq_zero _
#align orthogonal_projection_minimal orthogonalProjection_minimal

/-- The orthogonal projections onto equal subspaces are coerced back to the same point in `E`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projection/Variant08c81accbde45fec64d74161be521996a64bbc44f120e66c4e1f5f4a2801ba63.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projection/Variant08c81accbde45fec64d74161be521996a64bbc44f120e66c4e1f5f4a2801ba63.lean#L564).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e0bb95bd0e70c01a34341ae30299a7a56af087e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
