## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5318c08b-2e1f-f8af-1ea7-c2bdfe6ed7ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 488–497.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem projectionOnto_of_proj (f : E →ₗ[R] p) (hf : ∀ x : p, f x = x) :
    p.projectionOnto (ker f) (isCompl_of_proj hf) = f := by
  ext x
  have : x ∈ p ⊔ (ker f) := by simp only [(isCompl_of_proj hf).sup_eq_top, mem_top]
  rcases mem_sup'.1 this with ⟨x, y, rfl⟩
  simp [hf]

/-- If `f : E →ₗ[R] F` and `g : E →ₗ[R] G` are two surjective linear maps and
their kernels are complement of each other, then `x ↦ (f x, g x)` defines
a linear equivalence `E ≃ₗ[R] F × G`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projection/Variantf1f5b919ccc11a34a57a3e1ba53724b87f30533b2ba300a4800b17fb4190e279.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Projection/Variantf1f5b919ccc11a34a57a3e1ba53724b87f30533b2ba300a4800b17fb4190e279.lean#L488).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f7c47056b32002f3958065d034d1e839a5ad3b92` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
