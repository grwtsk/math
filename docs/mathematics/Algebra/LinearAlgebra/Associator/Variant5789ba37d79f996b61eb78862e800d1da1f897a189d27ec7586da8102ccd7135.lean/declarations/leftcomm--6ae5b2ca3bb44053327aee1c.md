## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8f9bb8e8f17481095e80c2c9285de07c9b2ed71d068aba9789e517686cf30055`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 218–226.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def leftComm : M ⊗[R] (N ⊗[R] P) ≃ₗ[R] N ⊗[R] (M ⊗[R] P) :=
  let e₁ := (TensorProduct.assoc R M N P).symm
  let e₂ := congr (TensorProduct.comm R M N) (1 : P ≃ₗ[R] P)
  let e₃ := TensorProduct.assoc R N M P
  e₁ ≪≫ₗ (e₂ ≪≫ₗ e₃)

variable {M N P Q}

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Associator/Variant5789ba37d79f996b61eb78862e800d1da1f897a189d27ec7586da8102ccd7135.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Associator/Variant5789ba37d79f996b61eb78862e800d1da1f897a189d27ec7586da8102ccd7135.lean#L218).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `feccf5348a2553cb4f456aeca001d460c14e846e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
