## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:328fc07d-f816-66a4-e458-150f16d886e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 259–275.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma rightComm_def : rightComm R M N P =
    TensorProduct.assoc R _ _ _ ≪≫ₗ congr (.refl _ _) (TensorProduct.comm _ _ _) ≪≫ₗ
      (TensorProduct.assoc R _ _ _).symm := by
  apply LinearEquiv.toLinearMap_injective; ext; rfl

variable (M N P Q)

/-- This special case is worth defining explicitly since it is useful for defining multiplication
on tensor products of modules carrying multiplications (e.g., associative rings, Lie rings, ...).

E.g., suppose `M = P` and `N = Q` and that `M` and `N` carry bilinear multiplications:
`M ⊗ M → M` and `N ⊗ N → N`. Using `map`, we can define `(M ⊗ M) ⊗ (N ⊗ N) → M ⊗ N` which, when
combined with this definition, yields a bilinear multiplication on `M ⊗ N`:
`(M ⊗ N) ⊗ (M ⊗ N) → M ⊗ N`. In particular we could use this to define the multiplication in
the `TensorProduct.semiring` instance (currently defined "by hand" using `TensorProduct.mul`).

See also `mul_mul_mul_comm`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Associator/Variant5789ba37d79f996b61eb78862e800d1da1f897a189d27ec7586da8102ccd7135.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Associator/Variant5789ba37d79f996b61eb78862e800d1da1f897a189d27ec7586da8102ccd7135.lean#L259).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `feccf5348a2553cb4f456aeca001d460c14e846e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
