## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c2359781d522522d0b23a622028bd8a71eb0be7c8f2cbbf3af992a606b94ee24`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 213–226.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def liftEquiv : {fg : (A →ₐ[S] C) × (B →ₐ[R] C) // ∀ x y, Commute (fg.1 x) (fg.2 y)}
    ≃ ((A ⊗[R] B) →ₐ[S] C) where
  toFun fg := lift fg.val.1 fg.val.2 fg.prop
  invFun f' := ⟨(f'.comp includeLeft, (f'.restrictScalars R).comp includeRight), fun _ _ =>
    ((Commute.one_right _).tmul (Commute.one_left _)).map f'⟩
  left_inv fg := by ext <;> simp
  right_inv f' := by ext <;> simp

variable (R S B) in
/--
Algebra maps `S ⊗[R] B →ₐ[S] C` are the same as algebra maps `B →ₐ[R] C`.
Variant of `Algebra.TensorProduct.liftEquiv` where the left map is fixed.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Maps/Variante41a14113a2ceef4266006934bdd1a661efd491280d7d73fa1d3e4e665b1224a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Maps/Variante41a14113a2ceef4266006934bdd1a661efd491280d7d73fa1d3e4e665b1224a.lean#L213).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `eed6bc25275c7805e3ef5654effd7c12536fb4bf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
