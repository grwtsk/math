## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:abc5316a-0070-2c44-2c3a-8d7e807c5585`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 652–667.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem range_dualMap_mkQ_eq (W : Submodule R M) :
    LinearMap.range W.mkQ.dualMap = W.dualAnnihilator := by
  ext φ
  rw [LinearMap.mem_range]
  constructor
  · rintro ⟨ψ, rfl⟩
    have := LinearMap.mem_range_self W.mkQ.dualMap ψ
    simpa only [ker_mkQ] using W.mkQ.range_dualMap_le_dualAnnihilator_ker this
  · intro hφ
    exists W.dualCopairing ⟨φ, hφ⟩

/-- Equivalence $(M/W)^* \cong \operatorname{ann}(W)$. That is, there is a one-to-one
correspondence between the dual of `M ⧸ W` and those elements of the dual of `M` that
vanish on `W`.

The inverse of this is `Submodule.dualCopairing`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Lemmas/Variant90458fc414f26ec74a78b3198adb7e479f274270de844d6afbbe2535e76dcc7a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Lemmas/Variant90458fc414f26ec74a78b3198adb7e479f274270de844d6afbbe2535e76dcc7a.lean#L652).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8aa2c24ddd90e87628e34d8f74d6ed1f8bcf3cfc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
