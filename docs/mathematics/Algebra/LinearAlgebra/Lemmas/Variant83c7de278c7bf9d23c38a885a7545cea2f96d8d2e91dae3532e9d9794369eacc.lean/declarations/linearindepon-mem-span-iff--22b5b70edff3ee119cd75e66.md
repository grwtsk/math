## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:94343d66-1e11-7bf1-d7fd-9334fbeedf9f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 556–562.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem LinearIndepOn.mem_span_iff {s : Set ι} {a : ι} {f : ι → V} (h : LinearIndepOn K f s) :
    f a ∈ Submodule.span K (f '' s) ↔ (LinearIndepOn K f (insert a s) → a ∈ s) := by
  by_cases has : a ∈ s
  · exact iff_of_true (subset_span <| mem_image_of_mem f has) fun _ ↦ has
  simp [linearIndepOn_insert_iff, h, has]

/-- A shortcut to a convenient form for the negation in `LinearIndepOn.mem_span_iff`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Lemmas/Variant83c7de278c7bf9d23c38a885a7545cea2f96d8d2e91dae3532e9d9794369eacc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Lemmas/Variant83c7de278c7bf9d23c38a885a7545cea2f96d8d2e91dae3532e9d9794369eacc.lean#L556).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d4b7c89d186030cf8b9d7e23f901e9ce0bd0fee4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
