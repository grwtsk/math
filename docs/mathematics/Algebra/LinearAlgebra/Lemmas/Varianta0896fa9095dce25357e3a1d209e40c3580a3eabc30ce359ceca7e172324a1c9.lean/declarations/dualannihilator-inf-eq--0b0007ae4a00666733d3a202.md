## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:951089e2-4ede-c78d-821b-b07c310f5f7e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 826–848.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dualAnnihilator_inf_eq (W W' : Subspace K V₁) :
    (W ⊓ W').dualAnnihilator = W.dualAnnihilator ⊔ W'.dualAnnihilator := by
  refine le_antisymm ?_ (sup_dualAnnihilator_le_inf W W')
  let F : V₁ →ₗ[K] (V₁ ⧸ W) × V₁ ⧸ W' := (Submodule.mkQ W).prod (Submodule.mkQ W')
  have : LinearMap.ker F = W ⊓ W' := by simp only [F, LinearMap.ker_prod, ker_mkQ]
  rw [← this, ← LinearMap.range_dualMap_eq_dualAnnihilator_ker]
  intro φ
  rw [LinearMap.mem_range]
  rintro ⟨x, rfl⟩
  rw [Submodule.mem_sup]
  obtain ⟨⟨a, b⟩, rfl⟩ := (dualProdDualEquivDual K (V₁ ⧸ W) (V₁ ⧸ W')).surjective x
  obtain ⟨a', rfl⟩ := (dualQuotEquivDualAnnihilator W).symm.surjective a
  obtain ⟨b', rfl⟩ := (dualQuotEquivDualAnnihilator W').symm.surjective b
  use a', a'.property, b', b'.property
  rfl

-- This is also true if `V₁` is finite dimensional since one can restrict `ι` to some subtype
-- for which the infi and supr are the same.
-- The obstruction to the `dualAnnihilator_inf_eq` argument carrying through is that we need
-- for `Module.Dual R (Π (i : ι), V ⧸ W i) ≃ₗ[K] Π (i : ι), Module.Dual R (V ⧸ W i)`, which is not
-- true for infinite `ι`. One would need to add additional hypothesis on `W` (for example, it might
-- be true when the family is inf-closed).
-- TODO: generalize to `Sort`
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Lemmas/Varianta0896fa9095dce25357e3a1d209e40c3580a3eabc30ce359ceca7e172324a1c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Lemmas/Varianta0896fa9095dce25357e3a1d209e40c3580a3eabc30ce359ceca7e172324a1c9.lean#L826).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bb96529e984f8e60a35adfc67fd1cc2845b00ee8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
