## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:95d8ca92-5e7d-687d-37af-9a287b856049`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 54–60.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem finrank_lt [FiniteDimensional K V] {s : Submodule K V} (h : s ≠ ⊤) :
    finrank K s < finrank K V := by
  rw [← s.finrank_quotient_add_finrank, add_comm]
  rw [← Quotient.nontrivial_iff] at h
  exact Nat.lt_add_of_pos_right finrank_pos

/-- The sum of the dimensions of s + t and s ∩ t is the sum of the dimensions of s and t -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Lemmas/Variant38e9b521aa397a3dc091ce431e3629a4b44da131a17bbaa9d8d8ea5f0a5bd621.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Lemmas/Variant38e9b521aa397a3dc091ce431e3629a4b44da131a17bbaa9d8d8ea5f0a5bd621.lean#L54).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8171d9f0b1fdb801a43de697928bd0e744e22f61` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
