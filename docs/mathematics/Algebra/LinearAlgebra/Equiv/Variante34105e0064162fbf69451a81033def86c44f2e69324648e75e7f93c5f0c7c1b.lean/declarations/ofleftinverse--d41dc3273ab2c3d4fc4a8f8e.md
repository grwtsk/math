## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:742524f170ce589aecc73f606a8e45fac247de487e29c496d03ffbddc09eb3fd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 139–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofLeftInverse [RingHomInvPair σ₁₂ σ₂₁] [RingHomInvPair σ₂₁ σ₁₂] {g : M₂ → M}
    (h : Function.LeftInverse g f) : M ≃ₛₗ[σ₁₂] (LinearMap.range f) :=
  { LinearMap.rangeRestrict f with
    toFun := LinearMap.rangeRestrict f
    invFun := g ∘ (LinearMap.range f).subtype
    left_inv := h
    right_inv := fun x =>
      Subtype.ext <|
        let ⟨x', hx'⟩ := LinearMap.mem_range.mp x.prop
        show f (g x) = x by rw [← hx', h x'] }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Equiv/Variante34105e0064162fbf69451a81033def86c44f2e69324648e75e7f93c5f0c7c1b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Equiv/Variante34105e0064162fbf69451a81033def86c44f2e69324648e75e7f93c5f0c7c1b.lean#L139).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27359e19ebb69e25962e15cdc831a81851643b5e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
