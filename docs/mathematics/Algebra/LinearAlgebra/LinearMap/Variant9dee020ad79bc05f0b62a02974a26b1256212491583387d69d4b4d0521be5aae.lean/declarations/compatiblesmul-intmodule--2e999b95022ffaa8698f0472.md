## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2abd6be7662c4b492422d19f154847596213c6b95e110e7845db1ef23ab981be`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 617–625.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance CompatibleSMul.intModule {S : Type*} [Semiring S] [Module S M] [Module S M₂] :
    CompatibleSMul M M₂ ℤ S :=
  ⟨fun fₗ c x ↦ by
    induction c using Int.induction_on
    case hz => simp
    case hp n ih => simp [add_smul, ih]
    case hn n ih => simp [sub_smul, ih]⟩
#align linear_map.compatible_smul.int_module LinearMap.CompatibleSMul.intModule

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearMap/Variant9dee020ad79bc05f0b62a02974a26b1256212491583387d69d4b4d0521be5aae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearMap/Variant9dee020ad79bc05f0b62a02974a26b1256212491583387d69d4b4d0521be5aae.lean#L617).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9feb83ebac684637800434c22c833cd2628a0c2b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
