## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e0fdc78c597a98bdb0859a9603b8c51890e9e155fb80e17be81454500bbcc89b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 151–165.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev LinearMapClass (F : Type*) (R M M₂ : outParam (Type*)) [Semiring R] [AddCommMonoid M]
    [AddCommMonoid M₂] [Module R M] [Module R M₂] :=
  SemilinearMapClass F (RingHom.id R) M M₂
#align linear_map_class LinearMapClass

namespace SemilinearMapClass

variable (F : Type*)
variable [Semiring R] [Semiring S]
variable [AddCommMonoid M] [AddCommMonoid M₁] [AddCommMonoid M₂] [AddCommMonoid M₃]
variable [AddCommMonoid N₁] [AddCommMonoid N₂] [AddCommMonoid N₃]
variable [Module R M] [Module R M₂] [Module S M₃]
variable {σ : R →+* S}

-- Porting note: the `dangerousInstance` linter has become smarter about `outParam`s
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearMap/Variant082cf928f4f8e9fb45f05a8162c31bd5c9d1a369566e4134791acd9d71709e08.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/LinearMap/Variant082cf928f4f8e9fb45f05a8162c31bd5c9d1a369566e4134791acd9d71709e08.lean#L151).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `228502941109329435282b9aad1f8aa47da946ef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
