## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ba0f4045-7783-f1a8-99c0-754abfb9b464`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pow_mulRight (a : A) (n : ℕ) : mulRight R a ^ n = mulRight R (a ^ n) :=
  match n with
  | 0 => by rw [pow_zero, pow_zero, mulRight_one, Module.End.one_eq_id]
  | (n + 1) => by rw [pow_succ, pow_succ', mulRight_mul, Module.End.mul_eq_comp, pow_mulRight]

end right

end one_side

variable [CommSemiring R] [Semiring A] [Algebra R A]

/-- The multiplication in an algebra is an algebra homomorphism into the endomorphisms on
the algebra.

A weaker version of this for non-unital algebras exists as `NonUnitalAlgHom.lmul`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Bilinear/Variant44a53bfb68a2bc86b72a4fcc8d75496330f5fb25941ecf1bda82d58a1a5967bc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Bilinear/Variant44a53bfb68a2bc86b72a4fcc8d75496330f5fb25941ecf1bda82d58a1a5967bc.lean#L136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `211f36d0c5236474858b1590ac1e8281c4ced41f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
