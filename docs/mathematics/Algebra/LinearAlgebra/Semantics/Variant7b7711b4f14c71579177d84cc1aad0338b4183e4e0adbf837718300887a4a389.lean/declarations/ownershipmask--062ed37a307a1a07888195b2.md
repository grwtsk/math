## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8e436c6252ff1c43a33e6671ddf05a1ac28a3d76e2eb9844d93c8342c399ccda`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 33–35.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev OwnershipMask (rows columns : Nat) := BitMatrix rows columns

/-- A normalized finite raster state. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Semantics/Variant7b7711b4f14c71579177d84cc1aad0338b4183e4e0adbf837718300887a4a389.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Semantics/Variant7b7711b4f14c71579177d84cc1aad0338b4183e4e0adbf837718300887a4a389.lean#L33).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f7e6c3efbfc443952fe8ef2e7c34d14d510b00c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
