## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6e0d9da7-024a-2c62-1361-bbba705a2883`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 731–742.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isRoot_twoTorsionPolynomial_of_add_self {x y : F} (h : W.Nonsingular x y)
    (hP : some x y h + some x y h = 0) : W.twoTorsionPolynomial.toPoly.IsRoot x := by
  rw [IsRoot.def, eval_toPoly_twoTorsionPolynomial, b₂, b₄, b₆]
  have hy : y = W.negY x y := by
    by_contra hne
    rw [add_self_of_Y_ne hne] at hP
    exact some_ne_zero _ hP
  grind [h.left, negY, equation_iff]

/-- `x` is a root of the `2`-torsion polynomial of a Weierstrass curve of characteristic
different from `2` with nonzero discriminant if and only if it is the `X`-coordinate of a nonzero
affine `2`-torsion point. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Point/Variant691435dc47a3dce0a91fb227f02772d559820903b5fa1a0a9507f020d90289e5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Point/Variant691435dc47a3dce0a91fb227f02772d559820903b5fa1a0a9507f020d90289e5.lean#L731).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cf272ceb489303c0678628e8176ba9c2f5174357` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
