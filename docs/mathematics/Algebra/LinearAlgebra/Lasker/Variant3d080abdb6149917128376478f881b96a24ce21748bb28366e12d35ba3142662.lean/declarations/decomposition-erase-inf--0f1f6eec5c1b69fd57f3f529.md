## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:614afd44-5218-3a36-2727-4e928f00af7d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 54–69.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma decomposition_erase_inf {N : Submodule R M}
    {s : Finset (Submodule R M)} (hs : s.inf id = N) :
    ∃ t : Finset (Submodule R M), t ⊆ s ∧ t.inf id = N ∧
      ∀ ⦃J⦄, J ∈ t → ¬ (t.erase J).inf id ≤ J := by
  induction s using Finset.eraseInduction with
  | H s IH =>
    by_cases! H : ∀ J ∈ s, ¬ (s.erase J).inf id ≤ J
    · exact ⟨s, Finset.Subset.rfl, hs, H⟩
    obtain ⟨J, hJ, hJ'⟩ := H
    refine (IH _ hJ ?_).imp
      fun t ↦ And.imp_left (fun ht ↦ ht.trans (Finset.erase_subset _ _))
    rw [← Finset.insert_erase hJ] at hs
    simp [-Finset.insert_erase_eq_insert, ← hs, hJ']

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Lasker/Variant3d080abdb6149917128376478f881b96a24ce21748bb28366e12d35ba3142662.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Lasker/Variant3d080abdb6149917128376478f881b96a24ce21748bb28366e12d35ba3142662.lean#L54).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1b367b6f511819633bbbda18166404bcac7ac60` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
