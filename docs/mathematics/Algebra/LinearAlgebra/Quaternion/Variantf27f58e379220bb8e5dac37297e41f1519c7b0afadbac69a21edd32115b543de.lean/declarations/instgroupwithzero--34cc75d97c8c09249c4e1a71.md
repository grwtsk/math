## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8641346b638c3ac874313e0c83faf6c7730e1395c369989ac3ff7d6fa8155722`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1220–1228.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instGroupWithZero : GroupWithZero ℍ[R] :=
  { Quaternion.instNontrivial with
    inv := Inv.inv
    inv_zero := by rw [instInv_inv, star_zero, smul_zero]
    mul_inv_cancel := fun a ha => by
      rw [instInv_inv, Algebra.mul_smul_comm (normSq a)⁻¹ a (star a), self_mul_star, smul_coe,
        inv_mul_cancel₀ (normSq_ne_zero.2 ha), coe_one] }

@[norm_cast, simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Quaternion/Variantf27f58e379220bb8e5dac37297e41f1519c7b0afadbac69a21edd32115b543de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Quaternion/Variantf27f58e379220bb8e5dac37297e41f1519c7b0afadbac69a21edd32115b543de.lean#L1220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7a0cd2b7b8aa3bc92710525b5d0075ba1e0ba557` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
