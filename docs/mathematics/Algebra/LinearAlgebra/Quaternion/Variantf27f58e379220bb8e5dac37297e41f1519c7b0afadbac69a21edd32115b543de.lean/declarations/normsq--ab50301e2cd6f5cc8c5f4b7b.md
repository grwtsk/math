## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:27fed42986a2d79254ee51f55f6793b66ac1c7cf5cb53328801cb49e922dde41`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1089–1096.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def normSq : ℍ[R] →*₀ R where
  toFun a := (a * star a).re
  map_zero' := by simp only [star_zero, zero_mul, zero_re]
  map_one' := by simp only [star_one, one_mul, one_re]
  map_mul' x y := coe_injective <| by
    conv_lhs => rw [← mul_star_eq_coe, star_mul, mul_assoc, ← mul_assoc y, y.mul_star_eq_coe,
      coe_commutes, ← mul_assoc, x.mul_star_eq_coe, ← coe_mul]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Quaternion/Variantf27f58e379220bb8e5dac37297e41f1519c7b0afadbac69a21edd32115b543de.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Quaternion/Variantf27f58e379220bb8e5dac37297e41f1519c7b0afadbac69a21edd32115b543de.lean#L1089).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7a0cd2b7b8aa3bc92710525b5d0075ba1e0ba557` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
