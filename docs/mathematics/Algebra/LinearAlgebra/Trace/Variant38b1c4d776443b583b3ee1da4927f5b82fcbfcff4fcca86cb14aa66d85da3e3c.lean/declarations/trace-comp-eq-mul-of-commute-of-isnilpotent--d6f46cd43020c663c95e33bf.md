## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ef761aa9-8d34-063f-364d-0d2da66b3c58`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 371–385.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma trace_comp_eq_mul_of_commute_of_isNilpotent [IsReduced R] {f g : Module.End R M}
    (μ : R) (h_comm : Commute f g) (hg : IsNilpotent (g - algebraMap R _ μ)) :
    trace R M (f ∘ₗ g) = μ * trace R M f := by
  set n := g - algebraMap R _ μ
  replace hg : trace R M (f ∘ₗ n) = 0 := by
    rw [← isNilpotent_iff_eq_zero, ← Module.End.mul_eq_comp]
    refine isNilpotent_trace_of_isNilpotent (Commute.isNilpotent_mul_left ?_ hg)
    exact h_comm.sub_right (Algebra.commute_algebraMap_right μ f)
  have hμ : g = algebraMap R _ μ + n := eq_add_of_sub_eq' rfl
  have : f ∘ₗ algebraMap R _ μ = μ • f := by ext; simp -- TODO Surely exists?
  rw [hμ, comp_add, map_add, hg, add_zero, this, map_smul, smul_eq_mul]

-- This result requires `Mathlib/RingTheory/TensorProduct/Free.lean`.
-- Maybe it should move elsewhere?
@[simp]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Trace/Variant38b1c4d776443b583b3ee1da4927f5b82fcbfcff4fcca86cb14aa66d85da3e3c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Trace/Variant38b1c4d776443b583b3ee1da4927f5b82fcbfcff4fcca86cb14aa66d85da3e3c.lean#L371).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `95fc2cff42ba059c3818fb3a4aba5da9382fbf71` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
