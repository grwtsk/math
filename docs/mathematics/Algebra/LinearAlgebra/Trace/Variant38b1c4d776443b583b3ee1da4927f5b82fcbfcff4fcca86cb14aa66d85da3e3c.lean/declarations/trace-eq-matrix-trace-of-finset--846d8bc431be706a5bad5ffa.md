## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:15866dc3-6f7f-78a4-4f53-d0cff9e49239`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem trace_eq_matrix_trace_of_finset {s : Finset M} (b : Basis s R M) (f : M →ₗ[R] M) :
    trace R M f = Matrix.trace (LinearMap.toMatrix b b f) := by
  have : ∃ s : Finset M, Nonempty (Basis s R M) := ⟨s, ⟨b⟩⟩
  rw [trace, dite_eq_left this, ← traceAux_def]
  congr 1
  apply traceAux_eq

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Trace/Variant38b1c4d776443b583b3ee1da4927f5b82fcbfcff4fcca86cb14aa66d85da3e3c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Trace/Variant38b1c4d776443b583b3ee1da4927f5b82fcbfcff4fcca86cb14aa66d85da3e3c.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `95fc2cff42ba059c3818fb3a4aba5da9382fbf71` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
