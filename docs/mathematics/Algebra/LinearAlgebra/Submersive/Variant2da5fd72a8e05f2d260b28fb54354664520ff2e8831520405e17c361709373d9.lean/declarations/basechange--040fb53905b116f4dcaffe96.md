## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:70daec7897cb9275dd7de1eeb974cc8004da6b2098764d3d4947a334fdd4df38`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 593–604.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def baseChange : SubmersivePresentation T (T ⊗[R] S) ι σ where
  toPreSubmersivePresentation := P.toPreSubmersivePresentation.baseChange T
  jacobian_isUnit :=
    P.baseChange_jacobian T ▸ P.jacobian_isUnit.map TensorProduct.includeRight

end BaseChange

variable {R S ι σ} in
/-- Given a submersive presentation `P` and equivalences `ι' ≃ ι` and
`σ' ≃ σ`, this is the induced submersive presentation with variables indexed
by `ι'` and relations indexed by `σ'` -/
@[simps toPreSubmersivePresentation]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Submersive/Variant2da5fd72a8e05f2d260b28fb54354664520ff2e8831520405e17c361709373d9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Submersive/Variant2da5fd72a8e05f2d260b28fb54354664520ff2e8831520405e17c361709373d9.lean#L593).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9a632fa02f723d2d86edccb2d3d23ff4ac4f3297` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
