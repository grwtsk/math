## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:733f39eb-777b-7e90-68a5-749e7473be5a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 514–520.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma baseChange_comp (C' : VariableChange R) :
    baseChange A (C.comp C') = (baseChange A C).comp (baseChange A C') := by
  simp only [comp, baseChange]
  ext <;> simp only [Units.coe_map, Units.coe_map_inv, MonoidHom.coe_coe,
    map_ofNat, map_neg, map_add, map_sub, map_mul, map_pow]

/-- The base change of change of variables over `R` to `A` is a group homomorphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Weierstrass/Variant38c601376d17198248476eee6b84d427c8ee43d973470372d5bbbc2e9fee8f28.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Weierstrass/Variant38c601376d17198248476eee6b84d427c8ee43d973470372d5bbbc2e9fee8f28.lean#L514).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c6a2fc39e4dcc96ebfcdbdef0e3f1103e3591c87` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
