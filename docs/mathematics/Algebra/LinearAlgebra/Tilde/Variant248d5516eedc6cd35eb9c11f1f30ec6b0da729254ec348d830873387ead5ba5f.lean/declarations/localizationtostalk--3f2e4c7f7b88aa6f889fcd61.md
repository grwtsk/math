## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6183d368f0eee0c275d43e84e4861c6ae8296ea76d39f21afd41baf37f9d77e1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 259–267.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def localizationToStalk (x : PrimeSpectrum.Top R) :
    ModuleCat.of R (LocalizedModule x.asIdeal.primeCompl M) ⟶
    (TopCat.Presheaf.stalk (tildeInModuleCat M) x) :=
  ModuleCat.ofHom <| LocalizedModule.lift _ (toStalk M x).hom <| isUnit_toStalk M x


/-- The ring homomorphism that takes a section of the structure sheaf of `R` on the open set `U`,
implemented as a subtype of dependent functions to localizations at prime ideals, and evaluates
the section on the point corresponding to a given prime ideal. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Tilde/Variant248d5516eedc6cd35eb9c11f1f30ec6b0da729254ec348d830873387ead5ba5f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/Tilde/Variant248d5516eedc6cd35eb9c11f1f30ec6b0da729254ec348d830873387ead5ba5f.lean#L259).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `44a65da3bac6ece773f3afe802846643ecbf2a9b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
