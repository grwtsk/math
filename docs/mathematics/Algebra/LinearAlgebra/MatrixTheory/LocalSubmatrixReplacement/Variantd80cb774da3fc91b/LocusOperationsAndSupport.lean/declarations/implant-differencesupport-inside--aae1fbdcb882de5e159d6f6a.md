## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:27979fa4-31b3-6d53-4693-eddc32d284f1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 135–148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem implant_differenceSupport_inside
    (A : BitMatrix m n) (L : MatrixLocus m n)
    (replacement : BitMatrix L.rows.card L.columns.card)
    {i : Fin m} {j : Fin n}
    (h : (i, j) ∈ differenceSupport (implantSubmatrix A L replacement) A) :
    i ∈ L.rows ∧ j ∈ L.columns := by
  have hdiff := (mem_differenceSupport_iff _ _ _ _).mp h
  constructor
  · by_contra hi
    exact hdiff (implantSubmatrix_outside A L replacement i j (Or.inl hi))
  · by_contra hj
    exact hdiff (implantSubmatrix_outside A L replacement i j (Or.inr hj))

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/MatrixTheory/LocalSubmatrixReplacement/Variantd80cb774da3fc91b/LocusOperationsAndSupport.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/MatrixTheory/LocalSubmatrixReplacement/Variantd80cb774da3fc91b/LocusOperationsAndSupport.lean#L135).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b2ea09b0c30aea1423002e4f9e04aa0aed589e8f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
