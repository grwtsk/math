## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e143f10e9b36d51a4da41ed3362af01509afc9bdfbcd20990713f3b932386166`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 217–225.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def instL2OpNormedSpace : NormedSpace 𝕜 (Matrix m n 𝕜) where
  norm_smul_le r x := by
    rw [l2_opNorm_def, LinearEquiv.map_smul]
    exact norm_smul_le r ((toEuclideanLin (𝕜 := 𝕜) (m := m) (n := n)).trans toContinuousLinearMap x)

scoped[Matrix.L2OpNorm] attribute [instance] Matrix.instL2OpNormedSpace

/-- The normed ring structure on `Matrix n n 𝕜` arising from the operator norm given by the
identification with (continuous) linear endmorphisms of `EuclideanSpace 𝕜 n`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/MatrixTheory/Variantcf3b1a4198979ea64344e1c6d2fef0eabdccc42e5c5da5c044699512a075d64f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Matrix/Variantcf3b1a4198979ea64344e1c6d2fef0eabdccc42e5c5da5c044699512a075d64f.lean#L217).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dd4f2a74305ede1d35827fb7ad57733c242a0607` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
