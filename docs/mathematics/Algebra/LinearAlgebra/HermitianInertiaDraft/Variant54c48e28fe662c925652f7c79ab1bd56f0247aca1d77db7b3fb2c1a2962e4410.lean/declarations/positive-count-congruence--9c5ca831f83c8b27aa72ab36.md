## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fbacdc86-6827-f4a9-68b0-9e0dc9ef3af9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 83–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem positive_count_congruence (M P : Matrix σ σ ℂ) (hM : M.IsHermitian)
    (hP : P.det ≠ 0) (hN : (Pᴴ * M * P).IsHermitian) :
    Fintype.card {i // 0 < hN.eigenvalues i} =
      Fintype.card {i // 0 < hM.eigenvalues i} := by
  have he : Equivalent (realForm (Pᴴ*M*P) hN) (realForm M hM) := by
    rw [realForm_congruence M P hM hP hN]
    exact ⟨(isometryEquivOfCompLinearEquiv (realForm M hM)
      (congruenceCoordinates P hP)).symm⟩
  have h := he.sigPos_eq
  rw [sigPos_realForm, sigPos_realForm] at h
  omega

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/HermitianInertiaDraft/Variant54c48e28fe662c925652f7c79ab1bd56f0247aca1d77db7b3fb2c1a2962e4410.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/HermitianInertiaDraft/Variant54c48e28fe662c925652f7c79ab1bd56f0247aca1d77db7b3fb2c1a2962e4410.lean#L83).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6169035f6185d311fc0badea47cb29c249a0ef24` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
