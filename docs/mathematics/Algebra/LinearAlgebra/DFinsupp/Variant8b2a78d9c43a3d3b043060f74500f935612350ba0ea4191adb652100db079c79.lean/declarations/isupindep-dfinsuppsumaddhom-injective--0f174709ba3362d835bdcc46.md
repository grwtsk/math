## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e5ee4cb9-9e8c-9ee3-9764-246df64ae422`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 560–575.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iSupIndep.dfinsuppSumAddHom_injective {p : ι → AddSubgroup N} (h : iSupIndep p) :
    Function.Injective (sumAddHom fun i => (p i).subtype) := by
  rw [← iSupIndep_map_orderIso_iff (AddSubgroup.toIntSubmodule : AddSubgroup N ≃o _)] at h
  exact h.dfinsupp_lsum_injective

@[deprecated (since := "2025-04-06")]
alias iSupIndep.dfinsupp_sumAddHom_injective := iSupIndep.dfinsuppSumAddHom_injective

@[deprecated (since := "2024-11-24")]
alias Independent.dfinsupp_sumAddHom_injective := iSupIndep.dfinsuppSumAddHom_injective

/-- A family of submodules over an additive group are independent if and only iff `DFinsupp.lsum`
applied with `Submodule.subtype` is injective.

Note that this is not generally true for `[Semiring R]`; see
`iSupIndep.dfinsupp_lsum_injective` for details. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/DFinsupp/Variant8b2a78d9c43a3d3b043060f74500f935612350ba0ea4191adb652100db079c79.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/DFinsupp/Variant8b2a78d9c43a3d3b043060f74500f935612350ba0ea4191adb652100db079c79.lean#L560).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b5f72f3b28433f982cfc0bb18073fd95858776a1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
