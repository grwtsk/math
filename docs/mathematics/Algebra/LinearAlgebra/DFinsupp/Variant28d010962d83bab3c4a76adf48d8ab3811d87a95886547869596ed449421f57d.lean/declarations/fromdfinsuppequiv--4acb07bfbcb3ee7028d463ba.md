## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ce65178464908b4778b09f3ee7391a9cb8b601d70900c3efd4d04ffd66cb1954`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 215–224.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def fromDFinsuppEquiv :
    ((p : Π i, κ i) → MultilinearMap R (fun i ↦ M i (p i)) N) ≃ₗ[R]
      MultilinearMap R (fun i ↦ Π₀ j : κ i, M i j) N :=
  LinearEquiv.ofLinearMap
    ((DFinsupp.lsum ℕ fun _ ↦ .id).compMultilinearMapₗ R ∘ₗ MultilinearMap.dfinsuppFamilyₗ)
    (LinearMap.pi fun p ↦ MultilinearMap.compLinearMapₗ fun i ↦ DFinsupp.lsingle (p i))
    (by ext f x; simp)
    (by ext f p a; simp)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/DFinsupp/Variant28d010962d83bab3c4a76adf48d8ab3811d87a95886547869596ed449421f57d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/DFinsupp/Variant28d010962d83bab3c4a76adf48d8ab3811d87a95886547869596ed449421f57d.lean#L215).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e69a7587e58d04e95afebdf525dec148f84cd603` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
