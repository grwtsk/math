## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7c520e24-9f8e-1f97-5d63-2e0e22cece77`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 488–500.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem independent_of_dfinsupp_sumAddHom_injective' (p : ι → AddSubgroup N)
    (h : Function.Injective (sumAddHom fun i => (p i).subtype)) : Independent p := by
  rw [← independent_map_orderIso_iff (AddSubgroup.toIntSubmodule : AddSubgroup N ≃o _)]
  exact independent_of_dfinsupp_lsum_injective _ h
#align complete_lattice.independent_of_dfinsupp_sum_add_hom_injective' CompleteLattice.independent_of_dfinsupp_sumAddHom_injective'

/-- The canonical map out of a direct sum of a family of submodules is injective when the submodules
are `CompleteLattice.Independent`.

Note that this is not generally true for `[Semiring R]`, for instance when `A` is the
`ℕ`-submodules of the positive and negative integers.

See `Counterexamples/DirectSumIsInternal.lean` for a proof of this fact. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/DFinsupp/Variant961b37bfcbf8c226cb4f406db2df91cb2b2b15f0df6a1ad15ec615c9b10c0ff0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearAlgebra/DFinsupp/Variant961b37bfcbf8c226cb4f406db2df91cb2b2b15f0df6a1ad15ec615c9b10c0ff0.lean#L488).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2f2e5435502e6e766f7dd21a03b748287c68c504` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
