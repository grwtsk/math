## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a99c9953-22b4-bd43-c752-5cb67646dfbd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Algebra.map_leftMulMatrix_localization {ι : Type*} [Fintype ι] [DecidableEq ι]
    (b : Basis ι R S) (a : S) :
    (algebraMap R Rₘ).mapMatrix (leftMulMatrix b a) =
    leftMulMatrix (b.localizationLocalization Rₘ M Sₘ) (algebraMap S Sₘ a) := by
  ext i j
  simp only [Matrix.map_apply, RingHom.mapMatrix_apply, leftMulMatrix_eq_repr_mul, ← map_mul,
    Basis.localizationLocalization_apply, Basis.localizationLocalization_repr_algebraMap]

/-- Let `S` be an extension of `R` and `Rₘ Sₘ` be localizations at `M` of `R S` respectively.
Then the norm of `a : Sₘ` over `Rₘ` is the norm of `a : S` over `R` if `S` is free as `R`-module.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/NormTrace/Variantcba905cb76497d4b912ae1c01c5509286382f0ff127d980a64d2c47f1ef401a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/NormTrace/Variantcba905cb76497d4b912ae1c01c5509286382f0ff127d980a64d2c47f1ef401a6.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7bc407027e4984117ebcde20b06acf79648f804e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
