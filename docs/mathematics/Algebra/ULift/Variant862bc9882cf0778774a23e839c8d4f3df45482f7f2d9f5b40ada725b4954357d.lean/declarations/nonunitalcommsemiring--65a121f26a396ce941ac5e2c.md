## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:225ab4dd947a60141eae5acf92fc90371e1cc32783fe7d8e46ac9a39b7402243`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 77–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance nonUnitalCommSemiring [NonUnitalCommSemiring R] : NonUnitalCommSemiring (ULift R) :=
  { zero := (0 : ULift R), add := (· + ·), mul := (· * ·), nsmul := AddMonoid.nsmul, add_assoc,
    zero_add, add_zero, add_comm, left_distrib, right_distrib, zero_mul, mul_zero, mul_assoc,
    mul_comm, nsmul_zero := fun _ => AddMonoid.nsmul_zero _,
    nsmul_succ := fun _ _ => AddMonoid.nsmul_succ _ _ }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/ULift/Variant862bc9882cf0778774a23e839c8d4f3df45482f7f2d9f5b40ada725b4954357d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/ULift/Variant862bc9882cf0778774a23e839c8d4f3df45482f7f2d9f5b40ada725b4954357d.lean#L77).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e6c89a97f272686cbeaeb51cc006a1c728a3fa65` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
