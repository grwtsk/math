## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1b8b2297-3115-4354-1796-eb49c97c720f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 33–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Ideal.span_eq_top_of_span_image_evalRingHom
    {ι} {R : ι → Type*} [∀ i, CommRing (R i)] (s : Set (Π i, R i))
    (hs : s.Finite) (hs' : ∀ i, Ideal.span (Pi.evalRingHom (R ·) i '' s) = ⊤) :
    Ideal.span s = ⊤ := by
  simp only [Ideal.eq_top_iff_one, ← Subtype.range_val (s := s), ← Set.range_comp,
    Finsupp.mem_ideal_span_range_iff_exists_finsupp] at hs' ⊢
  choose f hf using hs'
  have : Fintype s := hs.fintype
  refine ⟨Finsupp.equivFunOnFinite.symm fun i x ↦ f x i, ?_⟩
  ext i
  simpa [Finsupp.sum_fintype] using hf i

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/PointsPi/Variant5ac8966b2ec102647685c57d2e5b7f8b7ee0e41d57c69c5bbcc40a4ab8b9711b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/PointsPi/Variant5ac8966b2ec102647685c57d2e5b7f8b7ee0e41d57c69c5bbcc40a4ab8b9711b.lean#L33).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e1bf693e98ab823106ec19179a3ef4f9eb04470` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
