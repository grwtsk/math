## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ee35a8a2-88f9-6f1b-8ac7-490b2731dba9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 17–31.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem finite_ordered_energy {ι : Type*} [DecidableEq ι]
    (S : Finset ι) (x : ι → ℝ) :
    (∑ i ∈ S, x i)^2 = (∑ i ∈ S, (x i)^2) +
      ∑ i ∈ S, ∑ j ∈ S, if i ≠ j then x i * x j else 0 := by
  rw [pow_two, Finset.sum_mul_sum, ← Finset.sum_add_distrib]
  apply Finset.sum_congr rfl
  intro i hi
  have hd : x i ^ 2 = ∑ j ∈ S, if i = j then x i * x j else 0 := by simp [hi,pow_two]
  rw [hd, ← Finset.sum_add_distrib]
  apply Finset.sum_congr rfl
  intro j _

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/BigOperators/OrderedSquare.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/BigOperators/OrderedSquare.lean#L17).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a3c07fd53b112346fe548541c599437714722e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
