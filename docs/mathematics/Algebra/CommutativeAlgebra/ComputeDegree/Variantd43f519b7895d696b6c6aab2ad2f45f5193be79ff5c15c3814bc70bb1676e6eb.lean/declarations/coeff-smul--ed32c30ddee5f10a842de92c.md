## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8673be2a-8b88-c279-a6a4-85b84cf7a1f5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 149–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coeff_smul : (a • f).coeff n = a • f.coeff n := rfl

end SMul

section congr_lemmas

/-- The following two lemmas should be viewed as a hand-made "congr"-lemmas.
They achieve the following goals.
* They introduce *two* fresh metavariables replacing the given one `deg`,
  one for the `natDegree ≤` computation and one for the `coeff =` computation.
  This helps `compute_degree`, since it does not "pre-estimate" the degree,
  but it "picks it up along the way".
* They split checking the inequality `coeff p n ≠ 0` into the task of
  finding a value `c` for the `coeff` and then
  proving that this value is non-zero by `coeff_ne_zero`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ComputeDegree/Variantd43f519b7895d696b6c6aab2ad2f45f5193be79ff5c15c3814bc70bb1676e6eb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ComputeDegree/Variantd43f519b7895d696b6c6aab2ad2f45f5193be79ff5c15c3814bc70bb1676e6eb.lean#L149).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1df57ee8aca3403ebe07cdd32bea7113830bb7b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
