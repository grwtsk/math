## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:481ee3169795e700dfec5154c84159509d71cbd04c589a2521765588f7da0431`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 451–479.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def miscomputedDegree? (deg : Expr) : List Expr → List MessageData
  | tgt::tgts =>
    let rest := miscomputedDegree? deg tgts
    if tgt.ne?.isSome then
      m!"* the coefficient of degree {deg} may be zero" :: rest
    else if let some ((Expr.const ``Nat []), lhs, _) := tgt.le? then
      m!"* there is at least one term of naïve degree {lhs}" :: rest
    else if let some (_, lhs, _) := tgt.eq? then
      m!"* there may be a term of naïve degree {lhs}" :: rest
    else rest
  | [] => []

/--
`compute_degree` is a tactic to solve goals of the form
*  `natDegree f = d`,
*  `degree f = d`,
*  `natDegree f ≤ d` (or `<`),
*  `degree f ≤ d` (or `<`),
*  `coeff f d = r`, if `d` is the degree of `f`.

The tactic may leave goals of the form `d' = d`, `d' ≤ d`, `d' < d`, or `r ≠ 0`, where `d'` in `ℕ`
or `WithBot ℕ` is the tactic's guess of the degree, and `r` is the coefficient's guess of the
leading coefficient of `f`.

`compute_degree` applies `norm_num` to the left-hand side of all side goals, trying to close them.

The variant `compute_degree!` first applies `compute_degree`.
Then it uses `norm_num` on all the remaining goals and tries `assumption`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ComputeDegree/Variant3dc4652ae1ef3a5e4595688ba42cd7396e5b11bca0201443d0905cc1c4d4239a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ComputeDegree/Variant3dc4652ae1ef3a5e4595688ba42cd7396e5b11bca0201443d0905cc1c4d4239a.lean#L451).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `22f5c723b7c4823e8d7123b3af865ae9d6cb9caf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
