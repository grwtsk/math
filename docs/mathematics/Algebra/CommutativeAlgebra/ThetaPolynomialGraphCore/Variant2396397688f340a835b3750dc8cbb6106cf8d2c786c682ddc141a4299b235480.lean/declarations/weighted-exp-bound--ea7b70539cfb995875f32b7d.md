## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ea888c34-f3dd-4259-ca1a-d2126dafe7cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 125–138.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem weighted_exp_bound {x : ℝ} (hx : 0 ≤ x) :
    (1 + x ^ 2) * Real.exp |x| ≤ 3 * Real.exp (2 * x) := by
  rw [abs_of_nonneg hx]
  have h0 := Real.one_le_exp hx
  have h2 := Real.pow_div_factorial_le_exp x hx 2
  norm_num at h2
  have h := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right (show 1 + x ^ 2 ≤ 3 * Real.exp x by linarith)
    (Real.exp_pos x).le
  calc
    _ ≤ (3 * Real.exp x) * Real.exp x := h
    _ = _ := by rw [mul_assoc, ← Real.exp_add]; congr 2; ring

/-- The weighted measure has the exponential moment needed for both signed
annihilator densities; this is derived from the actual theta decay bound. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ThetaPolynomialGraphCore/Variant2396397688f340a835b3750dc8cbb6106cf8d2c786c682ddc141a4299b235480.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ThetaPolynomialGraphCore/Variant2396397688f340a835b3750dc8cbb6106cf8d2c786c682ddc141a4299b235480.lean#L125).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `74d7bf292d711254a5c8355d6ebed0d742d94693` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
