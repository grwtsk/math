## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aaff27c2-afce-dbbf-75af-96304f0bc66b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–173.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isUnit_iff' :
    IsUnit P ↔ IsUnit (eval 0 P) ∧ IsNilpotent (P /ₘ X)  := by
  suffices : P = C (eval 0 P) + X * (P /ₘ X)
  · conv_lhs => rw [this]; simp
  conv_lhs => rw [← modByMonic_add_div P monic_X]
  simp [modByMonic_X]

end CommRing

end Polynomial
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Nilpotent/Variant67026be6c212ff7e48e2f7deb5b6926965e500b1bf7c80bb562d4be2d87d3b3b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Nilpotent/Variant67026be6c212ff7e48e2f7deb5b6926965e500b1bf7c80bb562d4be2d87d3b3b.lean#L164).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
