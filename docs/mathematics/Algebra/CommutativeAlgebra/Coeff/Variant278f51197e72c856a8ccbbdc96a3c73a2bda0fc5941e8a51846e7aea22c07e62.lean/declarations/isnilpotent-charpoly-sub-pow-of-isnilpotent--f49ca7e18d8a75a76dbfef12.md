## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cb5488a3-8aaf-de89-51cd-6215ae2a2ee6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 364–380.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isNilpotent_charpoly_sub_pow_of_isNilpotent (hM : IsNilpotent M) :
    IsNilpotent (M.charpoly - X ^ (Fintype.card n)) := by
  nontriviality R
  let p : R[X] := M.charpolyRev
  have hp : p - 1 = X * (p /ₘ X) := by
    conv_lhs => rw [← modByMonic_add_div p monic_X]
    simp [p, modByMonic_X]
  have : IsNilpotent (p /ₘ X) :=
    (Polynomial.isUnit_iff'.mp (isUnit_charpolyRev_of_isNilpotent hM)).2
  have aux : (M.charpoly - X ^ (Fintype.card n)).natDegree ≤ M.charpoly.natDegree :=
    le_trans (natDegree_sub_le _ _) (by simp)
  rw [← isNilpotent_reflect_iff aux, reflect_sub, ← reverse, M.reverse_charpoly]
  simpa [p, hp]

end reverse

end Matrix
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Coeff/Variant278f51197e72c856a8ccbbdc96a3c73a2bda0fc5941e8a51846e7aea22c07e62.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Coeff/Variant278f51197e72c856a8ccbbdc96a3c73a2bda0fc5941e8a51846e7aea22c07e62.lean#L364).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `975ed8973f579e0f1cd7990918f2db5d52954b6f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
