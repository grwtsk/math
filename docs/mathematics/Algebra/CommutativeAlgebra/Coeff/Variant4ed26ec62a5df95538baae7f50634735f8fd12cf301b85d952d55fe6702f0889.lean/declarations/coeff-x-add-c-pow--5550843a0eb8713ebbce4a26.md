## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e1c628fb-5f48-acc8-7490-23d7706d4dcf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 297–307.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coeff_X_add_C_pow (r : R) (n k : ℕ) :
    ((X + C r) ^ n).coeff k = r ^ (n - k) * (n.choose k : R) := by
  rw [(commute_X (C r : R[X])).add_pow, ← lcoeff_apply, map_sum]
  simp only [one_pow, mul_one, lcoeff_apply, ← C_eq_natCast, ← C_pow, coeff_mul_C, Nat.cast_id]
  rw [Finset.sum_eq_single k, coeff_X_pow_self, one_mul]
  · intro _ _ h
    simp [coeff_X_pow, h.symm]
  · simp only [coeff_X_pow_self, one_mul, not_lt, Finset.mem_range]
    intro h
    rw [Nat.choose_eq_zero_of_lt h, Nat.cast_zero, mul_zero]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Coeff/Variant4ed26ec62a5df95538baae7f50634735f8fd12cf301b85d952d55fe6702f0889.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Coeff/Variant4ed26ec62a5df95538baae7f50634735f8fd12cf301b85d952d55fe6702f0889.lean#L297).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `13b9666e4c3036fb88db8011afae7dda62ca792b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
