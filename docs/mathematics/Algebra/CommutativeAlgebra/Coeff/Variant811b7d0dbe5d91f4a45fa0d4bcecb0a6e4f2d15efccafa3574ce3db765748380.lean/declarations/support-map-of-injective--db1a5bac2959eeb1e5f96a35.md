## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e8b94094-eca8-c2f7-4ed4-288780afa8f1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 215–221.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem support_map_of_injective [Semiring R] [Semiring S] (p : R[X]) {f : R →+* S}
    (hf : Function.Injective f) : (map f p).support = p.support := by
  simp_rw [Finset.ext_iff, mem_support_iff, coeff_map, ← map_zero f, hf.ne_iff,
    forall_const]

variable [CommSemiring R] [CommSemiring S] (f : R →+* S)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Coeff/Variant811b7d0dbe5d91f4a45fa0d4bcecb0a6e4f2d15efccafa3574ce3db765748380.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Coeff/Variant811b7d0dbe5d91f4a45fa0d4bcecb0a6e4f2d15efccafa3574ce3db765748380.lean#L215).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
