## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8dfb05c1-9188-c9ac-05c0-6cbe99698995`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 610–615.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pow_rootMultiplicity_dvd (p : R[X]) (a : R) : (X - C a) ^ rootMultiplicity a p ∣ p :=
  if h : p = 0 then by simp [h]
  else by
    rw [rootMultiplicity_eq_multiplicity, dif_neg h]; exact multiplicity.pow_multiplicity_dvd _
#align polynomial.pow_root_multiplicity_dvd Polynomial.pow_rootMultiplicity_dvd

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Div/Variantdc7fb152cb4fc858224e1aed6135113773c11d7c2189bc505b8be7c0a5912437.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Div/Variantdc7fb152cb4fc858224e1aed6135113773c11d7c2189bc505b8be7c0a5912437.lean#L610).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cdc1185195afec228ebf4e7148c738f4053f2e4a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
