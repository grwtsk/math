## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b9a61759-e5d9-66f8-8974-29d7f2fab202`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 446–454.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_divByMonic_eq_iff_isRoot : (X - C a) * (p /ₘ (X - C a)) = p ↔ IsRoot p a :=
  ⟨fun h => by
    rw [← h, IsRoot.def, eval_mul, eval_sub, eval_X, eval_C, sub_self, zero_mul],
    fun h : p.eval a = 0 => by
    conv_rhs =>
        rw [← modByMonic_add_div p (monic_X_sub_C a)]
        rw [modByMonic_X_sub_C_eq_C_eval, h, C_0, zero_add]⟩
#align polynomial.mul_div_by_monic_eq_iff_is_root Polynomial.mul_divByMonic_eq_iff_isRoot

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Div/Variantdc7fb152cb4fc858224e1aed6135113773c11d7c2189bc505b8be7c0a5912437.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Div/Variantdc7fb152cb4fc858224e1aed6135113773c11d7c2189bc505b8be7c0a5912437.lean#L446).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cdc1185195afec228ebf4e7148c738f4053f2e4a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
