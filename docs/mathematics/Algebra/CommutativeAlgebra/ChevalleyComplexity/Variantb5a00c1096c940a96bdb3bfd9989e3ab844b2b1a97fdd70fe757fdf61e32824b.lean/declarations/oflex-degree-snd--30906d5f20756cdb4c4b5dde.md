## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1ab486c2-f951-8c46-d979-161cf178c8cd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 135–141.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private lemma ofLex_degree_snd :
    (ofLex e.degree).snd ↔
     ¬ ∃ i, (e i).Monic ∧ ∀ j, e j ≠ 0 → (e i).degree ≤ (e j).degree := .rfl

variable (e) in
/-- The bound on the degree of the polynomials used to describe the constructible set appearing in
the case of `C : R → R[X]` of Chevalley's theorem with complexity bound. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ChevalleyComplexity/Variantb5a00c1096c940a96bdb3bfd9989e3ab844b2b1a97fdd70fe757fdf61e32824b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ChevalleyComplexity/Variantb5a00c1096c940a96bdb3bfd9989e3ab844b2b1a97fdd70fe757fdf61e32824b.lean#L135).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7201a976ef3fafeb2a26776aa5bdd22d7d398675` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
