## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c13f5b1f-2cf5-3154-4f61-7fa6dbbeec34`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 553–569.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem degree_sub_lt (hd : degree p = degree q) (hp0 : p ≠ 0)
    (hlc : leadingCoeff p = leadingCoeff q) : degree (p - q) < degree p :=
  have hp : monomial (natDegree p) (leadingCoeff p) + p.erase (natDegree p) = p :=
    monomial_add_erase _ _
  have hq : monomial (natDegree q) (leadingCoeff q) + q.erase (natDegree q) = q :=
    monomial_add_erase _ _
  have hd' : natDegree p = natDegree q := by unfold natDegree; rw [hd]
  have hq0 : q ≠ 0 := mt degree_eq_bot.2 (hd ▸ mt degree_eq_bot.1 hp0)
  calc
    degree (p - q) = degree (erase (natDegree q) p + -erase (natDegree q) q) := by
      conv =>
        lhs
        rw [← hp, ← hq, hlc, hd', add_sub_add_left_eq_sub, sub_eq_add_neg]
    _ ≤ max (degree (erase (natDegree q) p)) (degree (erase (natDegree q) q)) :=
      (degree_neg (erase (natDegree q) q) ▸ degree_add_le _ _)
    _ < degree p := max_lt_iff.2 ⟨hd' ▸ degree_erase_lt hp0, hd.symm ▸ degree_erase_lt hq0⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Definitions/Variant439ff0f65c5a0e3e6f163fdc2fb032a766ba5a493cddbcf0cf45464226823d13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Definitions/Variant439ff0f65c5a0e3e6f163fdc2fb032a766ba5a493cddbcf0cf45464226823d13.lean#L553).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e05ccc2c9839e09897620dfc1ec99f0f150ed679` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
