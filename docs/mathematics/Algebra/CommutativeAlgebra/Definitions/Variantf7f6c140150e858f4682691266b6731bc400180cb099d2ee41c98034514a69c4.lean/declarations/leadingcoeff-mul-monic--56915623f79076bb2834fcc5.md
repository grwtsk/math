## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fe2cf287-1fa8-ef0c-3365-26b5fb71b913`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1031–1041.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem leadingCoeff_mul_monic {p q : R[X]} (hq : Monic q) :
    leadingCoeff (p * q) = leadingCoeff p :=
  Decidable.byCases
    (fun H : leadingCoeff p = 0 => by
      rw [H, leadingCoeff_eq_zero.1 H, zero_mul, leadingCoeff_zero])
    fun H : leadingCoeff p ≠ 0 => by
      rw [leadingCoeff_mul', hq.leadingCoeff, mul_one]
      rwa [hq.leadingCoeff, mul_one]
#align polynomial.leading_coeff_mul_monic Polynomial.leadingCoeff_mul_monic

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Definitions/Variantf7f6c140150e858f4682691266b6731bc400180cb099d2ee41c98034514a69c4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Definitions/Variantf7f6c140150e858f4682691266b6731bc400180cb099d2ee41c98034514a69c4.lean#L1031).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c32330a119f10549496a3f07dc357aff475b9d8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
