## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c1d9c70a-c5b9-4f3f-a4e6-fe877c891043`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 68–74.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem source_polynomial_expansion (A y : ℝ) :
    unitSecond y / A ^ 2 - unitBump y / 4 =
      ∑ i : Fin 5, sourceCoefficient A i * mode i y := by
  rw [bump_expansion, second_expansion]
  simp only [sourceCoefficient, sub_mul, div_mul_eq_mul_div, Finset.sum_sub_distrib,
    Finset.sum_div]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/FiveModeSource/Variant9431fba75e185f0859930d40dae0be5ede00be73fffc5b80a073e48a4c2c3fa1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/FiveModeSource/Variant9431fba75e185f0859930d40dae0be5ede00be73fffc5b80a073e48a4c2c3fa1.lean#L68).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e24d7fd3cb4bbe396890cb946bb90f3b62c1225` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
