## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:74367a40-6ce9-c1a6-a28e-3728b2c9c941`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 707–724.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iterate_derivative_eq_zero_of_degree_lt {k : ℕ} {P : R[X]} (h : P.degree < k) :
    derivative^[k] P = 0 := by
  induction k generalizing P
  case zero => exact degree_eq_bot.mp <| WithBot.lt_coe_bot.mp h
  case succ k ind =>
    by_cases P = 0
    case pos hP => simp [hP]
    case neg hP =>
      rw [Function.iterate_add_apply, Function.iterate_one]
      by_cases derivative P = 0
      case pos hP' => simp [hP']
      case neg hP' =>
        have hP'' : P.natDegree ≠ 0 := by
          contrapose hP'
          exact derivative_of_natDegree_zero hP'
        refine ind <| (natDegree_lt_iff_degree_lt hP').mp ?_
        linarith [(natDegree_lt_iff_degree_lt hP).mpr h, natDegree_derivative_lt hP'']

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Derivative/Variant31f2b6851a860cd8bdae95bcf42e470b764777335fcfa0457283f0493561e975.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Derivative/Variant31f2b6851a860cd8bdae95bcf42e470b764777335fcfa0457283f0493561e975.lean#L707).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d70f88e48c223c2d4e7b2747717889acf4c0ff0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
