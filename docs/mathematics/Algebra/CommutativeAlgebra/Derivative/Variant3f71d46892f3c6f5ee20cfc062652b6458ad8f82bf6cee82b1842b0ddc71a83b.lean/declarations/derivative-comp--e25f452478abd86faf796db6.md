## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:947051db-1bb8-ef20-f5e6-f82deea6f233`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 538–547.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean

    derivative (p.comp q) = derivative q * p.derivative.comp q := by
  induction p using Polynomial.induction_on'
  · simp [*, mul_add]
  · simp only [derivative_pow, derivative_mul, monomial_comp, derivative_monomial, derivative_C,
      zero_mul, C_eq_nat_cast, zero_add, RingHom.map_mul]
    ring
#align polynomial.derivative_comp Polynomial.derivative_comp

/-- Chain rule for formal derivative of polynomials. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Derivative/Variant3f71d46892f3c6f5ee20cfc062652b6458ad8f82bf6cee82b1842b0ddc71a83b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Derivative/Variant3f71d46892f3c6f5ee20cfc062652b6458ad8f82bf6cee82b1842b0ddc71a83b.lean#L538).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fbf660a76a393947aa69c8343243d3d817fb5941` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
