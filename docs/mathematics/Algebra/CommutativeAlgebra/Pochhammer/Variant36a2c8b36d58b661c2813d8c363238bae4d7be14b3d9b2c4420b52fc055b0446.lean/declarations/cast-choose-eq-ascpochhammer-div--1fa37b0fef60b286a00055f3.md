## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d4a5b911-e3f4-5973-2a33-5e8b01f046a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 528–537.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cast_choose_eq_ascPochhammer_div (a b : ℕ) :
    (a.choose b : K) = (ascPochhammer K b).eval ↑(a - (b - 1)) / b ! := by
  rw [eq_div_iff_mul_eq (cast_ne_zero.2 b.factorial_ne_zero : (b ! : K) ≠ 0), ← cast_mul,
    mul_comm, ← descFactorial_eq_factorial_mul_choose, ← cast_descFactorial]

variable [DivisionRing K] [CharZero K]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Pochhammer/Variant36a2c8b36d58b661c2813d8c363238bae4d7be14b3d9b2c4420b52fc055b0446.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Pochhammer/Variant36a2c8b36d58b661c2813d8c363238bae4d7be14b3d9b2c4420b52fc055b0446.lean#L528).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `30a7dc5fa43bf3491b1a8b79afb762e553823b88` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
