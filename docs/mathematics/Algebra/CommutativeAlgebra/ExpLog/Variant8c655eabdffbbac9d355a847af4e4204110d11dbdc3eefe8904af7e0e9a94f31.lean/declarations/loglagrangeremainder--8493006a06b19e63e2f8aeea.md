## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:603c3756f982a01c36e98e72cbc2aaba9c926e9cc39469297d566cbc49a929a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 110–121.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def logLagrangeRemainder (domain : IntervalRat) (c : ℚ) (n : ℕ) : ℚ :=
  let r := max (|domain.lo - c|) (|domain.hi - c|)
  -- The (n+1)th derivative of log at ξ is (-1)^n * n! / ξ^(n+1)
  -- Lagrange remainder: |R_n| = |f^(n+1)(ξ)| / (n+1)! * |x-c|^(n+1)
  --                          = n! / ξ^(n+1) / (n+1)! * r^(n+1)
  --                          = 1 / [(n+1) * ξ^(n+1)] * r^(n+1)
  -- We bound by using min_ξ = domain.lo (assuming domain is positive)
  let min_xi := domain.lo
  if min_xi ≤ 0 then 1000  -- invalid domain, return large bound
  else r^(n+1) / ((n + 1) * min_xi^(n+1))

/-- Total remainder bound for log: Lagrange remainder + approximation error for log(c). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ExpLog/Variant8c655eabdffbbac9d355a847af4e4204110d11dbdc3eefe8904af7e0e9a94f31.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ExpLog/Variant8c655eabdffbbac9d355a847af4e4204110d11dbdc3eefe8904af7e0e9a94f31.lean#L110).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a1e41e733f1a16cd97715254de4b056b1744911a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
