## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b6488434cb9031ac4c729bd599961792be5aa86b3e5c716f8555f78c3c8a125a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def coshTaylorPoly (n : ℕ) : Polynomial ℚ :=
  ∑ i ∈ Finset.range (n + 1), Polynomial.C (coshTaylorCoeffs n i) * Polynomial.X ^ i

/-- Remainder bound for cosh: |cosh(x) - T_n(x)| ≤ cosh(r) * |x|^{n+1} / (n+1)!
    where r = max(|lo|, |hi|). We use cosh(r) ≤ exp(r) ≤ 3^(⌈r⌉+1). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Hyperbolic/Variant0e45cfe12d41633603c1ceda07f0ac70ee3b4b10bebf5fae1f73cdcd7c6e3974.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Hyperbolic/Variant0e45cfe12d41633603c1ceda07f0ac70ee3b4b10bebf5fae1f73cdcd7c6e3974.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c7aeee2aaf3c61bbb1db59f1c08119012d375839` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
