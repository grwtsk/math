## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d8af0c57-3bab-a7c9-3ada-5fe19c285b94`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 455–472.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private lemma twosComposition_unique (k : ℕ) (comp : Composition (2 * k))
    (hall : ∀ i, comp.blocksFun i = 2) : comp = twosComposition k := by
  ext1
  have hblocks : comp.blocks = List.replicate comp.length 2 := by
    apply List.ext_getElem
    · simp [Composition.blocks_length]
    · intro n h1 h2
      rw [List.getElem_replicate h2]
      have hi : n < comp.length := by rwa [← Composition.blocks_length]
      exact hall ⟨n, hi⟩
  have hlength : comp.length = k := by
    have hsum := comp.blocks_sum
    rw [hblocks] at hsum
    simp [List.sum_replicate] at hsum
    omega
  rw [hblocks, hlength]
  simp [twosComposition]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Hyperbolic/Varianta69d8b36f8ab49086a5444e1c3272ee1840e86905d6d3a64f36c18a12376f7df.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Hyperbolic/Varianta69d8b36f8ab49086a5444e1c3272ee1840e86905d6d3a64f36c18a12376f7df.lean#L455).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4340fe46dfba1e97488de14f88a8acf6b3d3cdcc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
