## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:69ca0033-8125-996e-a150-dbdb19079b43`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nonempty_algHom_of_range_minpoly_subset
    (h : Set.range (@minpoly F E _ _ _) ⊆ Set.range (@minpoly F K _ _ _)) :
    Nonempty (E →ₐ[F] K) :=
  nonempty_algHom_of_minpoly_eq fun x ↦ have ⟨y, hy⟩ := h ⟨x, rfl⟩; ⟨y, hy.symm⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Isaacs/Variant649f81f74b4032b7f5bec9d61118e04a78cacb6ec9ded106a87421a510c33ae1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Isaacs/Variant649f81f74b4032b7f5bec9d61118e04a78cacb6ec9ded106a87421a510c33ae1.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `177ad8abd5066537f6fe4cd80507c52d22cf5c93` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
