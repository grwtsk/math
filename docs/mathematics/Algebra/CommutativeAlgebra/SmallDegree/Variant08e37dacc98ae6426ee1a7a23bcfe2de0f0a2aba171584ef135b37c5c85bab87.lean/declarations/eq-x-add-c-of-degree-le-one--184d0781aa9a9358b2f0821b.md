## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7dce0f25-7b10-dcb2-3553-b7dd3f9a925d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 35–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_X_add_C_of_degree_le_one (h : degree p ≤ 1) : p = C (p.coeff 1) * X + C (p.coeff 0) :=
  ext fun n =>
    Nat.casesOn n (by simp) fun n =>
      Nat.casesOn n (by simp [coeff_C]) fun m => by
        -- Porting note: `by decide` → `Iff.mpr ..`
        have : degree p < m.succ.succ := lt_of_le_of_lt h
          (Iff.mpr WithBot.coe_lt_coe <| Nat.succ_lt_succ <| Nat.zero_lt_succ m)
        simp [coeff_eq_zero_of_degree_lt this, coeff_C, Nat.succ_ne_zero, coeff_X, Nat.succ_inj,
          @eq_comm ℕ 0]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/SmallDegree/Variant08e37dacc98ae6426ee1a7a23bcfe2de0f0a2aba171584ef135b37c5c85bab87.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/SmallDegree/Variant08e37dacc98ae6426ee1a7a23bcfe2de0f0a2aba171584ef135b37c5c85bab87.lean#L35).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `485d4681b1bd57d32bd44255f3cce3c960220f8a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
