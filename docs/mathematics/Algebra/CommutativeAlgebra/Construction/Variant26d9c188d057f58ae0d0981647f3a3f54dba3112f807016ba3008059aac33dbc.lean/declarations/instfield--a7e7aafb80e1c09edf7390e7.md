## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:51d065fcb1d794956d002037419393af2e17e9c7a997fc0839cc85a684e58f83`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 252–266.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instField : Field (SplittingField f) where
  __ := (inferInstance : CommRing (SplittingField f))
  __ := instGroupWithZero f
  nnratCast q := algebraMap K _ q
  ratCast q := algebraMap K _ q
  nnqsmul := (· • ·)
  qsmul := (· • ·)
  nnratCast_def q := by change algebraMap K _ _ = _; simp_rw [NNRat.cast_def, map_div₀, map_natCast]
  ratCast_def q := by
    change algebraMap K _ _ = _; rw [Rat.cast_def, map_div₀, map_intCast, map_natCast]
  nnqsmul_def q x := Quotient.inductionOn x fun p ↦ congr_arg Quotient.mk'' <| by
    ext; simp [MvPolynomial.algebraMap_eq, NNRat.smul_def]
  qsmul_def q x := Quotient.inductionOn x fun p ↦ congr_arg Quotient.mk'' <| by
    ext; simp [MvPolynomial.algebraMap_eq, Rat.smul_def]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Construction/Variant26d9c188d057f58ae0d0981647f3a3f54dba3112f807016ba3008059aac33dbc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Construction/Variant26d9c188d057f58ae0d0981647f3a3f54dba3112f807016ba3008059aac33dbc.lean#L252).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0fd60394cccf4618d01efbad3ab77ca6d6d4fd43` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
