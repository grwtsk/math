## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:be49bf8fdd17e8ec409f10c0a8b15be10dd3d4e3724e2b25c2f41ffd1368123e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 260–266.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isScalarTower {R : Type*} [CommSemiring R] [Algebra R K] :
    IsScalarTower R K (SplittingField f) :=
  Ideal.Quotient.isScalarTower _ _ _
#align polynomial.splitting_field.is_scalar_tower Polynomial.SplittingField.isScalarTower

/-- The algebra equivalence with `SplittingFieldAux`,
which we will use to construct the field structure. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Construction/Variantc3f9614f645eb4cd5bab8c1d2ef75778dce7c471478d39eb61c8aef19770ba97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Construction/Variantc3f9614f645eb4cd5bab8c1d2ef75778dce7c471478d39eb61c8aef19770ba97.lean#L260).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `813fa6d7de756ace5d965370c69d47a69cc03dc2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
