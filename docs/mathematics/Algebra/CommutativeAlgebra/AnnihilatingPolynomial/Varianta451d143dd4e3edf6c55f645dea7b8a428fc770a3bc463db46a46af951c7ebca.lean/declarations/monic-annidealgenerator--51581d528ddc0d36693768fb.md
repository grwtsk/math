## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d646b2d6-f340-3cfa-5aca-b99472ad0bdc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 119–129.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem monic_annIdealGenerator (a : A) (hg : annIdealGenerator 𝕜 a ≠ 0) :
    Monic (annIdealGenerator 𝕜 a) :=
  monic_mul_leadingCoeff_inv (mul_ne_zero_iff.mp hg).1

/-! We are working toward showing the generator of the annihilating ideal
in the field case is the minimal polynomial. We are going to use a uniqueness
theorem of the minimal polynomial.

This is the first condition: it must annihilate the original element `a : A`. -/


```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/AnnihilatingPolynomial/Varianta451d143dd4e3edf6c55f645dea7b8a428fc770a3bc463db46a46af951c7ebca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/AnnihilatingPolynomial/Varianta451d143dd4e3edf6c55f645dea7b8a428fc770a3bc463db46a46af951c7ebca.lean#L119).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4b89c6cde088164859ffa93bc5834fb6d5825d78` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
