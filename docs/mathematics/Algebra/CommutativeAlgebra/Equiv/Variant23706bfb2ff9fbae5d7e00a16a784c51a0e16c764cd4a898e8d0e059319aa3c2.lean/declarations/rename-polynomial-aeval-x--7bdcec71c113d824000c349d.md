## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3c68d0d3-d265-17aa-dbaa-97730b5630cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 875–887.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rename_polynomial_aeval_X {σ τ : Type*} (f : σ → τ) (i : σ) (p : R[X]) :
    rename f (Polynomial.aeval (X i) p) = Polynomial.aeval (X (f i) : MvPolynomial τ R) p := by
  rw [← aeval_algHom_apply, rename_X]

end Equiv

end MvPolynomial

variable {R S σ τ : Type*} [CommSemiring R] [CommSemiring S] [Algebra R S]

/-- The embedding of `R[X]` into `R[Xᵢ]` as an `R`-algebra homomorphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Equiv/Variant23706bfb2ff9fbae5d7e00a16a784c51a0e16c764cd4a898e8d0e059319aa3c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Equiv/Variant23706bfb2ff9fbae5d7e00a16a784c51a0e16c764cd4a898e8d0e059319aa3c2.lean#L875).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1548fce94216adf949c2926d361eec1200162586` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
