## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1b4ea48035c2cd5115651c70f6d1cd986bb9ef948b828e4823c9c6217880036b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 303–317.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mvPolynomialEquivMvPolynomial [CommSemiring S₃] (f : MvPolynomial S₁ R →+* MvPolynomial S₂ S₃)
    (g : MvPolynomial S₂ S₃ →+* MvPolynomial S₁ R) (hfgC : (f.comp g).comp C = C)
    (hfgX : ∀ n, f (g (X n)) = X n) (hgfC : (g.comp f).comp C = C) (hgfX : ∀ n, g (f (X n)) = X n) :
    MvPolynomial S₁ R ≃+* MvPolynomial S₂ S₃ where
  toFun := f
  invFun := g
  left_inv := is_id (RingHom.comp _ _) hgfC hgfX
  right_inv := is_id (RingHom.comp _ _) hfgC hfgX
  map_mul' := f.map_mul
  map_add' := f.map_add

/-- The ring isomorphism between multivariable polynomials in a sum of two types,
and multivariable polynomials in one of the types,
with coefficients in multivariable polynomials in the other type.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Equiv/Variant95d16cfe9945f3f4b9a39f83afcf3ffbf264c62fb3acaee53b8499dfd54960c0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Equiv/Variant95d16cfe9945f3f4b9a39f83afcf3ffbf264c62fb3acaee53b8499dfd54960c0.lean#L303).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fdfc975d04badb9226183345a7558ee477649af0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
