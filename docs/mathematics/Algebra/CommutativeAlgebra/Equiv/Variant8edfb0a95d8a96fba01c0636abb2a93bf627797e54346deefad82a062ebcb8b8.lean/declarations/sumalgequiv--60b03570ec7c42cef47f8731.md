## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0bfb7d38c804dacd52c1d3cf017b7fc0ffc7be7b06ec2ab429ad10301dea5885`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 275–293.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sumAlgEquiv : MvPolynomial (Sum S₁ S₂) R ≃ₐ[R] MvPolynomial S₁ (MvPolynomial S₂ R) :=
  { sumRingEquiv R S₁ S₂ with
    commutes' := by
      intro r
      have A : algebraMap R (MvPolynomial S₁ (MvPolynomial S₂ R)) r = (C (C r) : _) := by rfl
      have B : algebraMap R (MvPolynomial (Sum S₁ S₂) R) r = C r := by rfl
      simp only [sumRingEquiv, mvPolynomialEquivMvPolynomial, Equiv.toFun_as_coe_apply,
        Equiv.coe_fn_mk, B, sumToIter_C, A] }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Equiv/Variant8edfb0a95d8a96fba01c0636abb2a93bf627797e54346deefad82a062ebcb8b8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Equiv/Variant8edfb0a95d8a96fba01c0636abb2a93bf627797e54346deefad82a062ebcb8b8.lean#L275).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4e0c609a872b2a2bb5626ba04386d7e3f98ef8b9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
