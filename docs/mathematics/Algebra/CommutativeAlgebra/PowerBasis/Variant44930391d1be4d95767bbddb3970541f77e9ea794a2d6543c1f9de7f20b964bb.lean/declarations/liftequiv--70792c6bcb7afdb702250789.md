## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3c54756cf3dcad70b64b7c6d2c1334467b92f91a4d7fe49d93e6b7965c315c4c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 323–331.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def liftEquiv' [IsDomain B] (pb : PowerBasis A S) :
    (S →ₐ[A] B) ≃ { y : B // y ∈ (minpoly A pb.gen).aroots B } :=
  pb.liftEquiv.trans ((Equiv.refl _).subtypeEquiv fun x => by
    rw [Equiv.refl_apply, mem_roots_iff_aeval_eq_zero]
    · simp
    · exact map_monic_ne_zero (minpoly.monic pb.isIntegral_gen))

/-- There are finitely many algebra homomorphisms `S →ₐ[A] B` if `S` is of the form `A[x]`
and `B` is an integral domain. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/PowerBasis/Variant44930391d1be4d95767bbddb3970541f77e9ea794a2d6543c1f9de7f20b964bb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/PowerBasis/Variant44930391d1be4d95767bbddb3970541f77e9ea794a2d6543c1f9de7f20b964bb.lean#L323).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b63784ec36c83f49f337f05881089cdeab597c4c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
