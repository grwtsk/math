## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:608a10a9-c05e-3ca1-fed3-7fa1ff5dff60`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 421–434.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem equivOfMinpoly_symm (pb : PowerBasis A S) (pb' : PowerBasis A S')
    (h : minpoly A pb.gen = minpoly A pb'.gen) :
    (pb.equivOfMinpoly pb' h).symm = pb'.equivOfMinpoly pb h.symm :=
  rfl
#align power_basis.equiv_of_minpoly_symm PowerBasis.equivOfMinpoly_symm

end Equiv

end PowerBasis

open PowerBasis

/-- Useful lemma to show `x` generates a power basis:
the powers of `x` less than the degree of `x`'s minimal polynomial are linearly independent. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/PowerBasis/Variant1b287bd5fc8cc476c8a9132260b2e7220ac450dc3e1f9ffd2b3d80abee9b68e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/PowerBasis/Variant1b287bd5fc8cc476c8a9132260b2e7220ac450dc3e1f9ffd2b3d80abee9b68e7.lean#L421).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `793eb36b4907170e6f62daefcbad72b68b648852` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
