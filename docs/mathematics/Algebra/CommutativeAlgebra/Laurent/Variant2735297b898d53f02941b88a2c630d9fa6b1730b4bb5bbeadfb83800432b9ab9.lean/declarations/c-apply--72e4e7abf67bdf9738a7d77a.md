## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:79f2a630-4748-4611-bf28-a44be71d536d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 152–159.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma C_apply (t : R) (n : ℤ) : C t n = if n = 0 then t else 0 := by
  rw [← single_eq_C, Finsupp.single_apply]; aesop

/-- The function `n ↦ T ^ n`, implemented as a sequence `ℤ → R[T;T⁻¹]`.

Using directly `T ^ n` does not work, since we want the exponents to be of Type `ℤ` and there
is no `ℤ`-power defined on `R[T;T⁻¹]`.  Using that `T` is a unit introduces extra coercions.
For these reasons, the definition of `T` is as a sequence. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Laurent/Variant2735297b898d53f02941b88a2c630d9fa6b1730b4bb5bbeadfb83800432b9ab9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Laurent/Variant2735297b898d53f02941b88a2c630d9fa6b1730b4bb5bbeadfb83800432b9ab9.lean#L152).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1470eaf61b57ef16ac03cdbe8aca0cbaeac509bd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
