## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ec593beb-f59d-69f1-68ef-9906b7444c11`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 463–472.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem support_C_mul_T_of_ne_zero {a : R} (a0 : a ≠ 0) (n : ℤ) :
    Finsupp.support (C a * T n) = {n} := by
  rw [← single_eq_C_mul_T]
  exact support_single_ne_zero _ a0
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align laurent_polynomial.support_C_mul_T_of_ne_zero LaurentPolynomial.support_C_mul_T_of_ne_zero

/-- The support of a polynomial `f` is a finset in `ℕ`.  The lemma `toLaurent_support f`
shows that the support of `f.toLaurent` is the same finset, but viewed in `ℤ` under the natural
inclusion `ℕ ↪ ℤ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Laurent/Variantcfdb6a3feb8ac939462596f168db309c7430045e6d51e7ca55a17ad67a8f8b18.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Laurent/Variantcfdb6a3feb8ac939462596f168db309c7430045e6d51e7ca55a17ad67a8f8b18.lean#L463).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `abe8cce865907a90fbf339b97052164e8cfc3f52` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
