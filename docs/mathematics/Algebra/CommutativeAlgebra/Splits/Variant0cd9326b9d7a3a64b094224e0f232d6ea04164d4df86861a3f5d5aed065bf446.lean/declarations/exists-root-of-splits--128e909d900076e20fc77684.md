## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:73adcc67-f2ad-36cc-3ee4-6cb8f72dae44`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 215–226.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_root_of_splits' {f : K[X]} (hs : Splits i f) (hf0 : degree (f.map i) ≠ 0) :
    ∃ x, eval₂ i x f = 0 :=
  letI := Classical.decEq L
  if hf0' : f.map i = 0 then by simp [eval₂_eq_eval_map, hf0']
  else
    let ⟨g, hg⟩ :=
      WfDvdMonoid.exists_irreducible_factor
        (show ¬IsUnit (f.map i) from mt isUnit_iff_degree_eq_zero.1 hf0) hf0'
    let ⟨x, hx⟩ := exists_root_of_degree_eq_one (hs.resolve_left hf0' hg.1 hg.2)
    let ⟨i, hi⟩ := hg.2
    ⟨x, by rw [← eval_map, hi, eval_mul, show _ = _ from hx, zero_mul]⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Splits/Variant0cd9326b9d7a3a64b094224e0f232d6ea04164d4df86861a3f5d5aed065bf446.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Splits/Variant0cd9326b9d7a3a64b094224e0f232d6ea04164d4df86861a3f5d5aed065bf446.lean#L215).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `61222c34d711a75795177d2cec192cc25f3eb2e9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
