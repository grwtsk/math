## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ccdb800a-6005-8f4a-8274-354343f3477b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 227–241.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma addPolynomial_eq (x y ℓ : R) : W'.addPolynomial x y ℓ = -Cubic.toPoly
    ⟨1, -ℓ ^ 2 - W'.a₁ * ℓ + W'.a₂,
      2 * x * ℓ ^ 2 + (W'.a₁ * x - 2 * y - W'.a₃) * ℓ + (-W'.a₁ * y + W'.a₄),
      -x ^ 2 * ℓ ^ 2 + (2 * x * y + W'.a₃ * x) * ℓ - (y ^ 2 + W'.a₃ * y - W'.a₆)⟩ := by

/-- The `X`-coordinate of `(x₁, y₁) + (x₂, y₂)` for two nonsingular affine points `(x₁, y₁)` and
`(x₂, y₂)` on a Weierstrass curve `W`, where the line through them has a slope of `ℓ`.

This depends on `W`, and has argument order: `x₁`, `x₂`, `ℓ`. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Formula/Variant4d9720e3db54b9b7130452dae4dd58fdf845e10456360baed0506c853c5a5234.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Formula/Variant4d9720e3db54b9b7130452dae4dd58fdf845e10456360baed0506c853c5a5234.lean#L227).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0887288f951fa0f4116a6c84ea70875f0406d66f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
