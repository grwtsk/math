## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:67dcf261cbe899804b1256b84c22a011b30f86c27b5b734c8a62aaa9eca2d18d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 166–182.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def linePolynomial (x y ℓ : R) : R[X] :=
  C ℓ * (X - C x) + C y

section slope

variable [DecidableEq F]

variable (W) in
/-- The slope of the line through two nonsingular affine points `(x₁, y₁)` and `(x₂, y₂)` on a
Weierstrass curve `W`.

If `x₁ ≠ x₂`, then this line is the secant of `W` through `(x₁, y₁)` and `(x₂, y₂)`, and has slope
`(y₁ - y₂) / (x₁ - x₂)`. Otherwise, if `y₁ ≠ -y₁ - a₁x₁ - a₃`, then this line is the tangent of `W`
at `(x₁, y₁) = (x₂, y₂)`, and has slope `(3x₁² + 2a₂x₁ + a₄ - a₁y₁) / (2y₁ + a₁x₁ + a₃)`. Otherwise,
this line is vertical, in which case this returns the value `0`.

This depends on `W`, and has argument order: `x₁`, `x₂`, `y₁`, `y₂`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Formula/Variant902a129ebc0f0ed88cf7f2afbd8eb0590d1982e8f1a8e06c66bcc0d6c910b5ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Formula/Variant902a129ebc0f0ed88cf7f2afbd8eb0590d1982e8f1a8e06c66bcc0d6c910b5ae.lean#L166).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac1a2b808a3acc5a302c8bdf8afbeceddef9d6a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
