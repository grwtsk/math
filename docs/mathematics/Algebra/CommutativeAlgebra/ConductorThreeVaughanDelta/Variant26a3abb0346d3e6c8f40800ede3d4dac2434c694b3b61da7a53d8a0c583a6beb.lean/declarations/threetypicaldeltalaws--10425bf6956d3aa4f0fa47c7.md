## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:179ed7fbc0c6e428f2e5ee5e5ddc8477c98f4155b4efa9bbc23a49e1e25d9b4f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 64–80.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ThreeTypicalDeltaLaws
    (A : Type*) [CommRing A]
    (operation : ThreeTypicalDeltaOperation A) : Prop where
  delta_zero : operation.delta 0 = 0
  delta_one : operation.delta 1 = 0
  delta_add : ∀ a b,
    operation.delta (a + b) =
      operation.delta a + operation.delta b - a ^ 2 * b - a * b ^ 2
  delta_mul : ∀ a b,
    operation.delta (a * b) =
      a ^ 3 * operation.delta b + b ^ 3 * operation.delta a +
        3 * operation.delta a * operation.delta b

/-- A certified `p = 3` delta-ring structure.

This is intentionally the algebraic structure only.  It contains no prism
ideal, completeness, topology, filtration, or Archimedean norm. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ConductorThreeVaughanDelta/Variant26a3abb0346d3e6c8f40800ede3d4dac2434c694b3b61da7a53d8a0c583a6beb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ConductorThreeVaughanDelta/Variant26a3abb0346d3e6c8f40800ede3d4dac2434c694b3b61da7a53d8a0c583a6beb.lean#L64).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2fd913c572bfc9e159bf1c868b98c567e0c22f27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
