## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1bc60aa8aaa6689a16bad3558f5dfe29b6855dcb482057598a53cfeebff0aa45`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 51–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ThreeTypicalDeltaOperation (A : Type*) [CommRing A] where
  delta : A → A
  phi : A →+* A
  phi_apply : ∀ a, phi a = a ^ 3 + (3 : A) * delta a

/-- The explicit `p = 3` p-derivation laws associated to an operation-level
Frobenius lift.

The additive correction is
`-a²b - ab²`, and the multiplicative correction is
`a³δ(b) + b³δ(a) + 3δ(a)δ(b)`.  Keeping this as a separate proof
bundle lets a consumer distinguish a bare displayed Frobenius formula from a
fully certified three-typical delta operation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ConductorThreeVaughanDelta/Variant95a85ced57eae1207957edccc2b277bc9ea7b8a0195c51cd96afa95a74b299c4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ConductorThreeVaughanDelta/Variant95a85ced57eae1207957edccc2b277bc9ea7b8a0195c51cd96afa95a74b299c4.lean#L51).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `14ebf711ef62d8e0f0b4c76ab0a20c2badc52048` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
