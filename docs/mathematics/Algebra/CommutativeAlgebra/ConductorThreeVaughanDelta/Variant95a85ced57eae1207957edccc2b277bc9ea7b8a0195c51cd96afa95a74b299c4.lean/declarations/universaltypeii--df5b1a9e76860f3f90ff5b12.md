## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8d269d5f304bfa74f8854d34e4127d0a77930b3e7c66621a2280d7e91cc28976`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 298–309.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def universalTypeII {N : ℕ}
    (base : DeltaTypeIICoefficientBase N)
    (x : VaughanScaleIndex N) : base.A :=
  ∑ n : Fin (x.1 + 1),
    ∑ a : VaughanTypeIIFactorAtom N,
      if vaughanTypeIIFactorIndex a = prefixIndex x n then
        -(base.leftVariable a.1.1 * base.rightVariable a.1.2)
      else 0

/-- Evaluation of one universal moment fiber is the exact Type II component
of the checked twisted Vaughan identity. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ConductorThreeVaughanDelta/Variant95a85ced57eae1207957edccc2b277bc9ea7b8a0195c51cd96afa95a74b299c4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ConductorThreeVaughanDelta/Variant95a85ced57eae1207957edccc2b277bc9ea7b8a0195c51cd96afa95a74b299c4.lean#L298).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `14ebf711ef62d8e0f0b4c76ab0a20c2badc52048` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
