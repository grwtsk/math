## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c63818bd-cc42-ddce-9c68-8408a4e150d6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 128–139.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rename_surjective (f : σ → τ) (hf : Function.Surjective f) :
    Function.Surjective (rename f : MvPolynomial σ R → MvPolynomial τ R) :=
  let ⟨_, hf⟩ := hf.hasRightInverse; rename_rightInverse hf |>.surjective

section

variable {f : σ → τ} (hf : Function.Injective f) {p : MvPolynomial τ R}

open scoped Classical in
/-- Given a function between sets of variables `f : σ → τ` that is injective with proof `hf`,
  `MvPolynomial.killCompl hf` is the `AlgHom` from `R[τ]` to `R[σ]` that is left inverse to
  `rename f : R[σ] → R[τ]` and sends the variables in the complement of the range of `f` to `0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Rename/Variant5e0347c59ad485d96d21f1ed580716ffce65f89f796f25c91dd6957f53493146.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Rename/Variant5e0347c59ad485d96d21f1ed580716ffce65f89f796f25c91dd6957f53493146.lean#L128).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ae23a9ffa0fbeae21e3557243c178bc58766e719` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
