## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ad101173-0b57-fef9-5b80-4e7476f964d9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 262–277.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_finset_rename₂ (p₁ p₂ : MvPolynomial σ R) :
    ∃ (s : Finset σ) (q₁ q₂ : MvPolynomial s R), p₁ = rename (↑) q₁ ∧ p₂ = rename (↑) q₂ := by
  obtain ⟨s₁, q₁, rfl⟩ := exists_finset_rename p₁
  obtain ⟨s₂, q₂, rfl⟩ := exists_finset_rename p₂
  classical
    use s₁ ∪ s₂
    use rename (Set.inclusion <| s₁.subset_union_left s₂) q₁
    use rename (Set.inclusion <| s₁.subset_union_right s₂) q₂
    constructor -- porting note: was `<;> simp <;> rfl` but Lean couldn't infer the arguments

    · rw [rename_rename (Set.inclusion <| s₁.subset_union_right s₂)]
      rfl

/-- Every polynomial is a polynomial in finitely many variables. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Rename/Variantd9ac61f2a042092653060691b9c3d95d4ee9c3a515907ecbdd555b3d575f3cde.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Rename/Variantd9ac61f2a042092653060691b9c3d95d4ee9c3a515907ecbdd555b3d575f3cde.lean#L262).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0f933326fb4d67a9271b91bef8df1d969a29e1a5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
