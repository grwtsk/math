## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2e995e0bea126b4e6f46f2f7f22507d92df3ce9491813222386cc55776e12680`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 238–246.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : CommRing (𝕎 R) :=
  (mapFun.surjective _ <| counit_surjective _).commRing (mapFun <| MvPolynomial.counit _)
    (mapFun.zero _) (mapFun.one _) (mapFun.add _) (mapFun.mul _) (mapFun.neg _) (mapFun.sub _)
    (mapFun.nsmul _) (mapFun.zsmul _) (mapFun.pow _) (mapFun.natCast _) (mapFun.intCast _)

variable {p R}

/-- `WittVector.map f` is the ring homomorphism `𝕎 R →+* 𝕎 S` naturally induced
by a ring homomorphism `f : R →+* S`. It acts coefficientwise. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variantc93cd512f48dc94b6e09230eb5d1962a37a73cc62708d78ffb60e6e45f42b410.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variantc93cd512f48dc94b6e09230eb5d1962a37a73cc62708d78ffb60e6e45f42b410.lean#L238).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3e1aab7da8b6a1818d9b96eee5b42a81c9d49d52` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
