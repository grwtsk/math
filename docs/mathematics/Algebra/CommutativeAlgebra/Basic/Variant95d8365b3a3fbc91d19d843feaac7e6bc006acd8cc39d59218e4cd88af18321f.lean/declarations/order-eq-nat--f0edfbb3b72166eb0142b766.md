## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:874d3825-c65e-013d-516b-5dc8580b9c98`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2308–2316.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem order_eq_nat {φ : PowerSeries R} {n : ℕ} :
    order φ = n ↔ coeff R n φ ≠ 0 ∧ ∀ i, i < n → coeff R i φ = 0 := by
  rcases eq_or_ne φ 0 with (rfl | hφ)
  · simpa using (PartENat.natCast_ne_top _).symm
  simp [order, dif_neg hφ, Nat.find_eq_iff]
#align power_series.order_eq_nat PowerSeries.order_eq_nat

/-- The order of a formal power series is exactly `n` if the `n`th coefficient is nonzero,
and the `i`th coefficient is `0` for all `i < n`.-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variant95d8365b3a3fbc91d19d843feaac7e6bc006acd8cc39d59218e4cd88af18321f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variant95d8365b3a3fbc91d19d843feaac7e6bc006acd8cc39d59218e4cd88af18321f.lean#L2308).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bfdc8f72082525c52f1fe03aa34cc279cb8e9735` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
