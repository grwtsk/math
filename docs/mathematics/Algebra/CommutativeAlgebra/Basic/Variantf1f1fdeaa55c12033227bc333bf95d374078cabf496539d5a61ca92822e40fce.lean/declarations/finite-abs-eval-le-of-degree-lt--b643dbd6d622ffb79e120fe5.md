## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0fc0a275-d788-1e04-789c-afde6d75b36d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 362–371.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma finite_abs_eval_le_of_degree_lt {P Q : ℤ[X]} (h : Q.degree < P.degree) :
    {x | |P.eval x| ≤ |Q.eval x|}.Finite := by
  have o := isLittleO_cobounded_of_degree_lt h
  rw [IsOrderBornology.cobounded_eq, ← Int.cofinite_eq] at o
  have nr := eventually_cofinite_not_isRoot (ne_zero_of_degree_gt h)
  have key := o.eventuallyLT_norm_of_eventually_pos (nr.congr (.of_forall (by simp)))
  simp_rw [eventually_cofinite, not_lt, Int.norm_eq_abs] at key
  norm_cast at key

/-- If `Q(x) ∣ P(x)` at infinitely many integers `x` and `Q` is monic, `Q ∣ P`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variantf1f1fdeaa55c12033227bc333bf95d374078cabf496539d5a61ca92822e40fce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variantf1f1fdeaa55c12033227bc333bf95d374078cabf496539d5a61ca92822e40fce.lean#L362).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a1bb42a81bff9caf112db484783f6489fbf4867f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
