## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4244b95a-2baa-ccb5-f53c-6722d517c411`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 619–627.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem finiteDimensional_adjoin {S : Set L} [Finite S] (hS : ∀ x ∈ S, IsIntegral K x) :
    FiniteDimensional K (adjoin K S) := by
  rw [← biSup_adjoin_simple, ← iSup_subtype'']
  have (x : S) := adjoin.finiteDimensional (hS x.1 x.2)
  exact finiteDimensional_iSup_of_finite

/-- If `x` generates `L` over `K` (i.e., `K⟮x⟯ = ⊤`) and is integral over `K`, then `x`
defines a `PowerBasis` for `L` over `K`. See `PowerBasis.ofAdjoinEqTop` for a version with
`Algebra.adjoin`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variant4d6ca04826f15d12527a5611ad06a3c35260d59b408e6312680d115b02fdf2cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variant4d6ca04826f15d12527a5611ad06a3c35260d59b408e6312680d115b02fdf2cb.lean#L619).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `817fc7e1a7b4a19ad7809ff35259525b53f7b71e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
