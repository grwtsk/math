## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e8001c97-820e-b19d-83c4-7eff088f3426`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 177–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_degree_le_of_mem_span {s : Set R[X]} {p : R[X]}
    (hs : s.Nonempty) (hp : p ∈ Submodule.span R s) :
    ∃ p' ∈ s, degree p ≤ degree p' := by
  by_contra! h
  by_cases hp_zero : p = 0
  · rw [hp_zero, degree_zero] at h
    rcases hs with ⟨x, hx⟩
    exact not_lt_bot (h x hx)
  · have : p ∈ degreeLT R (natDegree p) := by
      refine (Submodule.span_le.mpr fun p' p'_mem => ?_) hp
      rw [SetLike.mem_coe, mem_degreeLT, Nat.cast_withBot]
      exact lt_of_lt_of_le (h p' p'_mem) degree_le_natDegree
    rwa [mem_degreeLT, Nat.cast_withBot, degree_eq_natDegree hp_zero,
      Nat.cast_withBot, lt_self_iff_false] at this

/-- A stronger version of `Polynomial.exists_degree_le_of_mem_span` under the assumption that the
set `s : R[X]` is finite. There exists a polynomial `p' ∈ s` whose degree dominates the degree of
every element of `p ∈ span R s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variantc3b3af2cd45158245b901152c946031d60f2515e8d20b6c2c9a3fc3fe289d66e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variantc3b3af2cd45158245b901152c946031d60f2515e8d20b6c2c9a3fc3fe289d66e.lean#L177).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f4e78e4f0790433c5783700db0206dfab2212462` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
