## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:225a086f-3099-d03c-09b1-373e96de38ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 376–393.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem induction_on'' {motive : MvPolynomial σ R → Prop} (p : MvPolynomial σ R)
    (C : ∀ a, motive (C a))
    (monomial_add :
      ∀ (a : σ →₀ ℕ) (b : R) (f : MvPolynomial σ R),
        a ∉ f.coeff.support → b ≠ 0 → motive f → motive (monomial a b) →
          motive ((monomial a b) + f))
    (mul_X : ∀ (p : MvPolynomial σ R) (n : σ), motive p → motive (p * MvPolynomial.X n)) :
    motive p :=
  monomial_add_induction_on p C fun a b f ha hb hf =>
    monomial_add a b f ha hb hf <| induction_on_monomial C mul_X a b

/--
Analog of `Polynomial.induction_on`.
If a property holds for any constant polynomial
and is preserved under addition and multiplication by variables
then it holds for all multivariate polynomials.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variant6aae493483420efb0809b1ec7823d91d4eefda3493dabc74b390cc983996c225.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variant6aae493483420efb0809b1ec7823d91d4eefda3493dabc74b390cc983996c225.lean#L376).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d0d47e09a9ebac442d472b1e4aca5dd6045fca98` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
