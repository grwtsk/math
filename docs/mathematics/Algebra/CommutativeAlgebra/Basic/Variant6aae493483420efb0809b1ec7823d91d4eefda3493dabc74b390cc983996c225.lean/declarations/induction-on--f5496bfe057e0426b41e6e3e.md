## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b23b6714-9f1d-37a7-72f2-f311f9acb2d4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 348–361.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem induction_on' {P : MvPolynomial σ R → Prop} (p : MvPolynomial σ R)
    (monomial : ∀ (u : σ →₀ ℕ) (a : R), P (monomial u a))
    (add : ∀ p q : MvPolynomial σ R, P p → P q → P (p + q)) : P p :=
  induction p
    (suffices P (MvPolynomial.monomial 0 0) by rwa [monomial_zero] at this
    show P (MvPolynomial.monomial 0 0) from monomial 0 0)
    fun _ _ _ _ha _hb hPf => add _ _ (monomial _ _) hPf

/--
Similar to `MvPolynomial.induction_on` but only a weak form of `h_add` is required.
In particular, this version only requires us to show
that `motive` is closed under addition of nontrivial monomials not present in the support.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variant6aae493483420efb0809b1ec7823d91d4eefda3493dabc74b390cc983996c225.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variant6aae493483420efb0809b1ec7823d91d4eefda3493dabc74b390cc983996c225.lean#L348).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d0d47e09a9ebac442d472b1e4aca5dd6045fca98` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
