## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eb6ffab3-7452-ab9b-ad80-53bef251e232`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–96.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coeff_hermite_of_lt {n k : ℕ} (hnk : n < k) : coeff (hermite n) k = 0 := by
  obtain ⟨k, rfl⟩ := Nat.exists_eq_add_of_lt hnk
  clear hnk
  induction n generalizing k with
  | zero => exact coeff_C
  | succ n ih =>
    have : n + k + 1 + 2 = n + (k + 2) + 1 := by ring
    rw [coeff_hermite_succ_succ, add_right_comm, this, ih k, ih (k + 2), mul_zero, sub_zero]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variantbfddf95890c4703e65c00d16691784c2b724aa44a80bae1860d82e2cde3bdb41.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variantbfddf95890c4703e65c00d16691784c2b724aa44a80bae1860d82e2cde3bdb41.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ef1eb2aa739295c3bc4db5902df0af1ed27c1f6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
