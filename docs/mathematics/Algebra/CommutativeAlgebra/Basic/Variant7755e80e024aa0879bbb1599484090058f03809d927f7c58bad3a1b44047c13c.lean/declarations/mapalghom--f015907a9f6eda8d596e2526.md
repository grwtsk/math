## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5573df2e4d6f8de5eb61b9528f91b92192253cda9c16310bdfaf11a320c762ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1423–1435.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mapAlgHom [CommSemiring S₂] [Algebra R S₁] [Algebra R S₂] (f : S₁ →ₐ[R] S₂) :
    MvPolynomial σ S₁ →ₐ[R] MvPolynomial σ S₂ :=
  { map (↑f : S₁ →+* S₂) with
    commutes' := fun r => by
      have h₁ : algebraMap R (MvPolynomial σ S₁) r = C (algebraMap R S₁ r) := rfl
      have h₂ : algebraMap R (MvPolynomial σ S₂) r = C (algebraMap R S₂ r) := rfl
      simp_rw [OneHom.toFun_eq_coe]
      -- porting note: we're missing some `simp` lemmas like `MonoidHom.coe_toOneHom`
      change @FunLike.coe (_ →+* _) _ _ _ _ _ = _
      rw [h₁, h₂, map, eval₂Hom_C, RingHom.comp_apply, AlgHom.coe_toRingHom, AlgHom.commutes] }
#align mv_polynomial.map_alg_hom MvPolynomial.mapAlgHom

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variant7755e80e024aa0879bbb1599484090058f03809d927f7c58bad3a1b44047c13c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variant7755e80e024aa0879bbb1599484090058f03809d927f7c58bad3a1b44047c13c.lean#L1423).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `849009648828f5b2ab8d7c89e4122865246e04b4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
