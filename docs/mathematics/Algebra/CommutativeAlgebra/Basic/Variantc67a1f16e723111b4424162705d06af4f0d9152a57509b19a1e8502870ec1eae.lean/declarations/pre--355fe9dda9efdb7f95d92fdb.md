## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d813bda057112864010228de174b4a27c9aae4a761f2e2b4db9c702eda234fb3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 151–156.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def preΨ₄ : R[X] :=
  2 * X ^ 6 + C W.b₂ * X ^ 5 + 5 * C W.b₄ * X ^ 4 + 10 * C W.b₆ * X ^ 3 + 10 * C W.b₈ * X ^ 2 +
    C (W.b₂ * W.b₈ - W.b₄ * W.b₆) * X + C (W.b₄ * W.b₈ - W.b₆ ^ 2)

/-- The univariate polynomials `preΨₙ` for `n ∈ ℕ`, which are auxiliary to the bivariate polynomials
`Ψₙ` congruent to the bivariate `n`-division polynomials `ψₙ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variantc67a1f16e723111b4424162705d06af4f0d9152a57509b19a1e8502870ec1eae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variantc67a1f16e723111b4424162705d06af4f0d9152a57509b19a1e8502870ec1eae.lean#L151).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `deaf84f035f9a609334ae5561fcb0c233e5ef4be` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
