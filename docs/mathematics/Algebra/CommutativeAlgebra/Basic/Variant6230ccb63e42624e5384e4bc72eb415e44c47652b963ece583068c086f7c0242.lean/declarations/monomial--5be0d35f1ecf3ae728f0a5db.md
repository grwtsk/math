## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4a0d8a2235bb68be4767c993023159b0d3f658ff37f4315264c04ffeb51db8c1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 392–399.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def monomial (n : ℕ) : R →ₗ[R] R[X] where
  toFun t := ⟨Finsupp.single n t⟩
  -- Porting note (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/10745): was `simp`.
  map_add' x y := by simp; rw [ofFinsupp_add]
  -- Porting note (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/10745): was `simp [← ofFinsupp_smul]`.
  map_smul' r x := by simp; rw [← ofFinsupp_smul, smul_single']

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variant6230ccb63e42624e5384e4bc72eb415e44c47652b963ece583068c086f7c0242.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Basic/Variant6230ccb63e42624e5384e4bc72eb415e44c47652b963ece583068c086f7c0242.lean#L392).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `563df7125dcee4d95384610e7ab76322cac426b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
