## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:07ba754f-0c0f-4278-794b-5b53303e9ed1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 147–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasseDeriv_X (hk : 1 < k) : hasseDeriv k (X : R[X]) = 0 := by
  rw [← monomial_one_one_eq_X, hasseDeriv_monomial, Nat.choose_eq_zero_of_lt hk, Nat.cast_zero,
    zero_mul, monomial_zero_right]
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align polynomial.hasse_deriv_X Polynomial.hasseDeriv_X

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/HasseDeriv/Variant12846972ac2be4d2237e14bb3e2ddc73bc4658a25ca64bbd8b6676c53e9047a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/HasseDeriv/Variant12846972ac2be4d2237e14bb3e2ddc73bc4658a25ca64bbd8b6676c53e9047a6.lean#L147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `02290cc27be24a51a384a41e62339e1f538e9292` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
