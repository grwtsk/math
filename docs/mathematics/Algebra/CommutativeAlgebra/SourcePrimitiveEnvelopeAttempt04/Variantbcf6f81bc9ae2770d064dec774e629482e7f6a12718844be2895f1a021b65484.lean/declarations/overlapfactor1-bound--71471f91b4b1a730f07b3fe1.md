## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c1948ecd-8b69-8fbc-c2ff-8139eddcc333`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 41–50.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem overlapFactor1_bound {u : ℝ} (hu : u∈Icc (0:ℝ) 2) :
    overlapFactor1 u≤164736 := by
  have h0 : 0≤u := hu.1
  have h2 : u≤2 := hu.2
  have hp : overlapFactor1 u≤overlapFactor1 2 := by
    unfold overlapFactor1
    gcongr
  norm_num [overlapFactor1] at hp
  exact hp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/SourcePrimitiveEnvelopeAttempt04/Variantbcf6f81bc9ae2770d064dec774e629482e7f6a12718844be2895f1a021b65484.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/SourcePrimitiveEnvelopeAttempt04/Variantbcf6f81bc9ae2770d064dec774e629482e7f6a12718844be2895f1a021b65484.lean#L41).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3dc09c90875c22a5e286279676477cf97a61c2ae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
