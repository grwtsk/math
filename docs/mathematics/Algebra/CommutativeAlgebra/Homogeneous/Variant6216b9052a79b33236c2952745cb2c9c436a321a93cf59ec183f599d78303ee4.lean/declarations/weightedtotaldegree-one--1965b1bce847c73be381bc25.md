## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a3dd0df8-c40b-65fc-0621-5fda2e3bee81`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 70–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem weightedTotalDegree_one (φ : MvPolynomial σ R) :
    weightedTotalDegree (1 : σ → ℕ) φ = φ.totalDegree := by
  simp only [totalDegree, weightedTotalDegree, weight, LinearMap.toAddMonoidHom_coe,
    linearCombination, Pi.one_apply, Finsupp.coe_lsum, LinearMap.coe_smulRight, LinearMap.id_coe,
    id, smul_eq_mul, mul_one]

/-- The `degreeOf` a variable `i` for a polynomial `p` is a special case of the
  `weightedTotalDegree` of `p` where `i` has the only nonzero weight and that weight is `1`. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Homogeneous/Variant6216b9052a79b33236c2952745cb2c9c436a321a93cf59ec183f599d78303ee4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Homogeneous/Variant6216b9052a79b33236c2952745cb2c9c436a321a93cf59ec183f599d78303ee4.lean#L70).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3cc1e1350ebe2badf24fe982c2f16290f8aeb006` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
