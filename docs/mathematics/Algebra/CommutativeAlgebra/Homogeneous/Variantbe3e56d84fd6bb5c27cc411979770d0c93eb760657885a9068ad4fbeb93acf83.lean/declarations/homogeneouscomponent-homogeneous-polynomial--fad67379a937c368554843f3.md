## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e8ed3195-54d0-544e-284a-a1a0175d336f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 322–341.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem homogeneousComponent_homogeneous_polynomial (m n : ℕ) (p : MvPolynomial σ R)
    (h : p ∈ homogeneousSubmodule σ R n) : homogeneousComponent m p = if m = n then p else 0 := by
  simp only [mem_homogeneousSubmodule] at h
  ext x
  rw [coeff_homogeneousComponent]
  by_cases zero_coeff : coeff x p = 0

    split_ifs with h1
    · rfl
    · simp only [coeff_zero]
#align mv_polynomial.homogeneous_component_homogeneous_polynomial MvPolynomial.homogeneousComponent_homogeneous_polynomial

end HomogeneousComponent

end

end MvPolynomial
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Homogeneous/Variantbe3e56d84fd6bb5c27cc411979770d0c93eb760657885a9068ad4fbeb93acf83.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Homogeneous/Variantbe3e56d84fd6bb5c27cc411979770d0c93eb760657885a9068ad4fbeb93acf83.lean#L322).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b25e34205da9092f778d5fdcf86f94fa1095309f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
