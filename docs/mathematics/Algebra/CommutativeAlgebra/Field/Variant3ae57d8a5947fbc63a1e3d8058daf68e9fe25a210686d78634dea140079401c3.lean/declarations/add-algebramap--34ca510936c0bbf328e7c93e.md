## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:af662c52-ca2b-f63f-de04-10d90d85df45`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 152–165.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem add_algebraMap {B : Type*} [CommRing B] [Algebra A B] {x : B} (hx : IsIntegral A x)
    (a : A) : minpoly A (x + algebraMap A B a) = (minpoly A x).comp (X - C a) := by
  refine' (minpoly.unique _ _ ((minpoly.monic hx).comp_X_sub_C _) _ fun q qmo hq => _).symm
  · simp [aeval_comp]
  · have : (Polynomial.aeval x) (q.comp (X + C a)) = 0 := by simpa [aeval_comp] using hq
    have H := minpoly.min A x (qmo.comp_X_add_C _) this
    rw [degree_eq_natDegree qmo.ne_zero,
      degree_eq_natDegree ((minpoly.monic hx).comp_X_sub_C _).ne_zero, natDegree_comp,
      natDegree_X_sub_C, mul_one]
    rwa [degree_eq_natDegree (minpoly.ne_zero hx),
      degree_eq_natDegree (qmo.comp_X_add_C _).ne_zero, natDegree_comp,
      natDegree_X_add_C, mul_one] at H
#align minpoly.add_algebra_map minpoly.add_algebraMap

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Field/Variant3ae57d8a5947fbc63a1e3d8058daf68e9fe25a210686d78634dea140079401c3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Field/Variant3ae57d8a5947fbc63a1e3d8058daf68e9fe25a210686d78634dea140079401c3.lean#L152).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ed160a8adf6b568dac7873d92ffde3e4c9efbb9c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
