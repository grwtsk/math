## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a4056868-a233-730b-cb1f-8849e56bc0df`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 119–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_of_irreducible_of_monic [Nontrivial B] {p : A[X]} (hp1 : Irreducible p)
    (hp2 : Polynomial.aeval x p = 0) (hp3 : p.Monic) : p = minpoly A x :=
  let ⟨_, hq⟩ := dvd A x hp2
  eq_of_monic_of_associated hp3 (monic ⟨p, ⟨hp3, hp2⟩⟩) <|
    mul_one (minpoly A x) ▸ hq.symm ▸ Associated.mul_left _
      (associated_one_iff_isUnit.2 <| (hp1.isUnit_or_isUnit hq).resolve_left <| not_isUnit A x)
#align minpoly.eq_of_irreducible_of_monic minpoly.eq_of_irreducible_of_monic

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Field/Variant3ae57d8a5947fbc63a1e3d8058daf68e9fe25a210686d78634dea140079401c3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Field/Variant3ae57d8a5947fbc63a1e3d8058daf68e9fe25a210686d78634dea140079401c3.lean#L119).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ed160a8adf6b568dac7873d92ffde3e4c9efbb9c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
