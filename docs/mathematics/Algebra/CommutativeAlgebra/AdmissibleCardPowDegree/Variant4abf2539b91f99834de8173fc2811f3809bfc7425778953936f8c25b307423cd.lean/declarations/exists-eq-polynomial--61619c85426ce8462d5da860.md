## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9df0bdac-a2d5-ce55-d394-826c236aa005`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 32–57.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_eq_polynomial [Semiring Fq] {d : ℕ} {m : ℕ} (hm : Fintype.card Fq ^ d ≤ m)
    (b : Fq[X]) (hb : natDegree b ≤ d) (A : Fin m.succ → Fq[X])
    (hA : ∀ i, degree (A i) < degree b) : ∃ i₀ i₁, i₀ ≠ i₁ ∧ A i₁ = A i₀ := by
  -- Since there are > q^d elements of A, and only q^d choices for the highest `d` coefficients,
  -- there must be two elements of A with the same coefficients at
  -- `0`, ... `degree b - 1` ≤ `d - 1`.
  -- In other words, the following map is not injective:
  set f : Fin m.succ → Fin d → Fq := fun i j => (A i).coeff j
  have : Fintype.card (Fin d → Fq) < Fintype.card (Fin m.succ) := by
    simpa using lt_of_le_of_lt hm (Nat.lt_succ_self m)
  -- Therefore, the differences have all coefficients higher than `deg b - d` equal.
  obtain ⟨i₀, i₁, i_ne, i_eq⟩ := Fintype.exists_ne_map_eq_of_card_lt f this
  use i₀, i₁, i_ne
  ext j
  -- The coefficients higher than `deg b` are the same because they are equal to 0.
  by_cases hbj : degree b ≤ j
  · rw [coeff_eq_zero_of_degree_lt (lt_of_lt_of_le (hA _) hbj),
      coeff_eq_zero_of_degree_lt (lt_of_lt_of_le (hA _) hbj)]
  -- So we only need to look for the coefficients between `0` and `deg b`.
  rw [not_le] at hbj
  apply congr_fun i_eq.symm ⟨j, _⟩
  exact lt_of_lt_of_le (coe_lt_degree.mp hbj) hb

/-- If `A` is a family of enough low-degree polynomials over a finite ring,
there is a pair of elements in `A` (with different indices but not necessarily
distinct), such that their difference has small degree. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/AdmissibleCardPowDegree/Variant4abf2539b91f99834de8173fc2811f3809bfc7425778953936f8c25b307423cd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/AdmissibleCardPowDegree/Variant4abf2539b91f99834de8173fc2811f3809bfc7425778953936f8c25b307423cd.lean#L32).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4425896951531ac05803c1cea702ad9f29a24aa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
