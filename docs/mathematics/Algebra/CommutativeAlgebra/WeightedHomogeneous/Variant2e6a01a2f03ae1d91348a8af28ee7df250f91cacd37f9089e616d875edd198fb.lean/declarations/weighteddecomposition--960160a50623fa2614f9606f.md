## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:63c527da82cd4e57178f6ebd73f363ac6dcb8e43271ee260787dc21412e68414`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 677–701.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def weightedDecomposition [DecidableEq M] :
    DirectSum.Decomposition (weightedHomogeneousSubmodule R w) where
  decompose' := decompose' R w
  left_inv φ := by
    classical
    conv_rhs => rw [← sum_weightedHomogeneousComponent w φ]
    rw [← DirectSum.sum_support_of (decompose' R w φ)]
    simp only [DirectSum.coeAddMonoidHom_of, map_sum,
      finsum_eq_sum _ (weightedHomogeneousComponent_finsupp φ)]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/WeightedHomogeneous/Variant2e6a01a2f03ae1d91348a8af28ee7df250f91cacd37f9089e616d875edd198fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/WeightedHomogeneous/Variant2e6a01a2f03ae1d91348a8af28ee7df250f91cacd37f9089e616d875edd198fb.lean#L677).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `37c4fb410c8eefe73cdfb95ff517de8036ea4277` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
