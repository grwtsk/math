## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:caa97977-5bc9-c6cf-8bdb-3397e363a6b3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 683–688.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem totalDegree_mul (a b : MvPolynomial σ R) :
    (a * b).totalDegree ≤ a.totalDegree + b.totalDegree :=
  AddMonoidAlgebra.sup_support_mul_le
    (by exact (Finsupp.sum_add_index' (fun _ => rfl) (fun _ _ _ => rfl)).le) _ _
#align mv_polynomial.total_degree_mul MvPolynomial.totalDegree_mul

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Variables/Variant60e9557b018d1f4e7642e640d6fec870333a911b1d42bfcb3e88283af8df28e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Variables/Variant60e9557b018d1f4e7642e640d6fec870333a911b1d42bfcb3e88283af8df28e7.lean#L683).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c26cfa37c4e1d1880409f69f24595fd6610ae06` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
