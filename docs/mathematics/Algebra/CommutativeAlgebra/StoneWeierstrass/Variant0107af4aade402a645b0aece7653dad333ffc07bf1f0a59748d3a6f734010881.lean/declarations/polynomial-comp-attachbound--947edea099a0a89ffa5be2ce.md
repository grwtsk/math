## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:12bfd941-c9cb-b890-b845-63ae31b3813d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 66–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem polynomial_comp_attachBound (A : Subalgebra ℝ C(X, ℝ)) (f : A) (g : ℝ[X]) :
    (g.toContinuousMapOn (Set.Icc (-‖f‖) ‖f‖)).comp (f : C(X, ℝ)).attachBound =
      Polynomial.aeval f g := by
  ext
  simp only [ContinuousMap.coe_comp, Function.comp_apply, ContinuousMap.attachBound_apply_coe,
    Polynomial.toContinuousMapOn_apply, Polynomial.aeval_subalgebra_coe,
    Polynomial.aeval_continuousMap_apply, Polynomial.toContinuousMap_apply]
#align continuous_map.polynomial_comp_attach_bound ContinuousMap.polynomial_comp_attachBound

/-- Given a continuous function `f` in a subalgebra of `C(X, ℝ)`, postcomposing by a polynomial
gives another function in `A`.

This lemma proves something slightly more subtle than this:
we take `f`, and think of it as a function into the restricted target `Set.Icc (-‖f‖) ‖f‖)`,
and then postcompose with a polynomial function on that interval.
This is in fact the same situation as above, and so also gives a function in `A`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/StoneWeierstrass/Variant0107af4aade402a645b0aece7653dad333ffc07bf1f0a59748d3a6f734010881.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/StoneWeierstrass/Variant0107af4aade402a645b0aece7653dad333ffc07bf1f0a59748d3a6f734010881.lean#L66).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `814bb20ff7e9737c105a088ed3b95aa65208022c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
