## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2e93ecd429e30da1723e8e70bc621b2b9056fd7825aae8636e3c1018628020f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 83–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure IsAdjoinRoot {R : Type u} (S : Type v) [CommSemiring R] [Semiring S] [Algebra R S]
    (f : R[X]) : Type max u v where
  map : R[X] →+* S
  map_surjective : Function.Surjective map
  ker_map : RingHom.ker map = Ideal.span {f}
  algebraMap_eq : algebraMap R S = map.comp Polynomial.C

-- This class doesn't really make sense on a predicate
/-- `IsAdjoinRootMonic S f` states that the ring `S` can be constructed by adjoining a specified
root of the monic polynomial `f : R[X]` to `R`.

As long as `f` is monic, there is a well-defined representation of elements of `S` as polynomials
in `R[X]` of degree lower than `deg f` (see `modByMonicHom` and `coeff`). In particular,
we have `IsAdjoinRootMonic.powerBasis`.

Bundling `Monic` into this structure is very useful when working with explicit `f`s such as
`X^2 - C a * X - C b` since it saves you carrying around the proofs of monicity.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/IsAdjoinRoot/Variantffff81c719ab7977403afcd8b65fcb2e8aff30862683b0fc95563189ac058cb7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/IsAdjoinRoot/Variantffff81c719ab7977403afcd8b65fcb2e8aff30862683b0fc95563189ac058cb7.lean#L83).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7a317046e79ece819b1b4c062642ba7dbb5cf52d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
