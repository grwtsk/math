## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:59b027f5-3b01-fab9-d472-f39baa727c2a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 256–265.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_iterateFrobenius_expand (f : MvPowerSeries σ R) (n : ℕ) :
    map (iterateFrobenius R p n) (expand (p ^ n) (pow_ne_zero n hp) f) = f ^ p ^ n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => simp [map_id]
  | succ k n_ih =>
    symm
    conv_lhs => rw [pow_succ, pow_mul, ← n_ih]
    simp_rw [← map_frobenius_expand p hp, pow_succ', add_comm k, iterateFrobenius_add,
      ← map_map, ← map_expand, ← expand_mul, iterateFrobenius_one]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Expand/Variant618c110cca03bebd6642066fe64de26f80721129085f27e886a17d906a90b978.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Expand/Variant618c110cca03bebd6642066fe64de26f80721129085f27e886a17d906a90b978.lean#L256).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3dfc06750b931be6ff53a9377c26ec353d22c334` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
