## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:82840837-c1ac-756b-6913-e12e6b81dcb7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 234–252.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem expand_contract [NoZeroDivisors R] {f : R[X]} (hf : Polynomial.derivative f = 0)
    (hp : p ≠ 0) : expand R p (contract p f) = f := by
  ext n
  rw [coeff_expand hp.bot_lt, coeff_contract hp]
  split_ifs with h
  · rw [Nat.div_mul_cancel h]
  · cases' n with n
    · exact absurd (dvd_zero p) h
    have := coeff_derivative f n
    rw [hf, coeff_zero, zero_eq_mul] at this
    cases' this with h'
    · rw [h']
    rename_i _ _ _ _ h'
    rw [← Nat.cast_succ, CharP.cast_eq_zero_iff R p] at h'
    exact absurd h' h
#align polynomial.expand_contract Polynomial.expand_contract

variable [hp : Fact p.Prime]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Expand/Varianta9115c7acea5e9c71fdf6c0fa2a4fb9b4ac642e2525bc488eed59c5862b7eed0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Expand/Varianta9115c7acea5e9c71fdf6c0fa2a4fb9b4ac642e2525bc488eed59c5862b7eed0.lean#L234).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `83498553c083f8aa864c2da0b1b887485be1386e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
