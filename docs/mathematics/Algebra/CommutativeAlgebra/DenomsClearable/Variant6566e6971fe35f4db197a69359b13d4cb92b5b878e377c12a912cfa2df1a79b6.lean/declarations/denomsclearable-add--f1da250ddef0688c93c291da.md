## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:21ba0c77-12a0-67e5-2867-55abe2d1aa9e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 65–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem DenomsClearable.add {N : ℕ} {f g : R[X]} :
    DenomsClearable a b N f i → DenomsClearable a b N g i → DenomsClearable a b N (f + g) i :=
  fun ⟨Df, bf, bfu, Hf⟩ ⟨Dg, bg, bgu, Hg⟩ =>
  ⟨Df + Dg, bf, bfu, by
    rw [map_add, Polynomial.map_add, eval_add, mul_add, Hf, Hg]
    congr

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/DenomsClearable/Variant6566e6971fe35f4db197a69359b13d4cb92b5b878e377c12a912cfa2df1a79b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/DenomsClearable/Variant6566e6971fe35f4db197a69359b13d4cb92b5b878e377c12a912cfa2df1a79b6.lean#L65).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c2885a6843a7897f4e8f7612cd97e1c74b678a46` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
