## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0ded6bf1-62cd-f94e-37d4-bea415cceda4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 210–221.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem coeff_trunc_order_mem (i : ℕ) :
    (g.trunc (g.map (Ideal.Quotient.mk I)).order.toNat).coeff i ∈ I := by
  rw [coeff_trunc]
  split_ifs with h
  · simpa [← RingHom.mem_ker] using coeff_of_lt_order_toNat _ h
  · exact zero_mem _

namespace IsWeierstrassDivisorAt

variable {g I} (H : g.IsWeierstrassDivisorAt I)
include H

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/WeierstrassPreparation/Variant1be80b2cbe43fc42a8cb36b555f0ed5ca0e231ddc410d479edfec4d108b9b160.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/WeierstrassPreparation/Variant1be80b2cbe43fc42a8cb36b555f0ed5ca0e231ddc410d479edfec4d108b9b160.lean#L210).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
