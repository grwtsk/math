## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ef2cbc37-01ba-87a4-ddc4-de5e82e1e5ae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 399–405.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mod_add [IsAdicComplete I A] : H.mod (f + f') = H.mod f + H.mod f' := by
  have H1 := (H.isWeierstrassDivisionAt_div_mod f).add (H.isWeierstrassDivisionAt_div_mod f')
  have H2 := H.isWeierstrassDivisionAt_div_mod (f + f')
  exact (H.eq_of_mul_add_eq_mul_add H2.degree_lt H1.degree_lt
    (H2.eq_mul_add.symm.trans H1.eq_mul_add)).2

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/WeierstrassPreparation/Variant1be80b2cbe43fc42a8cb36b555f0ed5ca0e231ddc410d479edfec4d108b9b160.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/WeierstrassPreparation/Variant1be80b2cbe43fc42a8cb36b555f0ed5ca0e231ddc410d479edfec4d108b9b160.lean#L399).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `59c43bbb59ec74834ac61a9c2be0611ce79a0489` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
