## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1b046cbf-b162-c8ee-0f01-67ead9fe63d9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 68–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    0 ≤ boundPolyAbs p domain c := by

/-! ### Bernstein Polynomial Bounds

Bernstein polynomials provide tighter bounds than naive interval arithmetic.
For a polynomial P(x) on [a,b], the range is contained in [min bⱼ, max bⱼ]
where bⱼ are the Bernstein coefficients.

This avoids the "dependency problem" where naive interval arithmetic
gives P(x) = x - x² on [0,1] → [-1, 1] instead of the true [0, 0.25].

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Core/Variantf7ccba4a2452268e4196188451b2ba840d13e8ac7bb4701acc0562d450391ca8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Core/Variantf7ccba4a2452268e4196188451b2ba840d13e8ac7bb4701acc0562d450391ca8.lean#L68).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6a776bf727e8916d67b87be3734405fd02bcef17` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
