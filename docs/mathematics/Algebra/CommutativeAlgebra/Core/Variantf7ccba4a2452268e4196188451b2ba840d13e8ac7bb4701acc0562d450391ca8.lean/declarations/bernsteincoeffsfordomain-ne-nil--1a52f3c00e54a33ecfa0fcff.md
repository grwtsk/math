## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0dc5bc46-0e3e-7acb-27a4-0411de03f9cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 716–730.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem bernsteinCoeffsForDomain_ne_nil (p : Polynomial ℚ) (lo hi c : ℚ) :
    bernsteinCoeffsForDomain p lo hi c ≠ [] := by
  simp only [bernsteinCoeffsForDomain]
  have htlen : (transformPolyCoeffs p (lo - c) (hi - c)).length = p.natDegree + 1 :=
    transformPolyCoeffs_length p (lo - c) (hi - c)
  have hpos : 0 < (transformPolyCoeffs p (lo - c) (hi - c)).length := by omega
  have hlen : (monomialToBernstein (transformPolyCoeffs p (lo - c) (hi - c))).length =
    (transformPolyCoeffs p (lo - c) (hi - c)).length :=
    monomialToBernstein_length _ hpos
  intro h
  rw [h] at hlen
  simp at hlen

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Core/Variantf7ccba4a2452268e4196188451b2ba840d13e8ac7bb4701acc0562d450391ca8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Core/Variantf7ccba4a2452268e4196188451b2ba840d13e8ac7bb4701acc0562d450391ca8.lean#L716).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6a776bf727e8916d67b87be3734405fd02bcef17` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
