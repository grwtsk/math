## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:271d621d-64e8-2fec-5ae4-03e7721cc7cf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 114–122.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem polynomialVector_mem_coordinateDomain (p : ℝ[X]) {t : ℝ} (ht : 0 ≤ t) :
    polynomialVector t ht p ∈ coordinateDomain (momentMeasure t) := by
  rw [mem_coordinateDomain]
  apply (polynomial_memLp (Polynomial.X * p) ht).ae_eq
  filter_upwards [polynomialVector_ae p ht] with x hx
  rw [hx]
  simp

/-- The polynomial vector equipped with its proved exact domain membership. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ThetaMultiplicationAdapter/Variant8c97ccb37dfee41897e5f5eb7f83b36f33f8c150aab6265d7b1ba0e33258a7a4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/ThetaMultiplicationAdapter/Variant8c97ccb37dfee41897e5f5eb7f83b36f33f8c150aab6265d7b1ba0e33258a7a4.lean#L114).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d5b2ab194340891c25e40f22439715ce9865fe2d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
