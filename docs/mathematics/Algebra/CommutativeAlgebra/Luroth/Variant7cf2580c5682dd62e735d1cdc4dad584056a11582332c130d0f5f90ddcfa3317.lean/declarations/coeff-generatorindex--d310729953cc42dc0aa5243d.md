## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:18931aa0-e0c4-f0d1-ef12-00d9a12ba1b3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 216–224.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Φ_coeff_generatorIndex (h : E ≠ ⊥) :
    algebraMap K[X] K⟮X⟯ ((Φ E).coeff (generatorIndex h)) =
    algebraMap K[X] K⟮X⟯ (c E).num * generator E := by
  have := congr($(C_c_mul_φ h).coeff (generatorIndex h))
  rw [coeff_map, coeff_C_mul, coeff_map, IntermediateField.algebraMap_apply,
    ← num_div_denom (c E), c_denom h, map_one, div_one] at this
  rw [generator_eq_coeff h]
  exact this.symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Luroth/Variant7cf2580c5682dd62e735d1cdc4dad584056a11582332c130d0f5f90ddcfa3317.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Luroth/Variant7cf2580c5682dd62e735d1cdc4dad584056a11582332c130d0f5f90ddcfa3317.lean#L216).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4567a817b4413394977204cac0a659ea01a08673` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
