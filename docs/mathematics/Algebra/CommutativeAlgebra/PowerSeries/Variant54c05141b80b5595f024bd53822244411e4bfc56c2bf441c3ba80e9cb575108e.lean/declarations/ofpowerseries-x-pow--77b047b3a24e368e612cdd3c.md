## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2c825825-bc84-acfb-ff95-7569873c81c0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–155.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ofPowerSeries_X_pow {R} [Semiring R] (n : ℕ) :
    ofPowerSeries Γ R (PowerSeries.X ^ n) = single (n : Γ) 1 := by
  simp

-- Lemmas about converting hahn_series over fintype to and from mv_power_series
/-- The ring `HahnSeries (σ →₀ ℕ) R` is isomorphic to `MvPowerSeries σ R` for a `Finite` `σ`.
We take the index set of the hahn series to be `Finsupp` rather than `pi`,
even though we assume `Finite σ` as this is more natural for alignment with `MvPowerSeries`.
After importing `Mathlib/Algebra/Order/Pi.lean` the ring `HahnSeries (σ → ℕ) R` could be constructed
instead.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/PowerSeries/Variant54c05141b80b5595f024bd53822244411e4bfc56c2bf441c3ba80e9cb575108e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/PowerSeries/Variant54c05141b80b5595f024bd53822244411e4bfc56c2bf441c3ba80e9cb575108e.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e13cc2ad00678c03bcf37147c17ff0a4599643cd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
