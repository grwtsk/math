## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f78585f67b2e9144cff7cf44777137feae9e1afb5a7f1bc9ab9307a0a5dc299d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 202–211.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toPowerSeriesAlg : A⟦ℕ⟧ ≃ₐ[R] PowerSeries A :=
  { toPowerSeries with
    commutes' := fun r => by
      ext n
      cases n <;> simp [algebraMap_apply, PowerSeries.algebraMap_apply] }

variable (Γ) [Semiring Γ] [PartialOrder Γ] [IsStrictOrderedRing Γ]

/-- Casting a power series as a Hahn series with coefficients from a strictly ordered semiring. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/PowerSeries/Variantf77519d05eacfb30e6696adc43ce65f4348269ae62ccc1bcdad1c093a6dfd4a0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/PowerSeries/Variantf77519d05eacfb30e6696adc43ce65f4348269ae62ccc1bcdad1c093a6dfd4a0.lean#L202).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `791b8c529534024ad46d06248621083886e908e3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
