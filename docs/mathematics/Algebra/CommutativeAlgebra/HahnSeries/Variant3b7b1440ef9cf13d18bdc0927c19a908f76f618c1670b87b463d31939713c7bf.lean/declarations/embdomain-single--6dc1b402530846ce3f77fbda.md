## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:65ffc1ce-178b-f2d3-7a27-d9ffdf9c66c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 327–337.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem embDomain_single {f : Γ ↪o Γ'} {g : Γ} {r : R} :
    embDomain f (single g r) = single (f g) r := by
  ext g'
  by_cases h : g' = f g
  · simp [h]
  rw [embDomain_notin_image_support, single_coeff_of_ne h]
  by_cases hr : r = 0
  · simp [hr]
  rwa [support_single_of_ne hr, Set.image_singleton, Set.mem_singleton_iff]
#align hahn_series.emb_domain_single HahnSeries.embDomain_single

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/HahnSeries/Variant3b7b1440ef9cf13d18bdc0927c19a908f76f618c1670b87b463d31939713c7bf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/HahnSeries/Variant3b7b1440ef9cf13d18bdc0927c19a908f76f618c1670b87b463d31939713c7bf.lean#L327).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `850ccd987861169c5918b42f459bb318355f8f58` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
