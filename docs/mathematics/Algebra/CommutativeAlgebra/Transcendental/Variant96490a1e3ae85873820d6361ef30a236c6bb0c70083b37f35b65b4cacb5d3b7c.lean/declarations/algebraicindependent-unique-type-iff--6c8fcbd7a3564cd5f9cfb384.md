## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:65fb5eb2-b5f1-5b4c-ba4f-ac891bbe233f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–57.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem algebraicIndependent_unique_type_iff [Unique ι] :
    AlgebraicIndependent R x ↔ Transcendental R (x default) := by
  rw [transcendental_iff_injective, algebraicIndependent_iff_injective_aeval]
  let i := uniqueAlgEquiv R ι
  have key : aeval (R := R) x = (Polynomial.aeval (R := R) (x default)).comp i := by
    ext y
    simp [i, Subsingleton.elim y default]
  simp [key]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Transcendental/Variant96490a1e3ae85873820d6361ef30a236c6bb0c70083b37f35b65b4cacb5d3b7c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Transcendental/Variant96490a1e3ae85873820d6361ef30a236c6bb0c70083b37f35b65b4cacb5d3b7c.lean#L49).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
