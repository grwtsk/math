## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:edae2524-b1dc-8d55-6ae8-def31820f169`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 214–224.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sumElim_of_tower {ι'} {y : ι' → A} (hxS : range x ⊆ range (algebraMap S A))
    (hy : AlgebraicIndependent S y) : AlgebraicIndependent R (Sum.elim y x) := by
  let e := AlgEquiv.ofInjective (IsScalarTower.toAlgHom R S A) hy.algebraMap_injective
  set Rx := adjoin R (range x)
  let _ : Algebra Rx S :=
    (e.symm.toAlgHom.comp <| Subalgebra.inclusion <| adjoin_le hxS).toAlgebra
  have : IsScalarTower Rx S A := .of_algebraMap_eq fun x ↦ show _ = (e (e.symm _)).1 by simp
  refine hx.sumElim (hy.restrictScalars (e.symm.injective.comp ?_))
  simpa only [AlgHom.coe_toRingHom] using Subalgebra.inclusion_injective _

omit hx in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Transcendental/Variant96490a1e3ae85873820d6361ef30a236c6bb0c70083b37f35b65b4cacb5d3b7c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Transcendental/Variant96490a1e3ae85873820d6361ef30a236c6bb0c70083b37f35b65b4cacb5d3b7c.lean#L214).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ef261d6016db892c215a10a908b6a78b1d07f431` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
