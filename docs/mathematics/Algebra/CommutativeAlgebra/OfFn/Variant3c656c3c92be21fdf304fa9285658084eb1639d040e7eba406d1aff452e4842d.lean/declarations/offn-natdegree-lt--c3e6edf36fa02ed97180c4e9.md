## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f1b1438b-3242-6694-3f97-a264aa431b12`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–92.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ofFn_natDegree_lt {n : ℕ} (h : 1 ≤ n) (v : Fin n → R) : (ofFn n v).natDegree < n := by
  rw [Nat.lt_iff_le_pred h, natDegree_le_iff_coeff_eq_zero]
  exact fun _ h ↦ ofFn_coeff_eq_zero_of_ge _ <| Nat.le_of_pred_lt h

/-- `ofFn n v` has `degree` smaller than `n`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/OfFn/Variant3c656c3c92be21fdf304fa9285658084eb1639d040e7eba406d1aff452e4842d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/OfFn/Variant3c656c3c92be21fdf304fa9285658084eb1639d040e7eba406d1aff452e4842d.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b0ccd43c2c7413b283d5004bc5f09211749102a5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
