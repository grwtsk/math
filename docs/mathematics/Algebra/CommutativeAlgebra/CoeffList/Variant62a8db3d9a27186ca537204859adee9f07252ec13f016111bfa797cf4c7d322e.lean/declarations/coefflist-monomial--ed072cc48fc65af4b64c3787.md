## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:86c8b4b4-bf13-a75c-87d4-fab004403d06`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 104–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coeffList_monomial {x : R} (hx : x ≠ 0) (n : ℕ) :
    (monomial n x).coeffList = x :: List.replicate n 0 := by
  have h := mt (Polynomial.monomial_eq_zero_iff x n).mp hx
  apply List.ext_get (by classical simp [hx])
  rintro (_|k) _ h₁
  · exact (coeffList_eq_cons_leadingCoeff h).rec (by simp_all)
  · rw [List.length_cons, List.length_replicate] at h₁
    have : ((monomial n) x).natDegree.succ = n + 1 := by
      simp [Polynomial.natDegree_monomial_eq n hx]
    simpa [coeffList, withBotSucc_degree_eq_natDegree_add_one h]
      using Polynomial.coeff_monomial_of_ne _ (by omega)

/- Coefficients of a polynomial `P` are always the leading coefficient, some number of zeros, and
then `coeffList P.eraseLead`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/CoeffList/Variant62a8db3d9a27186ca537204859adee9f07252ec13f016111bfa797cf4c7d322e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/CoeffList/Variant62a8db3d9a27186ca537204859adee9f07252ec13f016111bfa797cf4c7d322e.lean#L104).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `42ec7e46c1f58c128f41ff8ba3cca3df5bd170f9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
