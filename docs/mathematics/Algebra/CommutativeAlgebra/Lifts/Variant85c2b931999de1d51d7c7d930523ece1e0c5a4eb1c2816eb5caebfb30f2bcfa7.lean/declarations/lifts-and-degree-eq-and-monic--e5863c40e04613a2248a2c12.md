## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:756e5370-b0a3-b32a-e4ba-3566c411a5ae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 173–184.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lifts_and_degree_eq_and_monic [Nontrivial S] {p : S[X]} (hlifts : p ∈ lifts f)
    (hp : p.Monic) : ∃ q : R[X], map f q = p ∧ q.degree = p.degree ∧ q.Monic := by
  rw [lifts_iff_coeff_lifts] at hlifts
  let g : ℕ → R := fun k ↦ (hlifts k).choose
  have hg k : f (g k) = p.coeff k := (hlifts k).choose_spec
  let q : R[X] := X ^ p.natDegree + ∑ k ∈ Finset.range p.natDegree, C (g k) * X ^ k
  have hq : map f q = p := by
    simp_rw [q, Polynomial.map_add, Polynomial.map_sum, Polynomial.map_mul, Polynomial.map_pow,
      map_X, map_C, hg, ← hp.as_sum]
  have h : q.Monic := monic_X_pow_add (by simp_rw [← Fin.sum_univ_eq_sum_range, degree_sum_fin_lt])
  exact ⟨q, hq, hq ▸ (h.degree_map f).symm, h⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Lifts/Variant85c2b931999de1d51d7c7d930523ece1e0c5a4eb1c2816eb5caebfb30f2bcfa7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Lifts/Variant85c2b931999de1d51d7c7d930523ece1e0c5a4eb1c2816eb5caebfb30f2bcfa7.lean#L173).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `71765229b366e2223ccd92dae74ba9a649c72f05` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
