## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a486b4bd-5443-f2b8-24de-6e3ca7aa9e68`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 138–147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem monomial_mem_lifts_and_degree_eq {s : S} {n : ℕ} (hl : monomial n s ∈ lifts f) :
    ∃ q : R[X], map f q = monomial n s ∧ q.degree = (monomial n s).degree := by
  rcases eq_or_ne s 0 with rfl | h
  · exact ⟨0, by simp⟩
  obtain ⟨a, rfl⟩ := coeff_monomial_same n s ▸ (monomial n s).lifts_iff_coeff_lifts.mp hl n
  refine ⟨monomial n a, map_monomial f, ?_⟩
  rw [degree_monomial, degree_monomial n h]
  exact mt (fun ha ↦ ha ▸ map_zero f) h

/-- A polynomial that lifts can be lifted to a polynomial of the same support. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Lifts/Variant8c1bf1cbf370a96151f5cd87aa0a19c3d5cbaaacb574310da7e83a17202ebad4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Lifts/Variant8c1bf1cbf370a96151f5cd87aa0a19c3d5cbaaacb574310da7e83a17202ebad4.lean#L138).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cf721a2af4f72be3b0bf678a570b780bae31874e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
