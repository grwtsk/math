## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:40b814ec-c7bb-58a7-c231-4afb3a9eb768`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 165–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isDomain_map_C_quotient {P : Ideal R} (_ : IsPrime P) :
    IsDomain (R[X] ⧸ (map (C : R →+* R[X]) P : Ideal R[X])) :=
  MulEquiv.isDomain (Polynomial (R ⧸ P)) (polynomialQuotientEquivQuotientPolynomial P).symm

/-- Given any ring `R` and an ideal `I` of `R[X]`, we get a map `R → R[x] → R[x]/I`.
  If we let `R` be the image of `R` in `R[x]/I` then we also have a map `R[x] → R'[x]`.
  In particular we can map `I` across this map, to get `I'` and a new map `R' → R'[x] → R'[x]/I`.
  This theorem shows `I'` will not contain any non-zero constant polynomials. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Quotient/Variantb6490a166b359574c093a8885105d34d713e74d2afa8607ff760fc1a7ebc1cff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Quotient/Variantb6490a166b359574c093a8885105d34d713e74d2afa8607ff760fc1a7ebc1cff.lean#L165).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9708074220c3d12f6598f7e6b126fc3d7f2f4d55` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
