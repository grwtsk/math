## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7c575384-486e-a919-4086-0d8b947d7ff9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 61–67.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integralNormalization_coeff {i : ℕ} :
    (integralNormalization p).coeff i =
      if p.degree = i then 1 else coeff p i * p.leadingCoeff ^ (p.natDegree - 1 - i) := by
  have : p.coeff i = 0 → p.degree ≠ i := fun hc hd => coeff_ne_zero_of_eq_degree hd hc
  simp +contextual [sum_def, integralNormalization, coeff_monomial, this,
    mem_support_iff]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/IntegralNormalization/Variantfc17efa0e5f0d5555b7aa76e83d6710dda111c937356a5c2515c7a1824e4f0af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/IntegralNormalization/Variantfc17efa0e5f0d5555b7aa76e83d6710dda111c937356a5c2515c7a1824e4f0af.lean#L61).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
