## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f9f64ab4-d490-1724-b3a3-5d89f020d6c0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 201–216.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem support_integralNormalization {f : R[X]} :
    (integralNormalization f).support = f.support := by
  nontriviality R using Subsingleton.eq_zero (α := R[X])
  have : IsDomain R := {}
  by_cases hf : f = 0; · simp [hf]
  ext i
  refine ⟨fun h => support_integralNormalization_subset h, ?_⟩
  simp only [integralNormalization_coeff, mem_support_iff]
  intro hfi
  split_ifs with hi <;> simp [hf, hfi]

end IsCancelMulZero

end IntegralNormalization

end Polynomial
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/IntegralNormalization/Variantfc17efa0e5f0d5555b7aa76e83d6710dda111c937356a5c2515c7a1824e4f0af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/IntegralNormalization/Variantfc17efa0e5f0d5555b7aa76e83d6710dda111c937356a5c2515c7a1824e4f0af.lean#L201).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a925e5e159acb43ee2da9ca8b57482ec40d3ddb8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
