## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2c30f551-07e3-601e-9a35-e1163b2c8104`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 132–143.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem signVariations_C_mul (P : Polynomial R) (hx : η ≠ 0) :
    signVariations (C η * P) = signVariations P := by
  wlog! hx2 : 0 < η
  · simpa [lt_of_le_of_ne hx2, hx] using this (η := -η) (P := -P)
  rw [signVariations, signVariations, coeffList_C_mul _ hx, List.signVariations_map]
  intro x
  rw [sign_mul, sign_pos hx2, one_mul]

/-- If P's coefficients start with signs `[+, -, ...]`, then multiplying by a binomial `X - η`
  commutes with `eraseLead` in the number of sign changes. This is because the product of
  `P` and `X - η` has the pattern `[+, -, ...]` as well, so then `P.eraseLead` starts with
  `[-,...]`, and multiplying by `X - η` gives `[-, ...]` too. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/RuleOfSigns/Variant613d91fbb7d955370b935ecf2fa8660fb3c3f0817102222b22319e397f62fca0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/RuleOfSigns/Variant613d91fbb7d955370b935ecf2fa8660fb3c3f0817102222b22319e397f62fca0.lean#L132).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fd5eb56e5b08d69344886f293b8780cd7182fcc9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
