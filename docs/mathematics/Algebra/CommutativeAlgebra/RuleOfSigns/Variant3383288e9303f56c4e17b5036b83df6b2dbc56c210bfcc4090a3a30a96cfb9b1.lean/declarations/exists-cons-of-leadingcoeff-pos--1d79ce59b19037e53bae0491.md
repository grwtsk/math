## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:23b41bee-8c5a-4acb-7a89-27a323f18526`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 193–245.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- If a polynomial starts with two positive coefficients, then the sign changes in the product
`(X - η) * P` is at least the sign changes of `(X - η) * P.eraseLead`. This lemma lets us do
induction on the degree of P when P starts with matching coefficient signs. Of course this is
also true when the first two coefficients of P are *negative*, but we just prove the case where
they're positive since it's cleaner and sufficient for the later use. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/RuleOfSigns/Variant3383288e9303f56c4e17b5036b83df6b2dbc56c210bfcc4090a3a30a96cfb9b1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/RuleOfSigns/Variant3383288e9303f56c4e17b5036b83df6b2dbc56c210bfcc4090a3a30a96cfb9b1.lean#L193).
