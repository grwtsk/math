## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e3e6e060-c4d3-5c05-ccd8-78440b106140`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–201.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem wittPolynomial_vars_subset (n : ℕ) : (wittPolynomial p R n).vars ⊆ range (n + 1) := by
  rw [← map_wittPolynomial p (Int.castRingHom R), ← wittPolynomial_vars p ℤ]
  apply vars_map

end PPrime

## Witt polynomials as a basis of the polynomial algebra

If `p` is invertible in `R`, then the Witt polynomials form a basis
of the polynomial algebra `MvPolynomial ℕ R`.
The polynomials `xInTermsOfW` give the coordinate transformation in the backwards direction.
-/


/-- The `xInTermsOfW p R n` is the polynomial on the basis of Witt polynomials
that corresponds to the ordinary `X n`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/WittPolynomial/Variantfb7ec18606fd2191ff60d04464b2e8e3b33e86270e588ea96e06b185bfb710ff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/WittPolynomial/Variantfb7ec18606fd2191ff60d04464b2e8e3b33e86270e588ea96e06b185bfb710ff.lean#L182).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `85fe636349227feac6e11bc4df6fbd29183d92c8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
