## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:191dff6e-56f4-fb0a-c51b-821529ad8faf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cyclotomic_injective [CharZero R] : Function.Injective fun n => cyclotomic n R := by
  intro n m hnm
  simp only at hnm
  rcases eq_or_ne n 0 with (rfl | hzero)
  · rw [cyclotomic_zero] at hnm
    replace hnm := congr_arg natDegree hnm
    rwa [natDegree_one, natDegree_cyclotomic, eq_comm, Nat.totient_eq_zero, eq_comm] at hnm
  · haveI := NeZero.mk hzero
    rw [← map_cyclotomic_int _ R, ← map_cyclotomic_int _ R] at hnm
    replace hnm := map_injective (Int.castRingHom R) Int.cast_injective hnm
    replace hnm := congr_arg (map (Int.castRingHom ℂ)) hnm
    rw [map_cyclotomic_int, map_cyclotomic_int] at hnm
    have hprim := Complex.isPrimitiveRoot_exp _ hzero
    have hroot := isRoot_cyclotomic_iff (R := ℂ).2 hprim
    rw [hnm] at hroot
    haveI hmzero : NeZero m := ⟨fun h => by simp [h] at hroot⟩
    rw [isRoot_cyclotomic_iff (R := ℂ)] at hroot
    replace hprim := hprim.eq_orderOf
    rwa [← IsPrimitiveRoot.eq_orderOf hroot] at hprim

/-- The minimal polynomial of a primitive `n`-th root of unity `μ` divides `cyclotomic n ℤ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Roots/Variant6b541f20ce5eb92e09543b2cbb19bf03a4a5b0d6ea9dc96816d4daaef49ac244.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Roots/Variant6b541f20ce5eb92e09543b2cbb19bf03a4a5b0d6ea9dc96816d4daaef49ac244.lean#L141).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e20d98d25f1186ae46ebae54afaf6b28d2fa1680` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
