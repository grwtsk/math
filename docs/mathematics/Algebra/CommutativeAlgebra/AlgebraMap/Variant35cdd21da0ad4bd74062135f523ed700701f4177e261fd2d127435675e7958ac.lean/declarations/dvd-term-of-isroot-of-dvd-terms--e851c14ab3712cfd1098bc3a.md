## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eb74f4ec-6114-4184-f953-0a45261168d1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 537–554.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dvd_term_of_isRoot_of_dvd_terms {r p : S} {f : S[X]} (i : ℕ) (hr : f.IsRoot r)
    (h : ∀ j ≠ i, p ∣ f.coeff j * r ^ j) : p ∣ f.coeff i * r ^ i :=
  dvd_term_of_dvd_eval_of_dvd_terms i (Eq.symm hr ▸ dvd_zero p) h

end CommRing

end aeval

section Ring

variable [Ring R]

/-- The evaluation map is not generally multiplicative when the coefficient ring is noncommutative,
but nevertheless any polynomial of the form `p * (X - monomial 0 r)` is sent to zero
when evaluated at `r`.

This is the key step in our proof of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/AlgebraMap/Variant35cdd21da0ad4bd74062135f523ed700701f4177e261fd2d127435675e7958ac.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/AlgebraMap/Variant35cdd21da0ad4bd74062135f523ed700701f4177e261fd2d127435675e7958ac.lean#L537).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `552dcb07156fc48c4d2b4fba51ee13c1cbe19e9f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
