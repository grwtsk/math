## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:11cf1a18-6ef0-1399-1c0a-0a578b312828`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–262.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isUnit_of_isUnit_leadingCoeff_of_isUnit_map (hf : IsUnit f.leadingCoeff)
    (H : IsUnit (map φ f)) : IsUnit f := by
  have dz := degree_eq_zero_of_isUnit H
  rw [degree_map_eq_of_leadingCoeff_ne_zero] at dz
  · rw [eq_C_of_degree_eq_zero dz]
    refine IsUnit.map C ?_
    convert! hf
    change coeff f 0 = coeff f (natDegree f)
    rw [(degree_eq_iff_natDegree_eq _).1 dz]
    · rfl
    rintro rfl
    simp at H
  · intro h
    have u : IsUnit (φ f.leadingCoeff) := IsUnit.map φ hf
    rw [h] at u
    simp at u

end

end Polynomial
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Degree/Variantc23f9bbb84ac5479d2aba4d22dd131283c497befa6a255d761b7824cf2979296.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Degree/Variantc23f9bbb84ac5479d2aba4d22dd131283c497befa6a255d761b7824cf2979296.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b356338574e9bb276346e930da64ce79b8ee23e2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
