## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:95b3bf75-b21f-3492-f3b3-be0baacc630a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 233–247.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_of_monic_of_associated (hp : p.Monic) (hq : q.Monic) (hpq : Associated p q) : p = q := by
  obtain ⟨u, rfl⟩ := hpq
  rw [(hp.of_mul_monic_left hq).eq_one_of_isUnit u.isUnit, mul_one]

section MonicDegreeEq

variable [Semiring S]

variable (R n) in
/--
The type of monic polynomials of degree `n`.

The implementation is slightly different because it is useful to still contain `X ^ n` when
`R` is trivial. See `MonicDegreeEq.mk` for the usual constructor.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Monic/Variant5ab834ed87e91fa62c1133b9cb0ac3ca57896962134e5efbbabb859a8c5a458a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Monic/Variant5ab834ed87e91fa62c1133b9cb0ac3ca57896962134e5efbbabb859a8c5a458a.lean#L233).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `36bbc4359f4cff6d176d78390ab5a92c4b5be3f7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
