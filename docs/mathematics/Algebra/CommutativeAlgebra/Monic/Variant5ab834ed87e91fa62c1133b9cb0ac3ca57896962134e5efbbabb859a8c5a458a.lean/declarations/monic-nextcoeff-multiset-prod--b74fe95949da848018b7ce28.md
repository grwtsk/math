## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:06bd8580-d1cc-cdbb-eac9-fc3cf513a9bf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 310–322.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Monic.nextCoeff_multiset_prod (t : Multiset ι) (f : ι → R[X]) (h : ∀ i ∈ t, Monic (f i)) :
    nextCoeff (t.map f).prod = (t.map fun i => nextCoeff (f i)).sum := by
  revert h
  refine Multiset.induction_on t ?_ fun a t ih ht => ?_
  · simp only [Multiset.notMem_zero, forall_prop_of_true, forall_prop_of_false, Multiset.map_zero,
      Multiset.prod_zero, Multiset.sum_zero, not_false_iff, forall_true_iff]
    rw [← C_1]
    rw [nextCoeff_C_eq_zero]
  · rw [Multiset.map_cons, Multiset.prod_cons, Multiset.map_cons, Multiset.sum_cons,
      Monic.nextCoeff_mul, ih]
    exacts [fun i hi => ht i (Multiset.mem_cons_of_mem hi), ht a (Multiset.mem_cons_self _ _),
      monic_multiset_prod_of_monic _ _ fun b bs => ht _ (Multiset.mem_cons_of_mem bs)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Monic/Variant5ab834ed87e91fa62c1133b9cb0ac3ca57896962134e5efbbabb859a8c5a458a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Monic/Variant5ab834ed87e91fa62c1133b9cb0ac3ca57896962134e5efbbabb859a8c5a458a.lean#L310).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `36bbc4359f4cff6d176d78390ab5a92c4b5be3f7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
