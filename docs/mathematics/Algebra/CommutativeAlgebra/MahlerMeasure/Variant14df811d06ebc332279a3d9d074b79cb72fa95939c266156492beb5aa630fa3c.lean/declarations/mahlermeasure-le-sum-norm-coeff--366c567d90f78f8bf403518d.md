## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b4478b2e-57c2-60f7-4efa-4a8f633da4bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 271–307.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- **Landau's inequality**: the Mahler measure of a polynomial is at most the ℓ² norm
of its coefficient vector, `√(∑ ‖coeff i‖²)`.

This is the classical inequality due to Landau (1905). Combined with the multiplicativity of the
Mahler measure (`mahlerMeasure_mul`), it gives the Mignotte bound on coefficients of polynomial
factors.

TODO: restate using a dedicated polynomial ℓ² norm once one is defined (see the TODO in
`Mathlib.Analysis.Polynomial.Norm`). -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/MahlerMeasure/Variant14df811d06ebc332279a3d9d074b79cb72fa95939c266156492beb5aa630fa3c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/MahlerMeasure/Variant14df811d06ebc332279a3d9d074b79cb72fa95939c266156492beb5aa630fa3c.lean#L271).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
