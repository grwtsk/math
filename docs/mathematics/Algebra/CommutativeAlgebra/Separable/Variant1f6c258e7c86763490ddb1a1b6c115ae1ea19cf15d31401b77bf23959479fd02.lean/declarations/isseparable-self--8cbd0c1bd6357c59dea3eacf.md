## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:017d1e5f6450dbf3fc5dbce1ff454c3575c4c08b55d0d4d54170eb0c4b65688d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 519–527.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isSeparable_self (F : Type*) [Field F] : IsSeparable F F :=
  ⟨fun x => isIntegral_algebraMap,
   fun x => by
    rw [minpoly.eq_X_sub_C']
    exact separable_X_sub_C⟩
#align is_separable_self isSeparable_self

-- See note [lower instance priority]
/-- A finite field extension in characteristic 0 is separable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Separable/Variant1f6c258e7c86763490ddb1a1b6c115ae1ea19cf15d31401b77bf23959479fd02.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Separable/Variant1f6c258e7c86763490ddb1a1b6c115ae1ea19cf15d31401b77bf23959479fd02.lean#L519).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `def5f1a76b00df7be7ed85a0524e0f291a2825d0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
