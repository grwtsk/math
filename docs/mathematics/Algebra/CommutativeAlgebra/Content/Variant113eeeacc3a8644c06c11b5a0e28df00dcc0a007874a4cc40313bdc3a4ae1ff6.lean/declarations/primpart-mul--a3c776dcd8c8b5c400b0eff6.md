## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0385cd72-d7d9-ff25-38d6-ca420570e10d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 397–406.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem primPart_mul {R} [CommRing R] [StrongNormalizedGCDMonoid R] {p q : R[X]} (h0 : p * q ≠ 0) :
    (p * q).primPart = p.primPart * q.primPart := by
  rw [Ne, ← content_eq_zero_iff, ← C_eq_zero] at h0
  apply mul_left_cancel₀ h0
  conv_lhs =>
    rw [← (p * q).eq_C_content_mul_primPart, p.eq_C_content_mul_primPart,
      q.eq_C_content_mul_primPart]
  rw [content_mul, map_mul]
  ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Content/Variant113eeeacc3a8644c06c11b5a0e28df00dcc0a007874a4cc40313bdc3a4ae1ff6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Content/Variant113eeeacc3a8644c06c11b5a0e28df00dcc0a007874a4cc40313bdc3a4ae1ff6.lean#L397).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8cb7485b26acfec79834e9ff258359d3eb1ab6e9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
