## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6ad322b8-cd43-eddd-370d-bf1e2bbb9ef3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 912–920.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem add_one_mul_T_eq_poly_in_U (n : ℤ) :
    ((n : R[X]) + 1) * T R (n + 1) = X * U R n - (1 - X ^ 2) * derivative (U R n) := by
  have h₁ := congr_arg derivative <| T_eq_X_mul_T_sub_pol_U R n
  simp only [derivative_sub, derivative_mul, derivative_X, derivative_one, derivative_X_pow,
    T_derivative_eq_U, C_eq_natCast] at h₁
  have h₂ := T_eq_U_sub_X_mul_U R (n + 1)
  linear_combination (norm := (push_cast; ring_nf))
    h₁ + (n + 2) * h₂

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Chebyshev/Variant357dec84249e33c94221f9bfc6cedd8744c6af542fa5522c5f8bf7612db847f1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Chebyshev/Variant357dec84249e33c94221f9bfc6cedd8744c6af542fa5522c5f8bf7612db847f1.lean#L912).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a0acd79b116bc87d4c406b179366b4c4413ac11` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
