## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0806d980-726d-938b-cdcc-f340b54aecdb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 409–417.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma comp_neg_X_leadingCoeff_eq [Ring R] (p : R[X]) :
    (p.comp (-X)).leadingCoeff = (-1) ^ p.natDegree * p.leadingCoeff := by
  nontriviality R
  by_cases h : p = 0
  · simp [h]
  rw [Polynomial.leadingCoeff, natDegree_comp_eq_of_mul_ne_zero, coeff_comp_degree_mul_degree] <;>
  simp [((Commute.neg_one_left _).pow_left _).eq, h]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Lemmas/Variant70e1ffe5c24fbf372293c2853dd3168169c023cf0d36e91402b5273f803181dc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CommutativeAlgebra/Lemmas/Variant70e1ffe5c24fbf372293c2853dd3168169c023cf0d36e91402b5273f803181dc.lean#L409).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `51465d8f5669bd9cd640bdcd9451489094075c78` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
