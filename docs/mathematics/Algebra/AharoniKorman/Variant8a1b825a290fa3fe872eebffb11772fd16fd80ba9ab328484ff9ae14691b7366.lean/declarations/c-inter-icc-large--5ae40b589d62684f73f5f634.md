## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:075206bf-5acf-7ddf-3675-03f59f5c2c2a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 624–648.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    xh + yh + 1 - (xl + yl) ≤ #{x ∈ (Icc (xl, yl) (xh, yh)).image (embed n) | x ∈ C} := by

The collection of points between `(xl, yl, n)` and `(xh, yh, n)` that are also in `C` has exactly
`xh + yh + 1 - (xl + yl)` elements.
In other words, this collection must be a maximal chain relative to the interval it is contained in.
Alternatively speaking, it has the same size as any maximal chain in that interval.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/AharoniKorman/Variant8a1b825a290fa3fe872eebffb11772fd16fd80ba9ab328484ff9ae14691b7366.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/AharoniKorman/Variant8a1b825a290fa3fe872eebffb11772fd16fd80ba9ab328484ff9ae14691b7366.lean#L624).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3eea7e4bd418a2e1ae42665cdf464a2230815e33` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
