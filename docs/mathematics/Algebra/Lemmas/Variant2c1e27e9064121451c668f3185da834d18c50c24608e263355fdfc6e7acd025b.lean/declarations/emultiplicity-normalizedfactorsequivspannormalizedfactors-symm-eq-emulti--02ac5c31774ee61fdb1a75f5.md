## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:212a8988-f797-168b-642a-c37537775373`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1109–1127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem emultiplicity_normalizedFactorsEquivSpanNormalizedFactors_symm_eq_emultiplicity {r : R}
    (hr : r ≠ 0) (I : { I : Ideal R | I ∈ normalizedFactors (span ({r} : Set R)) }) :
    emultiplicity ((normalizedFactorsEquivSpanNormalizedFactors hr).symm I : R) r =
      emultiplicity (I : Ideal R) (span {r}) := by
  obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := (normalizedFactorsEquivSpanNormalizedFactors hr).surjective I
  obtain ⟨a, ha⟩ := x
  rw [hx.symm, Equiv.symm_apply_apply, Subtype.coe_mk,
    emultiplicity_normalizedFactorsEquivSpanNormalizedFactors_eq_emultiplicity hr ha]

alias _root_.emultiplicity_normalizedFactorsEquivSpanNormalizedFactors_symm_eq_emultiplicity :=
  emultiplicity_normalizedFactorsEquivSpanNormalizedFactors_symm_eq_emultiplicity

variable [DecidableEq R]

/-- The bijection between the set of prime factors of the ideal `⟨r⟩` and the set of prime factors
  of `r` preserves `count` of the corresponding multisets. See
  `multiplicity_normalizedFactorsEquivSpanNormalizedFactors_eq_multiplicity` for the version
  stated in terms of multiplicity. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Lemmas/Variant2c1e27e9064121451c668f3185da834d18c50c24608e263355fdfc6e7acd025b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Lemmas/Variant2c1e27e9064121451c668f3185da834d18c50c24608e263355fdfc6e7acd025b.lean#L1109).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `94d5ba1be47343d644ff4e3215a178968a16025e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
