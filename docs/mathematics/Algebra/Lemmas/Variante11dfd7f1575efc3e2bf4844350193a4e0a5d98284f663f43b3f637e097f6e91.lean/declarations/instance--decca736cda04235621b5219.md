## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:07cd088e0e072dd0fbc47e0f5b4fb8a06394097b04e9fddff980e33076c56558`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 326–342.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance : StrongNormalizedGCDMonoid (Ideal A) :=
  { strongNormalizationMonoid with
    gcd := (· ⊔ ·)
    gcd_dvd_left := fun _ _ => by simpa only [dvd_iff_le] using le_sup_left
    gcd_dvd_right := fun _ _ => by simpa only [dvd_iff_le] using le_sup_right
    dvd_gcd := by
      simp only [dvd_iff_le]
      exact fun h1 h2 => @sup_le (Ideal A) _ _ _ _ h1 h2
    lcm := (· ⊓ ·)
    lcm_zero_left := fun _ => by simp only [zero_eq_bot, bot_inf_eq]
    lcm_zero_right := fun _ => by simp only [zero_eq_bot, inf_bot_eq]
    gcd_mul_lcm := fun _ _ => by rw [associated_iff_eq, sup_mul_inf]
    normalize_gcd := fun _ _ => normalize_eq _
    normalize_lcm := fun _ _ => normalize_eq _ }

-- In fact, any lawful gcd and lcm would equal sup and inf respectively.
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Lemmas/Variante11dfd7f1575efc3e2bf4844350193a4e0a5d98284f663f43b3f637e097f6e91.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Lemmas/Variante11dfd7f1575efc3e2bf4844350193a4e0a5d98284f663f43b3f637e097f6e91.lean#L326).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `686c0c8b6fa489e9b367a44f2bf30d2992107068` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
