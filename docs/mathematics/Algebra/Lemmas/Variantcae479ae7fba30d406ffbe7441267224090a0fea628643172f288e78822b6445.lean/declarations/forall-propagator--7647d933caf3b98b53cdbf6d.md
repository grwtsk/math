## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0227b595-e96f-8790-cea7-d05410d51cd3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 156–160.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem forall_propagator (p : Prop) (q : p → Prop) (q' : Prop) (h₁ : p = True) (h₂ : q (of_eq_true h₁) = q') : (∀ hp : p, q hp) = q' := by
  apply propext; apply Iff.intro
  · intro h'; exact Eq.mp h₂ (h' (of_eq_true h₁))
  · intro h'; intros; exact Eq.mpr h₂ h'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Lemmas/Variantcae479ae7fba30d406ffbe7441267224090a0fea628643172f288e78822b6445.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Lemmas/Variantcae479ae7fba30d406ffbe7441267224090a0fea628643172f288e78822b6445.lean#L156).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9a7e3c1af8bcbbceb8c8c4e2a536df9c8f3fcee4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
