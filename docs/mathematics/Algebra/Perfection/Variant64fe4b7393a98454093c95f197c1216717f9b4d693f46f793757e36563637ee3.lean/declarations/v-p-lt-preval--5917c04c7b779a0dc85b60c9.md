## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b52dc614-9d9a-8fad-cbf4-04c4a0114961`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 409–415.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem v_p_lt_preVal {x : ModP O p} : v p < preVal K v O p x ↔ x ≠ 0 := by
  refine ⟨fun h hx => by rw [hx, preVal_zero] at h; exact not_lt_zero' h,
    fun h => lt_of_not_le fun hp => h ?_⟩
  obtain ⟨r, rfl⟩ := Ideal.Quotient.mk_surjective x
  rw [preVal_mk hv h, ← map_natCast (algebraMap O K) p, hv.le_iff_dvd] at hp
  · rw [Ideal.Quotient.eq_zero_iff_mem, Ideal.mem_span_singleton]; exact hp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Perfection/Variant64fe4b7393a98454093c95f197c1216717f9b4d693f46f793757e36563637ee3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Perfection/Variant64fe4b7393a98454093c95f197c1216717f9b4d693f46f793757e36563637ee3.lean#L409).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c38d240a51a0fbbab92219e1e7a1730ae8625e1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
