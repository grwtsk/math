## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:374840d56532be96c5ed7044b4dd34bba6b7d36c660b9ec6fcdaef7f5b660097`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 34–41.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Monoid.perfection (M : Type u₁) [CommMonoid M] (p : ℕ) : Submonoid (ℕ → M) where
  carrier := { f | ∀ n, f (n + 1) ^ p = f n }
  one_mem' _ := one_pow _
  mul_mem' hf hg n := (mul_pow _ _ _).trans <| congr_arg₂ _ (hf n) (hg n)

/-- The perfection of a ring `R` with characteristic `p`, as a subsemiring,
defined to be the projective limit of `R` using the Frobenius maps `R → R`
indexed by the natural numbers, implemented as `{ f : ℕ → R | ∀ n, f (n + 1) ^ p = f n }`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Perfection/Variantf5746eab3cb265bee8e260621ed3d8f67f7d7b78e7b26ea21d24b61e1a9ebb9e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Perfection/Variantf5746eab3cb265bee8e260621ed3d8f67f7d7b78e7b26ea21d24b61e1a9ebb9e.lean#L34).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `557787c8f32425dd40b7442d9826510c08600c5b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
