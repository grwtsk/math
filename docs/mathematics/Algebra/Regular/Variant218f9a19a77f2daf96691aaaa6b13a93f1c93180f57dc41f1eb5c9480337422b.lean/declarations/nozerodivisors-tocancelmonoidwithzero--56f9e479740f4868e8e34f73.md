## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1b42cbdcc24055a9362ddd817fa684191ae6bc23d9eab13280bb7aea3b5d98f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 46–55.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev NoZeroDivisors.toCancelMonoidWithZero [Ring α] [NoZeroDivisors α] : CancelMonoidWithZero α :=
  { (by infer_instance : MonoidWithZero α) with
    mul_left_cancel_of_ne_zero := fun ha =>
      @IsRegular.left _ _ _ (isRegular_of_ne_zero' ha) _ _,
    mul_right_cancel_of_ne_zero := fun hb =>
      @IsRegular.right _ _ _ (isRegular_of_ne_zero' hb) _ _ }

/-- A commutative ring with no zero divisors is a `CancelCommMonoidWithZero`.

Note this is not an instance as it forms a typeclass loop. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Regular/Variant218f9a19a77f2daf96691aaaa6b13a93f1c93180f57dc41f1eb5c9480337422b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Regular/Variant218f9a19a77f2daf96691aaaa6b13a93f1c93180f57dc41f1eb5c9480337422b.lean#L46).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `06a8844b88ad966f78ee6a8384ef312155fd7cc1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
