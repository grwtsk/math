## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ecdaf29c-9b1a-6583-eb53-0dedf78437e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 286–293.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem roots_expand_pow :
    (expand R (p ^ n) f).roots = p ^ n • f.roots.map (iterateFrobeniusEquiv R p n).symm := by
  classical
  refine ext' fun r ↦ ?_
  rw [count_roots, rootMultiplicity_expand_pow, ← count_roots, count_nsmul, count_map,
    count_eq_card_filter_eq]; congr; ext
  exact (iterateFrobeniusEquiv R p n).eq_symm_apply.symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Perfect/Variant4eefcc1fb77d396453eee54df1e24a633d43afedcb5e9f7fa45e3ff95210db22.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Perfect/Variant4eefcc1fb77d396453eee54df1e24a633d43afedcb5e9f7fa45e3ff95210db22.lean#L286).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6aea37303222861166b3e97ad53e0fe5fb9880d0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
