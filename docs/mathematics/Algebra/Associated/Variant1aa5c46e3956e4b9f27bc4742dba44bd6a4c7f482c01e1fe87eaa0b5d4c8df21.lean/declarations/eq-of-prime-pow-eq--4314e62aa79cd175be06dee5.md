## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:523df67c-e626-e712-f1be-af23258e4be0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 725–735.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_of_prime_pow_eq' (hp₁ : Prime p₁) (hp₂ : Prime p₂) (hk₁ : 0 < k₂)
    (h : p₁ ^ k₁ = p₂ ^ k₂) : p₁ = p₂ := by
  rw [← associated_iff_eq] at h ⊢
  apply h.of_pow_associated_of_prime' hp₁ hp₂ hk₁
#align eq_of_prime_pow_eq' eq_of_prime_pow_eq'

end UniqueUnits₀

/-- The quotient of a monoid by the `Associated` relation. Two elements `x` and `y`
  are associated iff there is a unit `u` such that `x * u = y`. There is a natural
  monoid structure on `Associates α`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Associated/Variant1aa5c46e3956e4b9f27bc4742dba44bd6a4c7f482c01e1fe87eaa0b5d4c8df21.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Associated/Variant1aa5c46e3956e4b9f27bc4742dba44bd6a4c7f482c01e1fe87eaa0b5d4c8df21.lean#L725).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `75f63d9ac428c65c2001996144e24142f0ac085f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
