## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b57de2f0-5a5b-bc10-0f32-145bc1b081cc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1107–1133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem one_or_eq_of_le_of_prime : ∀ p m : Associates α, Prime p → m ≤ p → m = 1 ∨ m = p
  | p, m, ⟨hp0, _, h⟩, ⟨d, r⟩ => by
    have dvd_rfl' : p ∣ m * d := by rw[r]
    rw [r]
    match h m d dvd_rfl' with
    | Or.inl h' =>
      by_cases h : m = 0
      case pos =>
        simp [h, zero_mul]
      case neg =>
        rw [r] at h'
        have : m * d ≤ m * 1 := by simpa using h'
        have : d ≤ 1 := Associates.le_of_mul_le_mul_left m d 1 ‹m ≠ 0› this
        have : d = 1 := bot_unique this
        simp [this]
    | Or.inr h' =>
        by_cases h : d = 0
        case pos =>
          rw [r] at hp0
          have : m * d = 0 := by rw [h]; simp
          contradiction
        case neg =>

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Associated/Variant13704adf1a994106748ee7f58c39ec9d9133e72ebb809a99f7d53baa27978ffd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Associated/Variant13704adf1a994106748ee7f58c39ec9d9133e72ebb809a99f7d53baa27978ffd.lean#L1107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `09c4c8e33197047917b44a6b5223ced8339263e9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
