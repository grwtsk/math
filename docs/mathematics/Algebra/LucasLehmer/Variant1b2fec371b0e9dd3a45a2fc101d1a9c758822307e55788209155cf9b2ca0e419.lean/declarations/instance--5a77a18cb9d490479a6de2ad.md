## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cadd7aa55972fe5e3c6d035f3a49912ad0d72f94f5b78c4c349b865a4d8c9f1a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 337–340.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : CommRing (X q) :=
  { (inferInstance : Ring (X q)) with
    mul_comm := fun _ _ ↦ by ext <;> dsimp <;> ring }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/LucasLehmer/Variant1b2fec371b0e9dd3a45a2fc101d1a9c758822307e55788209155cf9b2ca0e419.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LucasLehmer/Variant1b2fec371b0e9dd3a45a2fc101d1a9c758822307e55788209155cf9b2ca0e419.lean#L337).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `849399954f3d8406be775591d95ea7a7e5ef9c83` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
