## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c1132343f942674c0bc97c79590c3985c9984fbe01872d1929af6387a3aa2c25`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 594–633.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-!
This implementation works successfully to prove `(2^4423 - 1).Prime`,
and all the Mersenne primes up to this point appear in [Archive/Examples/MersennePrimes.lean].
These can be calculated nearly instantly, and `(2^9689 - 1).Prime` only fails due to deep
recursion.

(Note by kmill: the following notes were for the Lean 3 version. They seem like they could still
be useful, so I'm leaving them here.)

There's still low hanging fruit available to do faster computations
based on the formula
```
n ≡ (n % 2^p) + (n / 2^p) [MOD 2^p - 1]
```
and the fact that `% 2^p` and `/ 2^p` can be very efficient on the binary representation.
Someone should do this, too!

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/LucasLehmer/Variant3fbf138776b24e178715b45c8b3e4c242b2ac6d29dc7579df543a201c02eec6e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LucasLehmer/Variant3fbf138776b24e178715b45c8b3e4c242b2ac6d29dc7579df543a201c02eec6e.lean#L594).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `57a29880b082de9417c229bbe3ecdb51649a86bd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
