## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cc293cd7d135d81add17c793d864564f43174aeb4d03a83942368cb60dab07e7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 65–80.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def PerfectClosure : Type u :=
  Quot (PerfectClosure.R K p)

end

namespace PerfectClosure

variable (K : Type u)

section Ring

variable [CommRing K] (p : ℕ) [Fact p.Prime] [CharP K p]

/-- `PerfectClosure.mk K p (n, x)` for `n : ℕ` and `x : K` is an element of `PerfectClosure K p`,
viewed as `x ^ (p ^ -n)`. Every element of `PerfectClosure K p` is of this form
(`PerfectClosure.mk_surjective`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/PerfectClosure/Variant41183d5e49ae251b4dba671832f818822a28b34f8d315f9c000fc83f30cb9ebd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/PerfectClosure/Variant41183d5e49ae251b4dba671832f818822a28b34f8d315f9c000fc83f30cb9ebd.lean#L65).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `62e8cede2da3b4735071dd87d11e2fa79366b17a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
