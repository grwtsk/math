## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:738f07f64cd1b010d8746dae84a4925b755efb29376f0482a7faf903b8a34fa2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 139–149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instMul : Mul (PerfectClosure K p) :=
  ⟨Quot.lift
      (fun x : ℕ × K =>
        Quot.lift
          (fun y : ℕ × K =>
            mk K p (x.1 + y.1, (frobenius K p)^[y.1] x.2 * (frobenius K p)^[x.1] y.2))
          (mul_aux_right K p x))
      fun x1 x2 (H : R K p x1 x2) =>
      funext fun e => Quot.inductionOn e fun y => mul_aux_left K p x1 x2 y H⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/PerfectClosure/Variant12232e57a0c3b04ba1737b5f94edbd5286b571a3a55faa3130194005597f3ad3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/PerfectClosure/Variant12232e57a0c3b04ba1737b5f94edbd5286b571a3a55faa3130194005597f3ad3.lean#L139).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e2c3a45e4a6356d1feb76bc8bfb787e7690b655` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
