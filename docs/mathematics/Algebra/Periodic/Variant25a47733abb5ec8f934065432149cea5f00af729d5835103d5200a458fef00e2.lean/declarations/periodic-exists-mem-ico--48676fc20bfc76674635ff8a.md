## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:35af0df4-bbcd-1efe-d79f-ce15100d85af`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Periodic.exists_mem_Ico₀ [AddCommGroup α] [LinearOrder α] [IsOrderedAddMonoid α]
    [Archimedean α] (h : Periodic f c)
    (hc : 0 < c) (x) : ∃ y ∈ Ico 0 c, f x = f y :=
  let ⟨n, H, _⟩ := existsUnique_zsmul_near_of_pos' hc x
  ⟨x - n • c, H, (h.sub_zsmul_eq n).symm⟩

/-- If a function `f` is `Periodic` with positive period `c`, then for all `x` there exists some
  `y ∈ Ico a (a + c)` such that `f x = f y`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Periodic/Variant25a47733abb5ec8f934065432149cea5f00af729d5835103d5200a458fef00e2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Periodic/Variant25a47733abb5ec8f934065432149cea5f00af729d5835103d5200a458fef00e2.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `754c158183f97aea265791413a1b4e62ee1977d6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
