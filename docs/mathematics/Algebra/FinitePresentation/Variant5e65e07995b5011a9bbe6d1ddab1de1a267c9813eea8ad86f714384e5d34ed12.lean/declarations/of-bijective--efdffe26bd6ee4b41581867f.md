## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e0f482d3-b3d7-628c-99c4-51ee56a51b2b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 436–441.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma of_bijective {f : A →+* B} (hf : Function.Bijective f) : f.FinitePresentation :=
  .of_surjective f hf.2 <| by
    have : ker f = ⊥ := by rw [← RingHom.injective_iff_ker_eq_bot]; exact hf.1
    rw [this]
    exact Submodule.fg_bot

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/FinitePresentation/Variant5e65e07995b5011a9bbe6d1ddab1de1a267c9813eea8ad86f714384e5d34ed12.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/FinitePresentation/Variant5e65e07995b5011a9bbe6d1ddab1de1a267c9813eea8ad86f714384e5d34ed12.lean#L436).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fe07b8e6a703c07f11da53a4e47663c372bc129b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
