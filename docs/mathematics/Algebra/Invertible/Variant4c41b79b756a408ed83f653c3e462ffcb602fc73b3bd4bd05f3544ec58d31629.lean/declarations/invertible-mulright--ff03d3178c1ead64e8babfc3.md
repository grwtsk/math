## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bf8323d0a2e497bcb5430bb6ad8cf69fe5aa3e8d11c464bd6f8cf14464328769`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 419–435.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Invertible.mulRight (a : α) {b : α} (_ : Invertible b) : Invertible a ≃ Invertible (a * b) where
  toFun _ := invertibleMul a b
  invFun _ := invertibleOfMulInvertible _ b
  left_inv _ := Subsingleton.elim _ _
  right_inv _ := Subsingleton.elim _ _
#align invertible.mul_right Invertible.mulRight
#align invertible.mul_right_apply Invertible.mulRight_apply
#align invertible.mul_right_symm_apply Invertible.mulRight_symm_apply

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Invertible/Variant4c41b79b756a408ed83f653c3e462ffcb602fc73b3bd4bd05f3544ec58d31629.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Invertible/Variant4c41b79b756a408ed83f653c3e462ffcb602fc73b3bd4bd05f3544ec58d31629.lean#L419).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ed25872c35c34ee2ed71a5fb8ba8212677f21f08` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
