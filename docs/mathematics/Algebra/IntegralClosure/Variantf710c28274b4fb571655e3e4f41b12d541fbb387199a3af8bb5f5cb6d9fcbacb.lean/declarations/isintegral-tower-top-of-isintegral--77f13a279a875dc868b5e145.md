## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9c415b32-9212-b576-9c49-448938029c31`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1101–1107.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isIntegral_tower_top_of_isIntegral {x : B} (h : IsIntegral R x) : IsIntegral A x := by
  rcases h with ⟨p, ⟨hp, hp'⟩⟩
  refine' ⟨p.map (algebraMap R A), ⟨hp.map (algebraMap R A), _⟩⟩
  rw [IsScalarTower.algebraMap_eq R A B, ← eval₂_map] at hp'
  exact hp'
#align is_integral_tower_top_of_is_integral isIntegral_tower_top_of_isIntegral

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/IntegralClosure/Variantf710c28274b4fb571655e3e4f41b12d541fbb387199a3af8bb5f5cb6d9fcbacb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/IntegralClosure/Variantf710c28274b4fb571655e3e4f41b12d541fbb387199a3af8bb5f5cb6d9fcbacb.lean#L1101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a187f8eb8be9b458ae2944e1e518c2e6cc9c1c9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
