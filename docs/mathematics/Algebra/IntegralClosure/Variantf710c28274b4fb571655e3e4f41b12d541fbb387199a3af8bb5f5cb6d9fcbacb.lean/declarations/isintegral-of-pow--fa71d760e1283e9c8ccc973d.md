## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f54499a9-6c48-ebd5-6716-3a06b9749c4e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 564–574.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isIntegral_of_pow {x : A} {n : ℕ} (hn : 0 < n) (hx : IsIntegral R <| x ^ n) :
    IsIntegral R x := by
  rcases hx with ⟨p, ⟨hmonic, heval⟩⟩
  exact
    ⟨expand R n p, Monic.expand hn hmonic, by
      rwa [eval₂_eq_eval_map, map_expand, expand_eval, ← eval₂_eq_eval_map]⟩
#align is_integral_of_pow isIntegral_of_pow

variable (R A)

/-- The integral closure of R in an R-algebra A. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/IntegralClosure/Variantf710c28274b4fb571655e3e4f41b12d541fbb387199a3af8bb5f5cb6d9fcbacb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/IntegralClosure/Variantf710c28274b4fb571655e3e4f41b12d541fbb387199a3af8bb5f5cb6d9fcbacb.lean#L564).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a187f8eb8be9b458ae2944e1e518c2e6cc9c1c9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
