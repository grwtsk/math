## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:61237482385db4156b13efceacd33d9f0e80e0e9562ceab8ce8f22bff5e02bce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 30–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected noncomputable def hasDistribNeg [Mul α] [HasDistribNeg α] : HasDistribNeg (Set α) where
  __ := Set.involutiveNeg
  neg_mul _ _ := by simp_rw [← image_neg_eq_neg]; exact image2_image_left_comm neg_mul
  mul_neg _ _ := by simp_rw [← image_neg_eq_neg]; exact image_image2_right_comm mul_neg

scoped[Pointwise] attribute [instance] Set.hasDistribNeg

section Distrib
variable [Distrib α] (s t u : Set α)

/-!
Note that `Set α` is not a `Distrib` because `s * t + s * u` has cross terms that `s * (t + u)`
lacks.
-/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Set/Variant172020b0fbc96530f386f85af624f2bf95d6968be9054cf9467a7c962f18e24f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Set/Variant172020b0fbc96530f386f85af624f2bf95d6968be9054cf9467a7c962f18e24f.lean#L30).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ae35438aaade21fb90ee67b5702eb9f60b3601f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
