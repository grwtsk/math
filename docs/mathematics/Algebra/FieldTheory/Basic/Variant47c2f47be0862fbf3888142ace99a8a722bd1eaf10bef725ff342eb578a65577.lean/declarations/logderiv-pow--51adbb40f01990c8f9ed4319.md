## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:52dbf812-7bbd-e9e8-ede5-39604b86b7af`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 54–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma logDeriv_pow (n : ℕ) (a : R) : logDeriv (a ^ n) = n * logDeriv a := by
  induction n with
  | zero => simp
  | succ n h2 =>
    obtain rfl | hb := eq_or_ne a 0
    · simp
    · rw [Nat.cast_add, Nat.cast_one, add_mul, one_mul, ← h2, pow_succ, logDeriv_mul] <;>
      simp [hb]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/FieldTheory/Basic/Variant47c2f47be0862fbf3888142ace99a8a722bd1eaf10bef725ff342eb578a65577.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/FieldTheory/Basic/Variant47c2f47be0862fbf3888142ace99a8a722bd1eaf10bef725ff342eb578a65577.lean#L54).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `509e9c3c86c1b5622f611f58a41c63daf7f14964` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
