## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bd6e58863b83209f3ef7a2f59702a73aba545072d207b33b4e80b6934dddb371`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 329–338.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance smulCommClass_right [SMul X Y] [SMul L Y] [SMulCommClass X L Y]
    (F : IntermediateField K L) : SMulCommClass X F Y :=
  inferInstanceAs (SMulCommClass X F.toSubfield Y)

-- note: giving this instance the default priority may trigger trouble with synthesizing instances
-- for field extensions with more than one intermediate field. For example, in a field extension
-- `E/F`, and with `K₁ ≤ K₂` of type `IntermediateField F E`, this instance will cause a search
-- for `IsScalarTower K₁ K₂ E` to trigger a search for `IsScalarTower E K₂ E` which may
-- take a long time to fail.
/-- Note that this provides `IsScalarTower F K K` which is needed by `smul_mul_assoc`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/FieldTheory/Basic/Variant278035fbabb1d2823072bca6363581530a58fa6b636e3d504114f29f3a7a5e56.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/FieldTheory/Basic/Variant278035fbabb1d2823072bca6363581530a58fa6b636e3d504114f29f3a7a5e56.lean#L329).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f101ab8fece2d72d333829ede495a76ced96dd1d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
