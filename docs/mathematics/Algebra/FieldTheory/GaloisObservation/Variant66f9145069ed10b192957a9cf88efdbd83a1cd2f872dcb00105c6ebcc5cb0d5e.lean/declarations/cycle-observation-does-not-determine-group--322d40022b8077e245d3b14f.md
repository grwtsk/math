## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0e7ad499-eb27-3532-2671-1d853d4a0ddc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–112.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cycle_observation_does_not_determine_group :
    ∃ H K : Subgroup (Perm (Fin 2)), H ≠ K ∧
      (1 : Perm (Fin 2)) ∈ H ∧ (1 : Perm (Fin 2)) ∈ K := by
  refine ⟨⊥, ⊤, bot_ne_top, Subgroup.one_mem _, Subgroup.one_mem _⟩

end FormalResearch.SUCAS.GaloisObservation
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/FieldTheory/GaloisObservation/Variant66f9145069ed10b192957a9cf88efdbd83a1cd2f872dcb00105c6ebcc5cb0d5e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/FieldTheory/GaloisObservation/Variant66f9145069ed10b192957a9cf88efdbd83a1cd2f872dcb00105c6ebcc5cb0d5e.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6ce4aae81e6024b1cce1f43d52fa1ba6693d445c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
