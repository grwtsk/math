## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dc263c2d-05df-cd95-3ed6-e08956751419`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–88.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- A ring `R` is *Henselian* at an ideal `I` if the following condition holds:
for every polynomial `f` over `R`, with a *simple* root `a₀` over the quotient ring `R/I`,
there exists a lift `a : R` of `a₀` that is a root of `f`.

(Here, saying that a root `b` of a polynomial `g` is *simple* means that `g.derivative.eval b` is a
unit. Warning: if `R/I` is not a field then it is not enough to assume that `g` has a factorization
into monic linear factors in which `X - b` shows up only once; for example `1` is not a simple root
of `X^2-1` over `ℤ/4ℤ`.) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Henselian/Variant7642d867a5c7c04438bac1e51341c3b9d0f8631858797668228e48e8577904f6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Henselian/Variant7642d867a5c7c04438bac1e51341c3b9d0f8631858797668228e48e8577904f6.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a31195d7ff266e651ed63818fe2e0812c24d920` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
