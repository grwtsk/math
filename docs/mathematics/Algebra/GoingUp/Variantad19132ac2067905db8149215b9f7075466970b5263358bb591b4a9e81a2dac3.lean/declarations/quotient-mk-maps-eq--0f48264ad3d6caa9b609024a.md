## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3c1fc30b-1b2e-7b47-7fd1-9bafc7cf9b08`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 92–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

      (Ideal.quotientMap (map (mapRingHom (Quotient.mk (P.comap (C : R →+* R[X])))) P)
            (mapRingHom (Quotient.mk (P.comap (C : R →+* R[X])))) le_comap_map).comp

  simp

/-- This technical lemma asserts the existence of a polynomial `p` in an ideal `P ⊂ R[x]`
that is non-zero in the quotient `R / (P ∩ R) [x]`.  The assumptions are equivalent to
`P ≠ 0` and `P ∩ R = (0)`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/GoingUp/Variantad19132ac2067905db8149215b9f7075466970b5263358bb591b4a9e81a2dac3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GoingUp/Variantad19132ac2067905db8149215b9f7075466970b5263358bb591b4a9e81a2dac3.lean#L92).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `38effe378f18fa023464dcbc1e58e32d389bf789` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
