## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:401e70f5-5835-27cc-04d6-3f7213d4ed15`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 352–366.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma map_eq_top_iff {R S} [CommRing R] [CommRing S]
    (f : R →+* S) {I : Ideal R} (hf₁ : Function.Injective f) (hf₂ : f.IsIntegral) :
    I.map f = ⊤ ↔ I = ⊤ :=
  map_eq_top_iff_of_ker_le f (by simp [(RingHom.injective_iff_ker_eq_bot f).mp hf₁]) hf₂

end IsDomain

section IsIntegral

variable {A : Type*} [CommRing A] {B : Type*} [CommRing B] [Algebra A B] [Algebra.IsIntegral A B]
  (P : Ideal B) (p : Ideal A) [P.LiesOver p]

variable (A) in
/-- If `B` is an integral `A`-algebra, `P` is a maximal ideal of `B`, then the pull back of
  `P` is also a maximal ideal of `A`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/GoingUp/Variant687cca1a6b033907bc9e82691e56d6adfa4372786c1fc3e11be196a08937dcfc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GoingUp/Variant687cca1a6b033907bc9e82691e56d6adfa4372786c1fc3e11be196a08937dcfc.lean#L352).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c60f1dcc7ff97877c3f0d91529924042425f5cee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
