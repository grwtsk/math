## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5ab214e8-b3eb-2138-06c6-e6c6e964ef44`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 332–337.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_ideal_over_maximal_of_isIntegral [Algebra.IsIntegral R S]
    (P : Ideal R) [P_max : IsMaximal P] (hP : RingHom.ker (algebraMap R S) ≤ P) :
    ∃ Q : Ideal S, IsMaximal Q ∧ Q.comap (algebraMap R S) = P := by
  obtain ⟨Q, -, Q_prime, hQ⟩ := exists_ideal_over_prime_of_isIntegral P ⊥ hP
  exact ⟨Q, isMaximal_of_isIntegral_of_isMaximal_comap _ (hQ.symm ▸ P_max), hQ⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/GoingUp/Variant687cca1a6b033907bc9e82691e56d6adfa4372786c1fc3e11be196a08937dcfc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GoingUp/Variant687cca1a6b033907bc9e82691e56d6adfa4372786c1fc3e11be196a08937dcfc.lean#L332).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c60f1dcc7ff97877c3f0d91529924042425f5cee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
