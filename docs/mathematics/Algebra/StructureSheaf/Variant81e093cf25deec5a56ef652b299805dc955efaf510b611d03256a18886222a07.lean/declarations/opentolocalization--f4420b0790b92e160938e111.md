## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6049f734184ee24080bd3953aeac87e528b37a30ed47d30d5be1083a781b5bbe`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 233–244.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def openToLocalization (U : Opens (ProjectiveSpectrum.top 𝒜)) (x : ProjectiveSpectrum.top 𝒜)
    (hx : x ∈ U) : (Proj.structureSheaf 𝒜).1.obj (op U) ⟶ CommRingCat.of (at x) :=
  CommRingCat.ofHom
  { toFun s := (s.1 ⟨x, hx⟩ :)
    map_one' := rfl
    map_mul' _ _ := rfl
    map_zero' := rfl
    map_add' _ _ := rfl }

/-- The ring homomorphism from the stalk of the structure sheaf of `Proj` at a point corresponding
to a homogeneous prime ideal `x` to the *homogeneous localization* at `x`,
formed by gluing the `openToLocalization` maps. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/StructureSheaf/Variant81e093cf25deec5a56ef652b299805dc955efaf510b611d03256a18886222a07.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/StructureSheaf/Variant81e093cf25deec5a56ef652b299805dc955efaf510b611d03256a18886222a07.lean#L233).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1e5cc4c679f3cd3fa275ed3e4681cf0a74ce6013` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
