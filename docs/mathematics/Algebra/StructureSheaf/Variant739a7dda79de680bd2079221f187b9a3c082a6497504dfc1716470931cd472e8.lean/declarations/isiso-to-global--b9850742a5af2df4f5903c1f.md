## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8110110d41c06ebc8878758de0c36b3ad5196db14c47cf8b37c3033552c5d644`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 907–915.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isIso_to_global : IsIso (toOpen R ⊤) := by
  let hom := CommRingCat.ofHom (algebraMap R (Localization.Away (1 : R)))
  haveI : IsIso hom :=
    (IsLocalization.atOne R (Localization.Away (1 : R))).toRingEquiv.toCommRingCatIso.isIso_hom
  rw [to_global_factors R]
  infer_instance

/-- The ring isomorphism between the ring `R` and the global sections `Γ(X, 𝒪ₓ)`. -/
@[simps! inv]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/StructureSheaf/Variant739a7dda79de680bd2079221f187b9a3c082a6497504dfc1716470931cd472e8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/StructureSheaf/Variant739a7dda79de680bd2079221f187b9a3c082a6497504dfc1716470931cd472e8.lean#L907).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b2b8f88a0a3366a26e204ada4a5f97b22cc22de5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
