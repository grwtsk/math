## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6bdc9b52d5474ec3deaf47eb9feac52d6b27761df8f1dc0b554392fa980a40f6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 134–156.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def isFractionPrelocal : PrelocalPredicate (Localizations R) where
  pred {U} f := IsFraction f
  res := by rintro V U i f ⟨r, s, w⟩; exact ⟨r, s, fun x => w (i x)⟩
#align algebraic_geometry.structure_sheaf.is_fraction_prelocal AlgebraicGeometry.StructureSheaf.isFractionPrelocal

/-- We will define the structure sheaf as
the subsheaf of all dependent functions in `Π x : U, Localizations R x`
consisting of those functions which can locally be expressed as a ratio of
(the images in the localization of) elements of `R`.

Quoting Hartshorne:

For an open set $U ⊆ Spec A$, we define $𝒪(U)$ to be the set of functions
$s : U → ⨆_{𝔭 ∈ U} A_𝔭$, such that $s(𝔭) ∈ A_𝔭$ for each $𝔭$,
and such that $s$ is locally a quotient of elements of $A$:
to be precise, we require that for each $𝔭 ∈ U$, there is a neighborhood $V$ of $𝔭$,
contained in $U$, and elements $a, f ∈ A$, such that for each $𝔮 ∈ V, f ∉ 𝔮$,
and $s(𝔮) = a/f$ in $A_𝔮$.

Now Hartshorne had the disadvantage of not knowing about dependent functions,
so we replace his circumlocution about functions into a disjoint union with
`Π x : U, Localizations x`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/StructureSheaf/Variant1d3097dfba23d8ceb8dedebefc106768284ee42019c77ce1946e071568e6e37e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/StructureSheaf/Variant1d3097dfba23d8ceb8dedebefc106768284ee42019c77ce1946e071568e6e37e.lean#L134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77c38c8ba20bb8be112e47215887715d2f05b8a8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
