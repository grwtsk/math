## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dcfb3645-6e00-db4c-c239-9cf835c33a2c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 560–568.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
public lemma algebraMap_germ
    (U : Opens (PrimeSpectrum.Top R)) (x : PrimeSpectrum.Top R) (hxU : x ∈ U) :
    CommRingCat.ofHom (algebraMap R Γ(R, U)) ≫ (structurePresheafInCommRingCat R).germ U x hxU =
      toStalk R x := by
  dsimp [toStalk]
  rw [← (structurePresheafInCommRingCat R).germ_res (homOfLE (le_top : U ≤ ⊤)) _ hxU]
  rfl

public
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/StructureSheaf/Variant13e7f424ee59bd4be8cd1166a150be4634c183cb213ceaf69bba19d1aec9105e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/StructureSheaf/Variant13e7f424ee59bd4be8cd1166a150be4634c183cb213ceaf69bba19d1aec9105e.lean#L560).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `08b659a0a3f3a16341f764ca121c95b64ce83209` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
