## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dc6cccad-d101-d8d3-70a1-dba2c1bf9fbc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 551–559.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Algebra.IsIntegral.tower_bot [IsDomain S] [Algebra R S] [Algebra R T] [Algebra S T]
    [IsTorsionFree S T] [Nontrivial T] [IsScalarTower R S T]
    [h : Algebra.IsIntegral R T] : Algebra.IsIntegral R S where
  isIntegral := by
    apply RingHom.IsIntegral.tower_bot (algebraMap R S) (algebraMap S T)
      (FaithfulSMul.algebraMap_injective S T)
    rw [← IsScalarTower.algebraMap_eq R S T]
    exact h.isIntegral

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant496d3db0b3377f23da19e7a3e5f2f6a8d457514e6dcf1fcf4d68a996f20cfe0f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant496d3db0b3377f23da19e7a3e5f2f6a8d457514e6dcf1fcf4d68a996f20cfe0f.lean#L551).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d741265778a63326a2a3983caf123de767401116` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
