## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:73473a21-14b0-7582-00f5-d9a3eb32840b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 648–656.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Algebra.ker_algebraMap_isMaximal_of_isIntegral (k : Type*) [Field k] [Algebra R k]
    [Algebra.IsIntegral R k] : (RingHom.ker (algebraMap R k)).IsMaximal := by
  have := Ideal.bot_isMaximal (K := k)
  rw [RingHom.ker, Ideal.Quotient.maximal_ideal_iff_isField_quotient]
  exact isField_of_isIntegral_of_isField Ideal.algebraMap_quotient_injective
    (Ideal.Quotient.field _).toIsField

end Algebra

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant496d3db0b3377f23da19e7a3e5f2f6a8d457514e6dcf1fcf4d68a996f20cfe0f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant496d3db0b3377f23da19e7a3e5f2f6a8d457514e6dcf1fcf4d68a996f20cfe0f.lean#L648).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d741265778a63326a2a3983caf123de767401116` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
