## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4106eb7f-0738-9237-be83-8ba7443380e3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 286–295.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem bot_lt_of_maximal (M : Ideal R) [hm : M.IsMaximal] (non_field : ¬IsField R) : ⊥ < M := by
  rcases Ring.not_isField_iff_exists_ideal_bot_lt_and_lt_top.1 non_field with ⟨I, Ibot, Itop⟩
  constructor; · simp
  intro mle
  apply lt_irrefl (⊤ : Ideal R)
  have : M = ⊥ := eq_bot_iff.mpr mle
  rw [← this] at Ibot
  rwa [hm.1.2 I Ibot] at Itop

end Ideal
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant1512965b0a3f4a3caaba25df4bdd2a84d68d632d5913a339d3d7db3af7ebef28.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant1512965b0a3f4a3caaba25df4bdd2a84d68d632d5913a339d3d7db3af7ebef28.lean#L286).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `681a91de84c5799417c5a4c35d9033ab6eb2d2df` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
