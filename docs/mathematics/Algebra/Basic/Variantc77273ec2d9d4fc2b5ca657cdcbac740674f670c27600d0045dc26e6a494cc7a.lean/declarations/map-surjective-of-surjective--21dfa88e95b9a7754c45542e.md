## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f425a16e-93cc-dc3f-8f19-53151c7ca915`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 277–287.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma mapₐ_surjective_of_surjective {f : A →ₐ[R] B} (a : A) [Away a Aₚ] [Away (f a) Bₚ]
    (hf : Function.Surjective f) : Function.Surjective (mapₐ Aₚ Bₚ f a) :=
  have : IsLocalization (Submonoid.map f.toRingHom (Submonoid.powers a)) Bₚ := by
    simp only [AlgHom.toRingHom_eq_coe, Submonoid.map_powers, RingHom.coe_coe]
    infer_instance
  IsLocalization.map_surjective_of_surjective _ _ _ hf

end Algebra

/-- Localizing the localization of `R` at `x` at the image of `y` is the same as localizing
`R` at `y * x`. See `IsLocalization.Away.mul'` for the `x * y` version. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantc77273ec2d9d4fc2b5ca657cdcbac740674f670c27600d0045dc26e6a494cc7a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantc77273ec2d9d4fc2b5ca657cdcbac740674f670c27600d0045dc26e6a494cc7a.lean#L277).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8ac0114b1e03d40f266eb5373f388d9ba55d7559` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
