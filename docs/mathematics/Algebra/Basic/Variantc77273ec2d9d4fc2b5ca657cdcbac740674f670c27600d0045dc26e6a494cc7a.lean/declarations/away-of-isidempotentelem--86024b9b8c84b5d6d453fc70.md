## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0583fb22-5026-e517-fc8c-e9aa82eebd69`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 419–428.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma away_of_isIdempotentElem {R S} [CommRing R] [CommRing S] [Algebra R S]
    {e : R} (he : IsIdempotentElem e)
    (H : RingHom.ker (algebraMap R S) = Ideal.span {1 - e})
    (H' : Function.Surjective (algebraMap R S)) :
    IsLocalization.Away e S :=
  away_of_isIdempotentElem_of_mul he (fun x y ↦ by
    rw [← sub_eq_zero, ← map_sub, ← RingHom.mem_ker, H, ← he.ker_toSpanSingleton_eq_span,
      LinearMap.mem_ker, LinearMap.toSpanSingleton_apply, sub_smul, sub_eq_zero]
    simp_rw [mul_comm e, smul_eq_mul]) H'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantc77273ec2d9d4fc2b5ca657cdcbac740674f670c27600d0045dc26e6a494cc7a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantc77273ec2d9d4fc2b5ca657cdcbac740674f670c27600d0045dc26e6a494cc7a.lean#L419).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8ac0114b1e03d40f266eb5373f388d9ba55d7559` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
