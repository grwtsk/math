## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a7aefbfa1f406092946020d1933a5fbdd44b3b4bb3c9ff8e68497392a8759108`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 61–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def equivCauchy : ℝ ≃ CauSeq.Completion.Cauchy (abs : ℚ → ℚ) :=
  ⟨Real.cauchy, Real.ofCauchy, fun ⟨_⟩ => rfl, fun _ => rfl⟩

-- irreducible doesn't work for instances: https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/issues/511
private irreducible_def zero : ℝ :=
  ⟨0⟩

private irreducible_def one : ℝ :=
  ⟨1⟩

private irreducible_def add : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
  | ⟨a⟩, ⟨b⟩ => ⟨a + b⟩

private irreducible_def neg : ℝ → ℝ
  | ⟨a⟩ => ⟨-a⟩

private irreducible_def mul : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
  | ⟨a⟩, ⟨b⟩ => ⟨a * b⟩

private noncomputable irreducible_def inv' : ℝ → ℝ
  | ⟨a⟩ => ⟨a⁻¹⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variante53feecdf4b3249750689ed3ebf9cce5121e390533fa8fc698ca47261d3b9b3f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variante53feecdf4b3249750689ed3ebf9cce5121e390533fa8fc698ca47261d3b9b3f.lean#L61).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d77b1f48397831306cfe743b29eef16889534918` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
