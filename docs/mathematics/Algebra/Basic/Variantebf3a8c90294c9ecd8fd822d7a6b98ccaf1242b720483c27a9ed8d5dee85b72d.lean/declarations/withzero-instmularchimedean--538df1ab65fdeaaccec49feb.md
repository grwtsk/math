## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:822d50910747b416f4b820b29a440eff6d3b39ed6a33a19c735edb69b4594ee3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 546–555.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance WithZero.instMulArchimedean (M) [CommMonoid M] [PartialOrder M] [MulArchimedean M] :
    MulArchimedean (WithZero M) := by
  constructor
  intro x y hxy
  cases y with
  | zero => exact absurd hxy (zero_le _).not_lt
  | coe y =>
    cases x with
    | zero => refine ⟨0, zero_le _⟩
    | coe x => simpa [← WithZero.coe_pow] using (MulArchimedean.arch x (by simpa using hxy))
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantebf3a8c90294c9ecd8fd822d7a6b98ccaf1242b720483c27a9ed8d5dee85b72d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantebf3a8c90294c9ecd8fd822d7a6b98ccaf1242b720483c27a9ed8d5dee85b72d.lean#L546).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `79cf73c914f625a55d598faf96e56ab883aec722` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
