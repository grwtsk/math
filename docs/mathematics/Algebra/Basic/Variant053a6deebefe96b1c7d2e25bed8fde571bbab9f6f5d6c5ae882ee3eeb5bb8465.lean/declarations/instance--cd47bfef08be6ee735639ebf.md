## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c990faf1cabeff4f453128df4ac0d5323916533a8083709e6574b752c576bdd8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–172.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (R S : Type*) [CommRing R] [CommRing S] [Algebra R S]
    [MulSemiringAction G S] [hGKL : IsGaloisGroup G R S] :
    IsGaloisGroup H (FixedPoints.subalgebra R S H) S where
  faithful := have := hGKL.faithful; inferInstance
  commutes := inferInstance
  isInvariant := ⟨fun x h ↦ ⟨⟨x, h⟩, rfl⟩⟩

section Quotient

section Semiring

variable (A B C : Type*) [CommSemiring A] [Semiring C] [Algebra A C] [MulSemiringAction G C]
variable (N : Subgroup G) [CommSemiring B] [Algebra B C]

/-- If `N` is a normal subgroup of `G` and `IsGaloisGroup N B C`, then `G` acts on `B`.
For `g : G` and `x : B`, `g • x` is the unique element of `B` whose image in `C` is
`g • algebraMap B C x`, see `algebraMap_smulOfNormal`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant053a6deebefe96b1c7d2e25bed8fde571bbab9f6f5d6c5ae882ee3eeb5bb8465.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant053a6deebefe96b1c7d2e25bed8fde571bbab9f6f5d6c5ae882ee3eeb5bb8465.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ece244dc0bc1498f09feac420f45299dfad1b540` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
