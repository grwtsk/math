## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a4bcc682c08b7ad9a7e47520f5719ef76d7c26cfa5e09c5965f2b5774f3c451c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 390–395.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance (priority := 100) perfectRing (p : ℕ) [Fact p.Prime] [CharP k p]
    [IsAlgClosed k] : PerfectRing k p :=
  PerfectRing.ofSurjective k p fun _ => IsAlgClosed.exists_pow_nat_eq _ <| NeZero.pos p
#align is_alg_closed.perfect_ring IsAlgClosed.perfectRing

/-- Algebraically closed fields are infinite since `Xⁿ⁺¹ - 1` is separable when `#K = n` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantceaea8f1ae7ee87b7559ffc0a5b5f85578c0f051fa50e4ea47df70a158e31f7a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantceaea8f1ae7ee87b7559ffc0a5b5f85578c0f051fa50e4ea47df70a158e31f7a.lean#L390).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d05c2dddcddcc926e98a56952b70c6dbbde87a61` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
