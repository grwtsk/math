## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a20b2673542baf1714a99eefdc6cdd9bed8a82bbd65ce28238d2e328268cc3ae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 260–274.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def isOne (cR : Common.Cache sR) {x : Q($A)} (zx : BaseType sAlg x) : Option Q(IsNat $x 1) :=
  let ⟨_, vx⟩ := zx
  match vx with
  | .add (.const c) .zero =>
    match (Ring.ringCompute cR).isOne c with
    | some pf => some q(isOne_algebraMap $pf)
    | none => none
  | .zero => none
  | _ => none

end RingCompute

open RingCompute in
/-- The data used by the `algebra` tactic to normalize the constant coefficients, which are
expressions in `R` normalized by `ring`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantf921be0d7249586683cf8a5478e9137911355ba8d41cfbaaf765ba3b077395fc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantf921be0d7249586683cf8a5478e9137911355ba8d41cfbaaf765ba3b077395fc.lean#L260).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ed995bfa0ffc702b8d0ec8411183ad7673672d08` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
