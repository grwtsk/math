## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9d646f6862a831af97ead05b053a03ab353f657ebf5f2beeebf64eaab0155104`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 397–444.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

      return q($pb ▸ $pa)

/-- `algebra` solves equalities in the language of algebras: ring operations and scalar
multiplications.

Given a goal which is an equality in a commutative `R`-algebra `A`, `algebra` parses the LHS and
RHS of the goal as polynomial expressions of `A`-atoms with coefficients in some semiring `R`, and
closes the goal if the two expressions are the same. The `R`-coefficients are put into ring normal
form.

By default, the scalar ring `R` is inferred automatically by looking for scalar multiplications and
`algebraMap`s present in the expressions. The inference procedure assumes that any two rings `R`
and `S` that appear are comparable, in the sense that either `R` is an `S`-algebra or `S` is an
`R`-algebra.

* `algebra with R` uses the term `R` as the scalar ring, instead of attempting to infer it
automatically.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantf921be0d7249586683cf8a5478e9137911355ba8d41cfbaaf765ba3b077395fc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantf921be0d7249586683cf8a5478e9137911355ba8d41cfbaaf765ba3b077395fc.lean#L397).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
