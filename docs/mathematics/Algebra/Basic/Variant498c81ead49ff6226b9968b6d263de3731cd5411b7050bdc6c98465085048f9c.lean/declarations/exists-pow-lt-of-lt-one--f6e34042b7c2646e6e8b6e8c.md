## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:10508694-8fd7-8ebe-31a6-5176df0e5a7d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 296–306.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_pow_lt_of_lt_one (hx : 0 < x) (hy : y < 1) : ∃ n : ℕ, y ^ n < x := by
  by_cases y_pos : y ≤ 0
  · use 1
    simp only [pow_one]
    exact y_pos.trans_lt hx
  rw [not_le] at y_pos
  rcases pow_unbounded_of_one_lt x⁻¹ ((one_lt_inv₀ y_pos).2 hy) with ⟨q, hq⟩
  exact ⟨q, by rwa [inv_pow, inv_lt_inv₀ hx (pow_pos y_pos _)] at hq⟩

/-- Given `x` and `y` between `0` and `1`, `x` is between two successive powers of `y`.
This is the same as `exists_nat_pow_near`, but for elements between `0` and `1` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant498c81ead49ff6226b9968b6d263de3731cd5411b7050bdc6c98465085048f9c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant498c81ead49ff6226b9968b6d263de3731cd5411b7050bdc6c98465085048f9c.lean#L296).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a2bec0e40694328e8405bc489abef27f6a24a1f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
