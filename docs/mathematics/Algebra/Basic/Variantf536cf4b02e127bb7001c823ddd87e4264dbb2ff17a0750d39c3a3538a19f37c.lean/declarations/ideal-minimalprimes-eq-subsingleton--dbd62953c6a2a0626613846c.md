## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4aef9d2a-bb51-f846-bb2c-407a3d462d23`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 142–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Ideal.minimalPrimes_eq_subsingleton (hI : I.IsPrimary) : I.minimalPrimes = {I.radical} := by
  ext J
  constructor
  · intro H
    have le := H.out.isPrime.radical_le_iff.mpr H.le
    exact (H.2 ⟨Ideal.isPrime_radical hI, Ideal.le_radical⟩ le).antisymm le
  · rintro (rfl : J = I.radical)
    exact ⟨⟨Ideal.isPrime_radical hI, Ideal.le_radical⟩, fun _ H _ => H.1.radical_le_iff.mpr H.2⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantf536cf4b02e127bb7001c823ddd87e4264dbb2ff17a0750d39c3a3538a19f37c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantf536cf4b02e127bb7001c823ddd87e4264dbb2ff17a0750d39c3a3538a19f37c.lean#L142).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `72fa8fd90d7ae8cb45adf472ec7995ed221ad16c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
