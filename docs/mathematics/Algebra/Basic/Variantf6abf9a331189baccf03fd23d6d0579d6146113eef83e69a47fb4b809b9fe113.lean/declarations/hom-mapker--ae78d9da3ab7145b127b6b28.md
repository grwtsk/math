## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ae569f9a7da0b1c8b7b094dd25bad4fabde9fe8f2bfcba8b96df2b3fc9d6423c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 277–287.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Hom.mapKer (f : P.Hom P')
    [alg : Algebra P.Ring P'.Ring] (halg : algebraMap P.Ring P'.Ring = f.toRingHom) :
    P.ker →ₗ[P.Ring] P'.ker where
  toFun x := ⟨f.toRingHom x, by simp [show algebraMap P.Ring S x = 0 from x.2]⟩
  map_add' _ _ := Subtype.ext (map_add _ _ _)
  map_smul' := by simp [Algebra.smul_def, ← halg]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantf6abf9a331189baccf03fd23d6d0579d6146113eef83e69a47fb4b809b9fe113.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantf6abf9a331189baccf03fd23d6d0579d6146113eef83e69a47fb4b809b9fe113.lean#L277).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a285c000db0d58feabbb54c8de8cc10d4ce129bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
