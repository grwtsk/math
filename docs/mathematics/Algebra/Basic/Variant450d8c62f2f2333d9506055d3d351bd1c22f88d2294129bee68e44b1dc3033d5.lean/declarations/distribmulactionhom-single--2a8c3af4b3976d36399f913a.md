## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:96b4d20ee20e184c731d8b3b61ea8cba3b47222ace086de69ba81fa3e7d74c0d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1179–1183.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def DistribMulActionHom.single [DistribMulAction R M] {α : Type*} (a : α) :
    M →+[R] SkewMonoidAlgebra M α where
  __ := singleAddHom a
  map_smul' k m := by simp [singleAddHom, smul_single, MonoidHom.id_apply]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant450d8c62f2f2333d9506055d3d351bd1c22f88d2294129bee68e44b1dc3033d5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant450d8c62f2f2333d9506055d3d351bd1c22f88d2294129bee68e44b1dc3033d5.lean#L1179).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `317900db788ea8d44ee009876588ce0b4d0a5759` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
