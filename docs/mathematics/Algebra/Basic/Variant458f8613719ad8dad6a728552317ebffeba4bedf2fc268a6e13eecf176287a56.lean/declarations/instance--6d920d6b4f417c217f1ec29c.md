## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6cf9a2d3c5e9a9d4ba9bcf62017e6913b9017bac925595aaeefea5ac61e8221e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 982–991.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (v : Valuation R Γ₀) : CommMonoidWithZero (MonoidHom.mrange v) where
  zero := ⟨0, 0, by simp⟩
  zero_mul := by
    intro a
    exact Subtype.ext (zero_mul a.val)
  mul_zero := by
    intro a
    exact Subtype.ext (mul_zero a.val)

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant458f8613719ad8dad6a728552317ebffeba4bedf2fc268a6e13eecf176287a56.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant458f8613719ad8dad6a728552317ebffeba4bedf2fc268a6e13eecf176287a56.lean#L982).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2ec2df2d98249cf416c09a55d151946533574627` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
