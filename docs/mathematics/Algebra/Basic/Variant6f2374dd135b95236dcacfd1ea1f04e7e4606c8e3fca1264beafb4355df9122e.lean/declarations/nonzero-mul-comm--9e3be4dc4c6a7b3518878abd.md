## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ce16ec41-e39a-19d9-35c1-a7464ece0e57`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 385–391.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nonzero_mul_comm (a b : A) : σ (a * b) \ {0} = σ (b * a) \ {0} := by
  suffices h : ∀ x y : A, σ (x * y) \ {0} ⊆ σ (y * x) \ {0} from
    Set.eq_of_subset_of_subset (h a b) (h b a)
  rintro _ _ k ⟨k_mem, k_neq⟩
  change ((Units.mk0 k k_neq) : 𝕜) ∈ _ at k_mem
  exact ⟨unit_mem_mul_comm.mp k_mem, k_neq⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant6f2374dd135b95236dcacfd1ea1f04e7e4606c8e3fca1264beafb4355df9122e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant6f2374dd135b95236dcacfd1ea1f04e7e4606c8e3fca1264beafb4355df9122e.lean#L385).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `224f704719226915ab23482aa01c3e65c11f16af` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
