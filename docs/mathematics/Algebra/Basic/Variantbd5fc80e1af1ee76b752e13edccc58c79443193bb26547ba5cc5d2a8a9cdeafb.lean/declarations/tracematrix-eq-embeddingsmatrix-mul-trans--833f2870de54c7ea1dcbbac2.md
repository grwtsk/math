## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:48bef00b-6101-456a-f05b-641664442349`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 452–455.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem traceMatrix_eq_embeddingsMatrix_mul_trans : (traceMatrix K b).map (algebraMap K E) =
    embeddingsMatrix K E b * (embeddingsMatrix K E b)ᵀ := by
  ext (i j); simp [trace_eq_sum_embeddings, embeddingsMatrix, Matrix.mul_apply]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantbd5fc80e1af1ee76b752e13edccc58c79443193bb26547ba5cc5d2a8a9cdeafb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantbd5fc80e1af1ee76b752e13edccc58c79443193bb26547ba5cc5d2a8a9cdeafb.lean#L452).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `01097c8fe6fc42f93d70fa0be5fa76cda768b701` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
