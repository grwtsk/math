## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a17fe5be-09d7-3896-7781-26ba84cc22b8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 196–209.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem natCast_add {a₁ a₂ : ℕ}
    (_ : ((a₁ : ℕ) : R) = b₁) (_ : ((a₂ : ℕ) : R) = b₂) : ((a₁ + a₂ : ℕ) : R) = b₁ + b₂ := by

mutual -- partial only to speed up compilation

variable {v : Lean.Level} {β : Q(Type v)} (sβ : Q(CommSemiring $β))
  (_ : v =QL 0) (_ : $β =Q ℕ) (_ : $sβ =Q inferInstance)

/-- Applies `Nat.cast` to a nat polynomial to produce a polynomial in `α`.

* An atom `e` causes `↑e` to be allocated as a new atom.
* A sum delegates to `ExSum.evalNatCast`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantecb0f4f30792359900bc38a151f86a56f14cbcd2bc49f9a09bf3954ac25eda4c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantecb0f4f30792359900bc38a151f86a56f14cbcd2bc49f9a09bf3954ac25eda4c.lean#L196).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f4e11fa8d49fd9de908d845bdffc55407fc5c49` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
