## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5e4c58898d6b29cf1ae6b9276375bea438929f2842cc1c99af45e76654853d72`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 256–260.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toInfinitesimal (P : Extension R S) : P.Hom P.infinitesimal where
  toRingHom := Ideal.Quotient.mk _
  toRingHom_algebraMap _ := rfl
  algebraMap_toRingHom _ := rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Varianteb1d3f51c02c15338d8646bd09989cabb976d422bc65800856fa507b2ff06ce7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Varianteb1d3f51c02c15338d8646bd09989cabb976d422bc65800856fa507b2ff06ce7.lean#L256).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `577fe06140e45bce34c448e91329dc1bc732d032` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
