## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b7e459a7-260b-3f43-6882-2f78ad63d9d9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 282–291.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem not_isField_iff_exists_prime [Nontrivial R] :
    ¬IsField R ↔ ∃ p : Ideal R, p ≠ ⊥ ∧ p.IsPrime := by
  refine ⟨fun h ↦ ?_, fun ⟨I, h_bot, h_top⟩ ↦ not_isField_of_ne_of_ne h_bot h_top.ne_top⟩
  obtain ⟨I, hI, hIm⟩ := exists_maximal_of_not_isField h
  exact ⟨I, hI, hIm.isPrime⟩

/-- Also see `Ideal.isSimpleOrder` for the forward direction as an instance when `R` is a
division (semi)ring.

This result actually holds for all division semirings, but we lack the predicate to state it. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant08733a4937f53162065b8b461e9ee3b7a26decfd1ce80a190277ad53d78b883c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant08733a4937f53162065b8b461e9ee3b7a26decfd1ce80a190277ad53d78b883c.lean#L282).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9840c8b8077c6c43ca193f61612630a09a3638cf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
