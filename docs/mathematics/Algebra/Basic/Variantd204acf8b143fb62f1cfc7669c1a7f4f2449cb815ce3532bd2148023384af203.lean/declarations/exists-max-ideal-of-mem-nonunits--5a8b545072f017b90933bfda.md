## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d1086b7e-2eba-8955-ba15-9b3d36de851d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 860–871.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_max_ideal_of_mem_nonunits [CommSemiring α] (h : a ∈ nonunits α) :
    ∃ I : Ideal α, I.IsMaximal ∧ a ∈ I := by
  have : Ideal.span ({a} : Set α) ≠ ⊤ := by
    intro H
    rw [Ideal.span_singleton_eq_top] at H
    contradiction
  rcases Ideal.exists_le_maximal _ this with ⟨I, Imax, H⟩
  use I, Imax
  apply H
  apply Ideal.subset_span
  exact Set.mem_singleton a
#align exists_max_ideal_of_mem_nonunits exists_max_ideal_of_mem_nonunits
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantd204acf8b143fb62f1cfc7669c1a7f4f2449cb815ce3532bd2148023384af203.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantd204acf8b143fb62f1cfc7669c1a7f4f2449cb815ce3532bd2148023384af203.lean#L860).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b6d8f26b55eff3b9ac078e04077949c955e32c75` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
