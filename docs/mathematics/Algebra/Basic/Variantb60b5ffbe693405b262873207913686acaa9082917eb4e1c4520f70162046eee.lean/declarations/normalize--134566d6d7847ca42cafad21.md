## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d5d32be32273e7fef271c5aafc468bb3b558e9ee2c63d819cf501244eea85bde`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 91–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def normalize : α →*₀ α where
  toFun x := x * normUnit x
  map_zero' := by
    simp only [normUnit_zero]
    exact mul_one (0 : α)
  map_one' := by rw [normUnit_one, one_mul]; rfl
  map_mul' x y :=
    (by_cases fun hx : x = 0 => by rw [hx, zero_mul, zero_mul, zero_mul]) fun hx =>
      (by_cases fun hy : y = 0 => by rw [hy, mul_zero, zero_mul, mul_zero]) fun hy => by
        simp only [normUnit_mul hx hy, Units.val_mul]; simp only [mul_assoc, mul_left_comm y]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantb60b5ffbe693405b262873207913686acaa9082917eb4e1c4520f70162046eee.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantb60b5ffbe693405b262873207913686acaa9082917eb4e1c4520f70162046eee.lean#L91).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3daa51f65ae1319070081f4f08951c1a64981bee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
