## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0389f13f-0df8-88fb-d84f-f7b8d8326b04`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 369–374.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sqLe_add {c d x y z w : ℕ} (xy : SqLe x c y d) (zw : SqLe z c w d) :
    SqLe (x + z) c (y + w) d := by
  have xz := sqLe_add_mixed xy zw
  simp? [SqLe, mul_assoc] at xy zw says simp only [SqLe, mul_assoc] at xy zw
  simp [SqLe, mul_add, mul_comm, mul_left_comm, add_le_add, *]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant7d5317dca832e8f363a9181536e5d5dd39e195f8368942d3a783e1bff3120dc5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant7d5317dca832e8f363a9181536e5d5dd39e195f8368942d3a783e1bff3120dc5.lean#L369).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9e8bf4b990d1e77a70f9979aea571a50f56545e5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
