## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ee04d055-b027-b649-0632-8d12c8c5191f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–219.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem AlgHom.restrict_liftNormal (ϕ : K₁ →ₐ[F] K₁) [Normal F K₁] [Normal F E] :
    (ϕ.liftNormal E).restrictNormal K₁ = ϕ :=
  AlgHom.ext fun x =>
    (algebraMap K₁ E).injective
      (Eq.trans (AlgHom.restrictNormal_commutes _ K₁ x) (ϕ.liftNormal_commutes E x))

/-- If `E/Kᵢ/F` are towers of fields with `E/F` normal then we can lift
  an algebra isomorphism `ϕ : K₁ ≃ₐ[F] K₂` to `ϕ.liftNormal E : E ≃ₐ[F] E`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant9f0d4c6c09a4a21d154e9574b56b85e6b5816b22cbab84e27b545570f2657c81.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant9f0d4c6c09a4a21d154e9574b56b85e6b5816b22cbab84e27b545570f2657c81.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0fe875fca7bc93d00c101231a39ddc8f306e9041` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
