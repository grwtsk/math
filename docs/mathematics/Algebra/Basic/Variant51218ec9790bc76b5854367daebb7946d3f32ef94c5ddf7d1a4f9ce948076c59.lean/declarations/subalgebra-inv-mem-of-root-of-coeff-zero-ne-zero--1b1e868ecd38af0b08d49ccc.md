## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a47f5b32-97a0-6809-7716-b83705b536c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 687–695.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Subalgebra.inv_mem_of_root_of_coeff_zero_ne_zero {x : A} {p : K[X]}
    (aeval_eq : aeval x p = 0) (coeff_zero_ne : p.coeff 0 ≠ 0) : (x⁻¹ : L) ∈ A := by
  suffices (x⁻¹ : L) = (-p.coeff 0)⁻¹ • aeval x (divX p) by
    rw [this]
    exact A.smul_mem (aeval x _).2 _
  have : aeval (x : L) p = 0 := by rw [Subalgebra.aeval_coe, aeval_eq, Subalgebra.coe_zero]
  rw [inv_eq_of_root_of_coeff_zero_ne_zero this coeff_zero_ne, div_eq_inv_mul, Algebra.smul_def,
    aeval_coe, map_inv₀, map_neg, inv_neg, neg_mul]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant51218ec9790bc76b5854367daebb7946d3f32ef94c5ddf7d1a4f9ce948076c59.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant51218ec9790bc76b5854367daebb7946d3f32ef94c5ddf7d1a4f9ce948076c59.lean#L687).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `73b7d5a96117be596f110dbb2bec3f5ebca97c98` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
