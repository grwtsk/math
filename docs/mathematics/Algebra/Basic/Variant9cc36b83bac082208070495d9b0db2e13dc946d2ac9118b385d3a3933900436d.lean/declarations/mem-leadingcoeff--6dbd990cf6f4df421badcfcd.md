## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:622af1b2-cfd6-ea41-a58c-f59b067ad8e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 607–623.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

#align ideal.mem_leading_coeff Ideal.mem_leadingCoeff

/-- If `I` is an ideal, and `pᵢ` is a finite family of polynomials each satisfying
`∀ k, (pᵢ)ₖ ∈ Iⁿⁱ⁻ᵏ` for some `nᵢ`, then `p = ∏ pᵢ` also satisfies `∀ k, pₖ ∈ Iⁿ⁻ᵏ` with `n = ∑ nᵢ`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant9cc36b83bac082208070495d9b0db2e13dc946d2ac9118b385d3a3933900436d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant9cc36b83bac082208070495d9b0db2e13dc946d2ac9118b385d3a3933900436d.lean#L607).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c29e1314ab11ac4476d2cf5e3a25b5f3b8ac0289` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
