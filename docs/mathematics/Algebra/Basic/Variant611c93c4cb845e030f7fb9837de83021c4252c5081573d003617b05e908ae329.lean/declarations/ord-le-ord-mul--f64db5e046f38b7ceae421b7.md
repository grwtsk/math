## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:df4dfa1b-64ec-c4ca-a3b5-200789c298fe`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 189–196.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma ord_le_ord_mul (a : R) (x : R) : ord R x ≤ ord R (a * x) := by
  simp only [ord]
  suffices Ideal.span {a * x} ≤ Ideal.span {x} by
    let g : (R ⧸ Ideal.span {a * x}) →ₗ[R] (R ⧸ Ideal.span {x}) := Submodule.factor this
    refine Module.length_le_of_surjective (Submodule.factor this) (Submodule.factor_surjective this)
  rw [Ideal.span_singleton_le_span_singleton]
  exact Dvd.intro_left (algebraMap R R a) rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant611c93c4cb845e030f7fb9837de83021c4252c5081573d003617b05e908ae329.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant611c93c4cb845e030f7fb9837de83021c4252c5081573d003617b05e908ae329.lean#L189).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ec6bc9b0fb7ccfc7c048d6fa7f7260d8164a7559` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
