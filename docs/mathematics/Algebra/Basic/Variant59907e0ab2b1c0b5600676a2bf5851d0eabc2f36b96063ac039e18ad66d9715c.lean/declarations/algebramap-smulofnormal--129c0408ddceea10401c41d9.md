## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:01113f7e-0c90-f8cf-c779-45de8e826dcf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 185–191.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem algebraMap_smulOfNormal [N.Normal] [IsGaloisGroup N B C] (g : G) (x : B) :
    letI := smulOfNormal G B C
    algebraMap B C (g • x) = g • algebraMap B C x :=
  (smul_mem_of_normal G C N g x).choose_spec

/-- If `N` is normal and `IsGaloisGroup N B C`, the action `smulOfNormal G B C` satisfies
`SMulDistribClass G B C`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant59907e0ab2b1c0b5600676a2bf5851d0eabc2f36b96063ac039e18ad66d9715c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant59907e0ab2b1c0b5600676a2bf5851d0eabc2f36b96063ac039e18ad66d9715c.lean#L185).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee4860c65d0d61ca8e3eb05104e2fc573c3af3b8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
