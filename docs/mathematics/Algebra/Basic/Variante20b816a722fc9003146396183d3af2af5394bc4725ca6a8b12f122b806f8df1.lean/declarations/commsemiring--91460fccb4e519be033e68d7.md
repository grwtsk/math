## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f8c69c6db8f7ab5bffa969def67d599e839bc7eb3d92613447d4a23b5bbaf9ff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 130–139.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class CommSemiring (α : Type u) extends Semiring α where
  /-- Multiplication is commutative. -/
  mul_comm : ∀ a b : α, a * b = b * a
  one_mul := by intro a; rw [mul_comm, mul_one]
  mul_zero := by intro a; rw [mul_comm, zero_mul]
  right_distrib := by intro a b c; rw [mul_comm, left_distrib, mul_comm c, mul_comm c]

/--
A commutative ring, i.e. a ring with commutative multiplication.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variante20b816a722fc9003146396183d3af2af5394bc4725ca6a8b12f122b806f8df1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variante20b816a722fc9003146396183d3af2af5394bc4725ca6a8b12f122b806f8df1.lean#L130).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `df06ba54411c49d84f6ced50cd807d2544716fe9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
