## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8cf892e0-c120-45eb-9487-fa9b7380f150`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 887–901.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem gcd_eq_of_dvd_sub_right {a b c : α} (h : a ∣ b - c) : gcd a b = gcd a c := by
  apply dvd_antisymm_of_normalize_eq (normalize_gcd _ _) (normalize_gcd _ _) <;>
    rw [dvd_gcd_iff] <;>
    refine ⟨gcd_dvd_left _ _, ?_⟩
  · rcases h with ⟨d, hd⟩
    rcases gcd_dvd_right a b with ⟨e, he⟩
    rcases gcd_dvd_left a b with ⟨f, hf⟩
    use e - f * d
    rw [mul_sub, ← he, ← mul_assoc, ← hf, ← hd, sub_sub_cancel]
  · rcases h with ⟨d, hd⟩
    rcases gcd_dvd_right a c with ⟨e, he⟩
    rcases gcd_dvd_left a c with ⟨f, hf⟩
    use e + f * d
    rw [mul_add, ← he, ← mul_assoc, ← hf, ← hd, ← add_sub_assoc, add_comm c b, add_sub_cancel_right]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant7b73e08586066af0e75003ae12a781d19ce90ea4e2d084420b717994d40f363e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant7b73e08586066af0e75003ae12a781d19ce90ea4e2d084420b717994d40f363e.lean#L887).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5bd393597fdb26b189614093565aba54ead9d1d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
