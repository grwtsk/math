## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bb1e53ba1ad83458900544862d3850f0fd488b54d61bac79397e0e4e3a9398b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def RingHom.LocalizationPreserves :=
  ∀ ⦃R S : Type u⦄ [CommRing R] [CommRing S] (f : R →+* S) (M : Submonoid R) (R' S' : Type u)
    [CommRing R'] [CommRing S'] [Algebra R R'] [Algebra S S'] [IsLocalization M R']
    [IsLocalization (M.map f) S'],
    P f → P (IsLocalization.map S' f (Submonoid.le_comap_map M) : R' →+* S')

/-- A property `P` of ring homs is said to be preserved by localization away
if `P` holds for `Rᵣ →+* Sᵣ` whenever `P` holds for `R →+* S`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant4bd2f0ba188dedcd807dfe641c70afaab5c7d7e837f4250810f7e65892f2b2b1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant4bd2f0ba188dedcd807dfe641c70afaab5c7d7e837f4250810f7e65892f2b2b1.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c4843966cdd144391aab8bcdbab8b77677ad3ec9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
