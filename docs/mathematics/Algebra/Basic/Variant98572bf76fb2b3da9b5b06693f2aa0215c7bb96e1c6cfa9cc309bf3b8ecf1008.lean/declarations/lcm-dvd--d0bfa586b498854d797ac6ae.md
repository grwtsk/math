## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9276b976-19dc-d5ae-e584-be4305f04c3a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 259–283.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lcm_dvd {x y z : R} (hxz : x ∣ z) (hyz : y ∣ z) : lcm x y ∣ z := by
  rw [lcm]
  by_cases hxy : gcd x y = 0
  · rw [hxy, div_zero]
    rw [EuclideanDomain.gcd_eq_zero_iff] at hxy
    rwa [hxy.1] at hxz
  rcases gcd_dvd x y with ⟨⟨r, hr⟩, ⟨s, hs⟩⟩
  suffices x * y ∣ z * gcd x y by
    obtain ⟨p, hp⟩ := this
    use p
    generalize gcd x y = g at hxy hs hp ⊢
    subst hs
    rw [mul_left_comm, mul_div_cancel_left₀ _ hxy, ← mul_left_inj' hxy, hp]
    rw [← mul_assoc]
    simp only [mul_right_comm]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant98572bf76fb2b3da9b5b06693f2aa0215c7bb96e1c6cfa9cc309bf3b8ecf1008.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant98572bf76fb2b3da9b5b06693f2aa0215c7bb96e1c6cfa9cc309bf3b8ecf1008.lean#L259).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `97d61caa997e3ccd59facebbf086d592a268dbe4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
