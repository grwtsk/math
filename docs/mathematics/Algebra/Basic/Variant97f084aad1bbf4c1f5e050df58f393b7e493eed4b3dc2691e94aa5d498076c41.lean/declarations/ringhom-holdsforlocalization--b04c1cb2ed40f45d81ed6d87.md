## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0305a2d00cd028290c682999f25bcf5ed18f75cf1ea1ae6ccca801b2b97622c5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 123–128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def RingHom.HoldsForLocalization : Prop :=
  ∀ ⦃R : Type u⦄ (S : Type u) [CommRing R] [CommRing S] [Algebra R S] (M : Submonoid R)
    [IsLocalization M S], P (algebraMap R S)

/-- A property `P` of ring homs satisfies `RingHom.HoldsForLocalizationAway`
if `P` holds for each localization map `R →+* Rᵣ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant97f084aad1bbf4c1f5e050df58f393b7e493eed4b3dc2691e94aa5d498076c41.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant97f084aad1bbf4c1f5e050df58f393b7e493eed4b3dc2691e94aa5d498076c41.lean#L123).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `af76a457e6a18ad78b34dcd5faa806a720ada910` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
