## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7a971e223d7ed6b15049640bdb522f6aaf22cc5d908f416f089a96222c254885`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 71–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def OfLocalizationMaximal : Prop :=
  ∀ (R : Type u) [CommRing R],
    (∀ (J : Ideal R) (_ : J.IsMaximal), P (Localization.AtPrime J)) → P R

end CommRing

section RingHom

variable (P : ∀ {R S : Type u} [CommRing R] [CommRing S] (_ : R →+* S), Prop)

/-- A property `P` of ring homs is said to contain identities if `P` holds
for the identity homomorphism of every ring. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant97f084aad1bbf4c1f5e050df58f393b7e493eed4b3dc2691e94aa5d498076c41.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant97f084aad1bbf4c1f5e050df58f393b7e493eed4b3dc2691e94aa5d498076c41.lean#L71).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `af76a457e6a18ad78b34dcd5faa806a720ada910` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
