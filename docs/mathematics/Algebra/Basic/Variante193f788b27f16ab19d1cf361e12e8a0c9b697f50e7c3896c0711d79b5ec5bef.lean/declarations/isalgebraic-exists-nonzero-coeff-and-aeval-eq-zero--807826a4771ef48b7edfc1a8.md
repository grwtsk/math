## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ae82771f-c0e9-8cbf-7597-6543b48455ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 545–553.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsAlgebraic.exists_nonzero_coeff_and_aeval_eq_zero
    {s : S} (hRs : IsAlgebraic R s) (hs : s ∈ nonZeroDivisors S) :
    ∃ q : R[X], q.coeff 0 ≠ 0 ∧ aeval s q = 0 := by
  obtain ⟨p, hp0, hp⟩ := hRs
  obtain ⟨q, hpq, hq⟩ := exists_eq_pow_rootMultiplicity_mul_and_not_dvd p hp0 0
  simp only [C_0, sub_zero, X_pow_mul, X_dvd_iff] at hpq hq
  rw [hpq, map_mul, aeval_X_pow] at hp
  exact ⟨q, hq, (nonZeroDivisors S).pow_mem hs (rootMultiplicity 0 p) (aeval s q) hp⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variante193f788b27f16ab19d1cf361e12e8a0c9b697f50e7c3896c0711d79b5ec5bef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variante193f788b27f16ab19d1cf361e12e8a0c9b697f50e7c3896c0711d79b5ec5bef.lean#L545).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `965e9965ffaf7a90d74c43cbb8b7f0999ebf51ee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
