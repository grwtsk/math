## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6e355541-96ec-00c6-6f52-ec89a0e87ae6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 352–358.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_div_mul_cancel {a b c : R} (ha : a ≠ 0) (hcb : c ∣ b) : a * b / (a * c) = b / c := by
  by_cases hc : c = 0; · simp [hc]
  refine' eq_div_of_mul_eq_right hc (mul_left_cancel₀ ha _)
  rw [← mul_assoc, ← mul_div_assoc _ (mul_dvd_mul_left a hcb),
    mul_div_cancel_left _ (mul_ne_zero ha hc)]
#align euclidean_domain.mul_div_mul_cancel EuclideanDomain.mul_div_mul_cancel

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantb1b58abb8a10186f5052f43ffafbac6aec14134bff9dddae00cfb46b6350fad9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantb1b58abb8a10186f5052f43ffafbac6aec14134bff9dddae00cfb46b6350fad9.lean#L352).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `625b3283e6ecd7c3ee3acda4bc3acc51f895f4d7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
