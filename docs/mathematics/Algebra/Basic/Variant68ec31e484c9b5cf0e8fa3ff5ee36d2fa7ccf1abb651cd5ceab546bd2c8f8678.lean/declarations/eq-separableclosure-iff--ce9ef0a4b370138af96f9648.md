## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ddac98b9-2c91-0467-71c1-2222aa4b3a0e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 537–545.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_separableClosure_iff [Algebra.IsAlgebraic F E] (L : IntermediateField F E) :
    L = separableClosure F E ↔ Algebra.IsSeparable F L ∧ IsPurelyInseparable L E :=
  ⟨by rintro rfl; exact ⟨isSeparable F E, isPurelyInseparable F E⟩,
   fun ⟨_, _⟩ ↦ eq_separableClosure F E L⟩

/-- If `L` is an algebraically closed field containing `E`, such that the map
`(E →+* L) → (F →+* L)` induced by `algebraMap F E` is injective, then `E / F` is
purely inseparable. As a corollary, epimorphisms in the category of fields must be
purely inseparable extensions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant68ec31e484c9b5cf0e8fa3ff5ee36d2fa7ccf1abb651cd5ceab546bd2c8f8678.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant68ec31e484c9b5cf0e8fa3ff5ee36d2fa7ccf1abb651cd5ceab546bd2c8f8678.lean#L537).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `527923b4d89f8f1508cf07b72b52e1020363cec2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
