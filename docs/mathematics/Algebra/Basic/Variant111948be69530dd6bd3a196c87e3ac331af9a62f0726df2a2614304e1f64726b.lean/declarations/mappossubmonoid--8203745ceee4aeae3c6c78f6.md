## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8269b7a4a3a9318898e54d2c4c578e4dd53c7cb73db6596d26427a1b0259084d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1265–1278.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mapPosSubmonoid : posSubmonoid A →* posSubmonoid B where
  toFun := fun ⟨a,ha⟩ => ⟨algebraMap _ _ a,
    by simpa only [posSubmonoid_def, ← (algebraMap A B).map_zero, vlt_iff_vlt] using ha⟩
  map_one' := by simp
  map_mul' := by simp

variable (A) in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant111948be69530dd6bd3a196c87e3ac331af9a62f0726df2a2614304e1f64726b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant111948be69530dd6bd3a196c87e3ac331af9a62f0726df2a2614304e1f64726b.lean#L1265).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `63286af4d73cda50f05afa350b3364de2aa7f3c0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
