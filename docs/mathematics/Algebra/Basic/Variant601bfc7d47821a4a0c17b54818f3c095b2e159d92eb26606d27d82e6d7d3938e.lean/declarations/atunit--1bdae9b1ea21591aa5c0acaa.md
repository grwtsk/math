## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4278a9118ae26020b0b601f84ed8e68ddb2dcf99b21c6884d7272eef208eeaaf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 145–154.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def atUnit (x : R) (e : IsUnit x) [IsLocalization.Away x S] : R ≃ₐ[R] S := by
  apply atUnits R (Submonoid.powers x)
  rintro ⟨xn, n, hxn⟩
  obtain ⟨u, hu⟩ := e
  rw [isUnit_iff_exists_inv]
  use u.inv ^ n
  simp [← hxn, ← hu, ← mul_pow]
#align is_localization.at_unit IsLocalization.atUnit

/-- The localization at one is isomorphic to the ring. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant601bfc7d47821a4a0c17b54818f3c095b2e159d92eb26606d27d82e6d7d3938e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant601bfc7d47821a4a0c17b54818f3c095b2e159d92eb26606d27d82e6d7d3938e.lean#L145).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `66683c752a5edd4c5cff7b6f68e9177cb134dd64` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
