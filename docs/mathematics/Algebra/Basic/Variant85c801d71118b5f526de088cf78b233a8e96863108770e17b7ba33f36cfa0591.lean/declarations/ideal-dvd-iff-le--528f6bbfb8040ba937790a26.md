## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ec7667cf-47ed-8c4a-7ed6-5407c2b9272d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 403–415.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Ideal.dvd_iff_le {I J : Ideal A} : I ∣ J ↔ J ≤ I :=
  ⟨Ideal.le_of_dvd, fun h => by
    by_cases hI : I = ⊥
    · have hJ : J = ⊥ := by rwa [hI, ← eq_bot_iff] at h
      rw [hI, hJ]
    have hI' : (I : FractionalIdeal A⁰ (FractionRing A)) ≠ 0 := coeIdeal_ne_zero.mpr hI
    have : (I : FractionalIdeal A⁰ (FractionRing A))⁻¹ * J ≤ 1 := by
      rw [← inv_mul_cancel₀ hI']; gcongr
    obtain ⟨H, hH⟩ := le_one_iff_exists_coeIdeal.mp this
    use H
    refine coeIdeal_injective (show (J : FractionalIdeal A⁰ (FractionRing A)) = ↑(I * H) from ?_)
    rw [coeIdeal_mul, hH, ← mul_assoc, mul_inv_cancel₀ hI', one_mul]⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant85c801d71118b5f526de088cf78b233a8e96863108770e17b7ba33f36cfa0591.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant85c801d71118b5f526de088cf78b233a8e96863108770e17b7ba33f36cfa0591.lean#L403).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b9bb261d4d9848f5d4595f49209e2f99a081a901` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
