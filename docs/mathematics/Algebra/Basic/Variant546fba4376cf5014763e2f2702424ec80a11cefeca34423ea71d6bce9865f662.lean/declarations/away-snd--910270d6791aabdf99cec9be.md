## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1ae2d9fed55014cfbd977017f30ca982fd113cdb78163a78a7edb193389b7988`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 428–445.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance away_snd {R S} [CommSemiring R] [CommSemiring S] :

    IsLocalization.Away (R := R × S) (0, 1) S :=
  letI := (RingHom.snd R S).toAlgebra
  away_of_isIdempotentElem_of_mul (by ext <;> simp)
    (fun ⟨xR, xS⟩ ⟨yR, yS⟩ ↦ show xS = yS ↔ _ by simp) Prod.snd_surjective

open scoped Pointwise in
/-- Suppose `I` is an ideal of `R`, then `R / I` is the localization away from `r : R`
if `r - 1 ∈ I` and for some `n`, `r ^ n • I = ⊥`.
For sake of usability, we state this for surjective ring maps instead of ideals.
For a version with two ideals, see `Away.of_sub_one_mem_ker'`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant546fba4376cf5014763e2f2702424ec80a11cefeca34423ea71d6bce9865f662.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant546fba4376cf5014763e2f2702424ec80a11cefeca34423ea71d6bce9865f662.lean#L428).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8bed43f5f6144ba0ab91e399cabe5050d7f4fb05` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
