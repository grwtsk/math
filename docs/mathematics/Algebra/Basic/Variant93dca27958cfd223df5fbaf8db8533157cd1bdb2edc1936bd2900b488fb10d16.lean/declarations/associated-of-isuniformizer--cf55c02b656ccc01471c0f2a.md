## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8fee92b6-2925-bc15-cc25-bbbd5fd05372`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 336–344.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem associated_of_isUniformizer {π₁ π₂ : K₀} (h1 : IsUniformizer v π₁)
    (h2 : IsUniformizer v π₂) : Associated π₁ π₂ := by
  have hval : v ((π₁ : K)⁻¹ * π₂) = 1 := by
    simp [IsUniformizer.iff.mp h1, IsUniformizer.iff.mp h2]
  set p : v.integer := ⟨(π₁.1 : K)⁻¹ * π₂.1, (v.mem_integer_iff _).mpr (le_of_eq hval)⟩ with hp
  use ((Integers.isUnit_iff_valuation_eq_one (x := p) <| integer.integers v).mpr hval).unit
  apply_fun ((↑) : K₀ → K) using Subtype.val_injective
  simp [hp, ← mul_assoc, mul_inv_cancel₀ h1.ne_zero]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant93dca27958cfd223df5fbaf8db8533157cd1bdb2edc1936bd2900b488fb10d16.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant93dca27958cfd223df5fbaf8db8533157cd1bdb2edc1936bd2900b488fb10d16.lean#L336).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `60fa34ccd11e1cebdab4022a4370d80cb18f807b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
