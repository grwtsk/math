## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d81530a4c9682137b6687b6b1ed55343d129088829715ada52c6b6c878f3554b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 372–388.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def inferBase (ca : Cache q($sA)) (e : Expr) : MetaM <| Σ u : Lean.Level, Q(Type u) := do
  let rings ← (← collectScalarRings e).mapM getLevelQ'
  let res ← match rings with
  | [] =>
    match ca.field, ca.czα, ca.rα with
    | some _, some _, _ =>
      -- A is a Field
      return ⟨0, q(ℚ)⟩
    | _, _, some _ =>
      -- A is a CommRing
      return ⟨0, q(ℤ)⟩
    | _, _, _ =>
      return ⟨0, q(ℕ)⟩
  | r :: rs => rs.foldlM pickLargerRing r
  return res

/-- Frontend of `algebra`: attempt to close a goal `g`, assuming it is an equation of semirings. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variante94c4e3a197cad1c7dfb8e96cb9b3fde7d02f29e6ec1e2858cf63689a08cd4e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variante94c4e3a197cad1c7dfb8e96cb9b3fde7d02f29e6ec1e2858cf63689a08cd4e7.lean#L372).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0dd5953d2e8bcc041f12f7ff84281f2cc2c73b23` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
