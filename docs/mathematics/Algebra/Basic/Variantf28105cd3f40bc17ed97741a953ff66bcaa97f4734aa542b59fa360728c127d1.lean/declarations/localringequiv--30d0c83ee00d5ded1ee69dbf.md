## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2240443db26df911795833296b7f2b3c37618fe0b4f2b5344e3c7af9070c208d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 291–303.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def localRingEquiv (J : Ideal P) [J.IsPrime] (f : R ≃+* P) (hIJ : I = J.comap f) :
    Localization.AtPrime I ≃+* Localization.AtPrime J where
  __ := localRingHom I J f hIJ
  invFun := localRingHom J I f.symm
    (by rw [hIJ, ← Ideal.comap_coe f, Ideal.comap_comap, RingEquiv.comp_symm, Ideal.comap_id])
  left_inv x := by simp [localRingHom, map_map]
  right_inv x := by simp [localRingHom, map_map]

variable {S} in
/-- For an `R`-algebra homomorphism `f : S →ₐ[R] P` and prime ideals `I = f⁻¹(J)`, the induced
`R`-algebra homomorphism from the localization of `S` at `I` to the localization of `P` at `J`.

See `localAlgHom'` for a variant where the base ring `R` is also localized. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantf28105cd3f40bc17ed97741a953ff66bcaa97f4734aa542b59fa360728c127d1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantf28105cd3f40bc17ed97741a953ff66bcaa97f4734aa542b59fa360728c127d1.lean#L291).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7eebc43c1d7f01f6484aae60c4c7433c8b48c39a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
