## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:128be16c-fef5-d39f-5b3e-545b81d777c7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 514–526.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma drop_sum_flatten (L : List (List α)) (i : ℕ) :
    L.flatten.drop ((L.map length).take i).sum = (L.drop i).flatten := by
  induction L generalizing i
  · simp
  · cases i <;> simp [*]

end List


namespace List

/-- If all elements in a list are bounded below by `1`, then the length of the list is bounded
by the sum of the elements. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant9bee12a23641513416ee3d3ed463af60f6208e0ae7504730565f8ecabea0a72e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant9bee12a23641513416ee3d3ed463af60f6208e0ae7504730565f8ecabea0a72e.lean#L514).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c26f2ab61946301b30b827c7976e04f1011b12ae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
