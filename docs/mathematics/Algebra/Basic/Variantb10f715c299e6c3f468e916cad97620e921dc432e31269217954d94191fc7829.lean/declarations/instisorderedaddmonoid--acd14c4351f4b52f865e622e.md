## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:77ccaf3d3a67ace4525cf36801b69d3c01dc325fa6481f07a17ade5c84d91ef8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 346–358.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instIsOrderedAddMonoid : IsOrderedAddMonoid ℝ where
  add_le_add_left := by
    simp only [le_iff_eq_or_lt]
    rintro a b ⟨rfl, h⟩
    · simp only [lt_self_iff_false, or_false, forall_const]
    · refine fun c => Or.inr ?_
      induction a using Real.ind_mk with | _ a =>
      induction b using Real.ind_mk with | _ b =>
      induction c using Real.ind_mk with | _ c =>
      simp only [mk_lt, ← mk_add] at *
      change Pos _ at *
      rwa [add_sub_add_right_eq_sub]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variantb10f715c299e6c3f468e916cad97620e921dc432e31269217954d94191fc7829.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variantb10f715c299e6c3f468e916cad97620e921dc432e31269217954d94191fc7829.lean#L346).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f5de911ff81bf5a8a6dc2e3dbfe8a4a7beec8f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
