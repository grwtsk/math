## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3f3afd720b8a19bb7f6d7ef29c7f20df60a04518ba5de0c07edc2e9307f4f298`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 135–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance MulOpposite.instHasDistribNeg : HasDistribNeg αᵐᵒᵖ where
  neg_mul _ _ := unop_injective <| mul_neg _ _
  mul_neg _ _ := unop_injective <| neg_mul _ _

end Mul

end HasDistribNeg

section NonUnitalCommRing

variable {α : Type*} [NonUnitalCommRing α]

attribute [local simp] add_assoc add_comm add_left_comm mul_comm

/-- Vieta's formula for a quadratic equation, relating the coefficients of the polynomial with
  its roots. This particular version states that if we have a root `x` of a monic quadratic
  polynomial, then there is another root `y` such that `x + y` is negative the `a_1` coefficient
  and `x * y` is the `a_0` coefficient. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Basic/Variant5ff332ec2eadf105ea5db5449f96c241510b0e59bc9c5ef1a7467dc860f01025.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Basic/Variant5ff332ec2eadf105ea5db5449f96c241510b0e59bc9c5ef1a7467dc860f01025.lean#L135).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9060ec828221e53864e9d560060c48d71bdbb72d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
