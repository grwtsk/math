## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fb4b4028-1c88-3ace-e9e4-15ad53979135`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 143–157.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_eq_pow_p_mul' (a : 𝕎 k) (ha : a ≠ 0) :
    ∃ (m : ℕ) (b : Units (𝕎 k)), a = (p : 𝕎 k) ^ m * b := by
  obtain ⟨m, b, h₁, h₂⟩ := exists_eq_pow_p_mul a ha
  let b₀ := Units.mk0 (b.coeff 0) h₁
  have hb₀ : b.coeff 0 = b₀ := rfl
  exact ⟨m, mkUnit hb₀, h₂⟩

Note: The following lemma should be an instance, but it seems to cause some
exponential blowups in certain typeclass resolution problems.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/DiscreteValuationRing/Variant8dedfd5de2395975545d36462cfdf59958a12d1b9b721b76830eb5dd2df57a56.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/DiscreteValuationRing/Variant8dedfd5de2395975545d36462cfdf59958a12d1b9b721b76830eb5dd2df57a56.lean#L143).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `583d1a6ba66a2cb2b7ceaea2963a895c1c0a27c1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
