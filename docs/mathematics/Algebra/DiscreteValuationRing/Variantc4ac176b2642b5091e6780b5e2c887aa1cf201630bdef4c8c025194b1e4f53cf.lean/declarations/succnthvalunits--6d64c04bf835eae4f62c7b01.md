## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:74ba662c7c08bcfce9391b9ea48eb16c55283f9d06c6631c2c576e88d724f009`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 46–54.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def succNthValUnits (n : ℕ) (a : Units k) (A : 𝕎 k) (bs : Fin (n + 1) → k) : k :=
  -↑(a⁻¹ ^ p ^ (n + 1)) *
    (A.coeff (n + 1) * ↑(a⁻¹ ^ p ^ (n + 1)) + nthRemainder p n (truncateFun (n + 1) A) bs)
#align witt_vector.succ_nth_val_units WittVector.succNthValUnits

/--
Recursively defines the sequence of coefficients for the inverse to a Witt vector whose first entry
is a unit.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/DiscreteValuationRing/Variantc4ac176b2642b5091e6780b5e2c887aa1cf201630bdef4c8c025194b1e4f53cf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/DiscreteValuationRing/Variantc4ac176b2642b5091e6780b5e2c887aa1cf201630bdef4c8c025194b1e4f53cf.lean#L46).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `511e717d8c5ac2fdba195964cb60eb1928c3823c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
