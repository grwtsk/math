## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ba7b4295f9f569b46887e50f1735ac58fbc76078ed2f672a7ab9449402f39fff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–119.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def hasSmul : SMul R (Pre R X) := ⟨fun r m ↦ mul (of_scalar r) m⟩
#align free_algebra.pre.has_smul FreeAlgebra.Pre.hasSmul

end Pre

attribute [local instance] Pre.hasCoeGenerator Pre.hasCoeSemiring Pre.hasMul Pre.hasAdd
  Pre.hasZero Pre.hasOne Pre.hasSmul

/-- Given a function from `X` to an `R`-algebra `A`, `lift_fun` provides a lift of `f` to a function
from `Pre R X` to `A`. This is mainly used in the construction of `FreeAlgebra.lift`.
-/
-- Porting note: recOn was replaced to preserve computability, see lean4#2049
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/FreeAlgebra/Variant6b60292a925d1b425e573d6d40f7ad0469d628d7cca1b6be57039b5b96dd1f6b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/FreeAlgebra/Variant6b60292a925d1b425e573d6d40f7ad0469d628d7cca1b6be57039b5b96dd1f6b.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `828542458aeb41b8cf08b916b1de9d7e975f0f65` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
