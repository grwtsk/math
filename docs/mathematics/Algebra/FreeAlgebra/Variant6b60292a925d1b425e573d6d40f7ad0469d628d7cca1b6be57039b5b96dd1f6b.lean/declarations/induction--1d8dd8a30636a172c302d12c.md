## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f191c022-6811-365c-422d-4c3904722bb1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 561–584.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem induction {C : FreeAlgebra R X → Prop}
    (h_grade0 : ∀ r, C (algebraMap R (FreeAlgebra R X) r)) (h_grade1 : ∀ x, C (ι R x))
    (h_mul : ∀ a b, C a → C b → C (a * b)) (h_add : ∀ a b, C a → C b → C (a + b))
    (a : FreeAlgebra R X) : C a := by
  -- the arguments are enough to construct a subalgebra, and a mapping into it from X
  let s : Subalgebra R (FreeAlgebra R X) :=
    { carrier := C
      mul_mem' := h_mul _ _
      add_mem' := h_add _ _
      algebraMap_mem' := h_grade0 }
  let of : X → s := Subtype.coind (ι R) h_grade1
  -- the mapping through the subalgebra is the identity
  have of_id : AlgHom.id R (FreeAlgebra R X) = s.val.comp (lift R of) := by
    ext
    simp [Subtype.coind]
  -- finding a proof is finding an element of the subalgebra
  suffices : a = lift R of a
  · rw [this]
    exact Subtype.prop (lift R of a)
  simp [AlgHom.ext_iff] at of_id
  exact of_id a
#align free_algebra.induction FreeAlgebra.induction

end FreeAlgebra
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/FreeAlgebra/Variant6b60292a925d1b425e573d6d40f7ad0469d628d7cca1b6be57039b5b96dd1f6b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/FreeAlgebra/Variant6b60292a925d1b425e573d6d40f7ad0469d628d7cca1b6be57039b5b96dd1f6b.lean#L561).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `828542458aeb41b8cf08b916b1de9d7e975f0f65` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
