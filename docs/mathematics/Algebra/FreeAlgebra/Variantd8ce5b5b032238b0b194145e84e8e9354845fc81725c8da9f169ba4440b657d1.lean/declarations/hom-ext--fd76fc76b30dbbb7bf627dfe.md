## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d084eadc-90ce-0ed8-a5f2-c0a953b003ca`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 447–456.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hom_ext {f g : FreeAlgebra R X →ₐ[R] A}
    (w : (f : FreeAlgebra R X → A) ∘ ι R = (g : FreeAlgebra R X → A) ∘ ι R) : f = g := by
  rw [← lift_symm_apply, ← lift_symm_apply] at w
  exact (lift R).symm.injective w

/-- The free algebra on `X` is "just" the monoid algebra on the free monoid on `X`.

This would be useful when constructing linear maps out of a free algebra,
for example.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/FreeAlgebra/Variantd8ce5b5b032238b0b194145e84e8e9354845fc81725c8da9f169ba4440b657d1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/FreeAlgebra/Variantd8ce5b5b032238b0b194145e84e8e9354845fc81725c8da9f169ba4440b657d1.lean#L447).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bd943abbe92ee6047d1e6b0dd4b7b9d5c3ed873a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
