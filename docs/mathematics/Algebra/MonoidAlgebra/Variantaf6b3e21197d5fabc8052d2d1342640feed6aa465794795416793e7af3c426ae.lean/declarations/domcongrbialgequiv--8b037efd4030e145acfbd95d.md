## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f0824fc377f51bad3f43eb80fd26fda667a4b839334b05d89dd17698fe48081f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def domCongrBialgEquiv (e : M ≃* N) : A[M] ≃ₐc[R] A[N] :=
  .ofAlgEquiv (domCongr R A e) (by ext <;> simp) <| by
    ext a
    · simp
    · simp [← (Coalgebra.Repr.arbitrary R a).eq]

variable (M) in
/-- The trivial monoid algebra is isomorphic to the base ring. -/
@[expose, to_additive (dont_translate := R)
/-- The trivial monoid algebra is isomorphic to the base ring. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/MonoidAlgebra/Variantaf6b3e21197d5fabc8052d2d1342640feed6aa465794795416793e7af3c426ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/MonoidAlgebra/Variantaf6b3e21197d5fabc8052d2d1342640feed6aa465794795416793e7af3c426ae.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9768d1bb74c602c76bba0c123336a06e54408c41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
