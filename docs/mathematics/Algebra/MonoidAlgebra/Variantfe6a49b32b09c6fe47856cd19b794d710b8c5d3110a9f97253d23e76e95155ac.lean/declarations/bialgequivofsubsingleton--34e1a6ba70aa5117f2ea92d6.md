## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c4f4f6d9bc159280327f38d87cf6816e9a2455a2794be229d4d6d26373904863`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–155.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def bialgEquivOfSubsingleton [Subsingleton M] : R[M] ≃ₐc[R] R where
  __ := counitBialgHom ..
  invFun := algebraMap _ _
  left_inv r := by
    change (Algebra.ofId _ _).comp (Bialgebra.counitAlgHom R _) r = AlgHom.id R _ r
    congr 1
    ext g : 2
    simp [Subsingleton.elim g 1]
  right_inv := (Bialgebra.counitAlgHom R R[M]).commutes

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/MonoidAlgebra/Variantfe6a49b32b09c6fe47856cd19b794d710b8c5d3110a9f97253d23e76e95155ac.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/MonoidAlgebra/Variantfe6a49b32b09c6fe47856cd19b794d710b8c5d3110a9f97253d23e76e95155ac.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5af9a71136ce353f26c2006bde666e2bc5cca56c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
