## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:24d8a103-36b2-1a74-be3e-a0f9de608ee8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 358–392.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! ### Completions with respect to adic valuations

Given a Dedekind domain `R` with field of fractions `K` and a maximal ideal `v` of `R`, we define
the completion of `K` with respect to its `v`-adic valuation, denoted `v.adicCompletion`, and its
ring of integers, denoted `v.adicCompletionIntegers`. -/

variable {K}

/-- `K` as a valued field with the `v`-adic valuation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/AdicValuation/Variantd6829a20fe398e33df0ece4352fd747ab7369ff8b78d4fd885cfeb66dcc99205.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/AdicValuation/Variantd6829a20fe398e33df0ece4352fd747ab7369ff8b78d4fd885cfeb66dcc99205.lean#L358).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
