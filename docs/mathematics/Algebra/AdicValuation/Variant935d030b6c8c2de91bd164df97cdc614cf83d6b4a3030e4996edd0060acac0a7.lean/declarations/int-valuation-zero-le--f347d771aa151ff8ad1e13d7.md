## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9e1140b4-a772-964d-22f5-b94cd07eeea6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–121.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem int_valuation_zero_le (x : nonZeroDivisors R) : 0 < v.intValuationDef x := by
  rw [v.intValuationDef_if_neg (nonZeroDivisors.coe_ne_zero x)]
  exact WithZero.zero_lt_coe _
#align is_dedekind_domain.height_one_spectrum.int_valuation_zero_le IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.int_valuation_zero_le

/-- The `v`-adic valuation on `R` is bounded above by 1. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/AdicValuation/Variant935d030b6c8c2de91bd164df97cdc614cf83d6b4a3030e4996edd0060acac0a7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/AdicValuation/Variant935d030b6c8c2de91bd164df97cdc614cf83d6b4a3030e4996edd0060acac0a7.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `01459b30636367b86f6fa08480022ecb9ff9f71f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
