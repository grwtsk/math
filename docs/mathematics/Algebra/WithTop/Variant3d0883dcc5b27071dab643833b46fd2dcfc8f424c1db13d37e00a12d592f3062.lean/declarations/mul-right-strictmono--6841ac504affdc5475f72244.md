## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7bae1117-a61d-1b61-8103-01a2a9e11fde`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected lemma mul_right_strictMono [PosMulStrictMono α] (h₀ : 0 < a) (hinf : a ≠ ⊤) :
    StrictMono (a * ·) := by
  lift a to α using hinf
  rintro b c hbc
  lift b to α using hbc.ne_top
  match c with
  | ⊤ => simp [← coe_mul, mul_top h₀.ne']
  | (c : α) =>
  simp only [coe_pos, coe_lt_coe, ← coe_mul, gt_iff_lt] at *
  exact mul_lt_mul_of_pos_left hbc h₀

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/WithTop/Variant3d0883dcc5b27071dab643833b46fd2dcfc8f424c1db13d37e00a12d592f3062.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/WithTop/Variant3d0883dcc5b27071dab643833b46fd2dcfc8f424c1db13d37e00a12d592f3062.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a7e51d1e7df9148d855bb60e0b37d8fef5647c41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
