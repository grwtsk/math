## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5270b6b9517864cf25922aafc38a6a8755deedcd19cc05843fdd6064f8a604bf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instNoZeroDivisors [NoZeroDivisors α] : NoZeroDivisors (WithTop α) := by
  refine ⟨fun h₁ => Decidable.byContradiction fun h₂ => ?_⟩
  rw [mul_def, ite_eq_right h₂] at h₁
  rcases Option.mem_map₂_iff.1 h₁ with ⟨a, b, (rfl : _ = _), (rfl : _ = _), hab⟩
  exact h₂ ((eq_zero_or_eq_zero_of_mul_eq_zero hab).imp (congr_arg some) (congr_arg some))

variable [Preorder α]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/WithTop/Variant3d0883dcc5b27071dab643833b46fd2dcfc8f424c1db13d37e00a12d592f3062.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/WithTop/Variant3d0883dcc5b27071dab643833b46fd2dcfc8f424c1db13d37e00a12d592f3062.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a7e51d1e7df9148d855bb60e0b37d8fef5647c41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
