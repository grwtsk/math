## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:35f678b2a7f80b426c26ae1a1691e5e31002b74b834ea6e5d0b46884e4833cd9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 103–111.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def copy (S : NonUnitalStarSubsemiring R) (s : Set R) (hs : s = ↑S) :
    NonUnitalStarSubsemiring R :=
  { S.toNonUnitalSubsemiring.copy s hs with
    star_mem' := fun {x} (hx : x ∈ s) => by
      show star x ∈ s
      rw [hs] at hx ⊢
      exact S.star_mem' hx }

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/NonUnitalSubsemiring/Variant3f0cc0a3fa8a70eb993d3c1900d4329a801f01fc17a44a2867f6ec2e9a84ce81.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/NonUnitalSubsemiring/Variant3f0cc0a3fa8a70eb993d3c1900d4329a801f01fc17a44a2867f6ec2e9a84ce81.lean#L103).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a4337f4d644e7a980a21ba14b6230239391d2c4c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
