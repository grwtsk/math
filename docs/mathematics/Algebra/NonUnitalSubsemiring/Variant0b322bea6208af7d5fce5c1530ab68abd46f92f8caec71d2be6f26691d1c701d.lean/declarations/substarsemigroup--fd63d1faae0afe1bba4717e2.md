## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0bc282fc280d9ee666fe2edb9cfffd23b36b5b1b762657872d9517177a7ced61`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 39–48.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure SubStarSemigroup (M : Type v) [Mul M] [Star M] : Type v
    extends Subsemigroup M where
  /-- The `carrier` of a `StarSubset` is closed under the `star` operation. -/
  star_mem' : ∀ {a : M} (_ha : a ∈ carrier), star a ∈ carrier

/-- Reinterpret a `SubStarSemigroup` as a `Subsemigroup`. -/
add_decl_doc SubStarSemigroup.toSubsemigroup

/-- A non-unital star subsemiring is a non-unital subsemiring which also is closed under the
`star` operation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/NonUnitalSubsemiring/Variant0b322bea6208af7d5fce5c1530ab68abd46f92f8caec71d2be6f26691d1c701d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/NonUnitalSubsemiring/Variant0b322bea6208af7d5fce5c1530ab68abd46f92f8caec71d2be6f26691d1c701d.lean#L39).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c03941f81a0ebb4645e5858102d17e43b3a9875` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
