## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b903b5fe37e8b16d6f46498868d594a1fe6e96d8bb3c51b0a45ea2ec06e3339e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 48–56.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instAlgebra : Algebra R Aᵐᵒᵖ where
  algebraMap := (algebraMap R A).toOpposite fun _ _ => Algebra.commutes _ _
  smul_def' c x := unop_injective <| by
    simp only [unop_smul, RingHom.toOpposite_apply, Function.comp_apply, unop_mul, op_mul,
      Algebra.smul_def, Algebra.commutes, op_unop, unop_op]
  commutes' r := MulOpposite.rec' fun x => by
    simp only [RingHom.toOpposite_apply, Function.comp_apply, ← op_mul, Algebra.commutes]

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Opposite/Variant0c96695633c7652e7701e928b99d884c7cb92d5e9acbac0014b0418a751a29eb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Opposite/Variant0c96695633c7652e7701e928b99d884c7cb92d5e9acbac0014b0418a751a29eb.lean#L48).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `eafe644393ede0b9a2fe614f7f3eb862517946e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
