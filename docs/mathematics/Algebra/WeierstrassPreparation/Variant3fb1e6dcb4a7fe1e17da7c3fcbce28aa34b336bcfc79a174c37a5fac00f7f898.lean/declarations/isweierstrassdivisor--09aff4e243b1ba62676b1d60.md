## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:691a44eb6531bfaafb92025d3fef49c908238a9250754e6f497bb4cd96ca49cc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 145–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev IsWeierstrassDivisor [IsLocalRing A] : Prop :=
  g.IsWeierstrassDivisorAt (IsLocalRing.maximalIdeal A)

variable {g} in
/-- If `g` is a power series over a local ring such that
its image in the residue field is not zero, then `g` can be used as a Weierstrass divisor. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/WeierstrassPreparation/Variant3fb1e6dcb4a7fe1e17da7c3fcbce28aa34b336bcfc79a174c37a5fac00f7f898.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/WeierstrassPreparation/Variant3fb1e6dcb4a7fe1e17da7c3fcbce28aa34b336bcfc79a174c37a5fac00f7f898.lean#L145).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `79131c1412bbd5c6ba1f9655dce9b7439c091c75` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
