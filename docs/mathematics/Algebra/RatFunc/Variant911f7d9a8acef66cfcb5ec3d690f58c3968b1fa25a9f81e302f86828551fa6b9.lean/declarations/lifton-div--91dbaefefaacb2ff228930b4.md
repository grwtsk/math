## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2f9d9a63-c073-856b-3aac-5ce0dff55fc7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1021–1033.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem liftOn'_div {P : Sort v} (p q : K[X]) (f : ∀ _p _q : K[X], P) (f0 : ∀ p, f p 0 = f 0 1)
    (H) :
    (RatFunc.liftOn' (algebraMap _ (RatFunc K) p / algebraMap _ _ q)) f @H = f p q := by
  rw [RatFunc.liftOn', liftOn_div _ _ _ f0]
  apply lift_on_condition_of_lift_on'_condition H -- porting note: `exact` did not work.  Also,
                                                  -- was `@H` that still works, but is not needed.
#align ratfunc.lift_on'_div RatFunc.liftOn'_div

/-- Induction principle for `RatFunc K`: if `f p q : P (p / q)` for all `p q : K[X]`,
then `P` holds on all elements of `RatFunc K`.

See also `induction_on'`, which is a recursion principle defined in terms of `RatFunc.mk`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RatFunc/Variant911f7d9a8acef66cfcb5ec3d690f58c3968b1fa25a9f81e302f86828551fa6b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RatFunc/Variant911f7d9a8acef66cfcb5ec3d690f58c3968b1fa25a9f81e302f86828551fa6b9.lean#L1021).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d13c6afd04fada6eb5221b3c4e8041d1403e570` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
