## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2c7cce2a-3a4f-affa-02bf-e79905658bff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 698–706.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
nonrec theorem Ideal.mem_normalizedFactors_iff {p I : Ideal A} (hI : I ≠ ⊥) :
    p ∈ normalizedFactors I ↔ p.IsPrime ∧ I ≤ p := by
  rw [← Ideal.dvd_iff_le]
  by_cases hp : p = 0
  · rw [← zero_eq_bot] at hI
    simp only [hp, zero_notMem_normalizedFactors, zero_dvd_iff, hI, false_iff, not_and,
      not_false_eq_true, implies_true]
  · rwa [mem_normalizedFactors_iff hI, prime_iff_isPrime]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Ideal/Variant3b1361fe8da2dc8b2f8cdcf20b06bf4a29fccf64a63e9e58a9af67235a918d1d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ideal/Variant3b1361fe8da2dc8b2f8cdcf20b06bf4a29fccf64a63e9e58a9af67235a918d1d.lean#L698).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e90daecbecdebee2e650dd3e06b56eebdb71422e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
