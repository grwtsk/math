## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7fcf6ac1d5a5ca9a775315c00289c9e1b366bb772cf06abd154860d4bb68549d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1398–1424.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def normalizedFactorsEquivSpanNormalizedFactors {r : R} (hr : r ≠ 0) :
    { d : R | d ∈ normalizedFactors r } ≃
      { I : Ideal R | I ∈ normalizedFactors (Ideal.span ({r} : Set R)) } := by

      ⟨Ideal.span {↑d}, singleton_span_mem_normalizedFactors_of_mem_normalizedFactors d.prop⟩
  · refine ⟨?_, ?_⟩

      have := exists_mem_normalizedFactors_of_dvd hr

        (prime_of_normalized_factor i hi).ne_zero).irreducible ?_

        use ⟨a, ha⟩
        simp only [Subtype.coe_mk, Subtype.mk_eq_mk, ← span_singleton_eq_span_singleton.mpr ha',
            Ideal.span_singleton_generator]
      · exact (Submodule.IsPrincipal.mem_iff_generator_dvd i).mp
          ((show Ideal.span {r} ≤ i from dvd_iff_le.mp (dvd_of_mem_normalizedFactors hi))
            (mem_span_singleton.mpr (dvd_refl r)))

/-- The bijection `normalizedFactorsEquivSpanNormalizedFactors` between the set of prime
    factors of `r` and the set of prime factors of the ideal `⟨r⟩` preserves multiplicities. See
    `count_normalizedFactorsSpan_eq_count` for the version stated in terms of multisets `count`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Ideal/Variant3b1361fe8da2dc8b2f8cdcf20b06bf4a29fccf64a63e9e58a9af67235a918d1d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ideal/Variant3b1361fe8da2dc8b2f8cdcf20b06bf4a29fccf64a63e9e58a9af67235a918d1d.lean#L1398).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e90daecbecdebee2e650dd3e06b56eebdb71422e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
