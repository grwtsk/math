## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:53915397607e88235481dde5de896f935d0ec7239a9dc1e41bb2a6b6421d9bea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 579–586.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def HomogeneousIdeal.irrelevant : HomogeneousIdeal 𝒜 :=
  ⟨RingHom.ker (GradedRing.projZeroRingHom 𝒜), fun i r (hr : (decompose 𝒜 r 0 : A) = 0) => by
    change (decompose 𝒜 (decompose 𝒜 r _ : A) 0 : A) = 0
    by_cases h : i = 0
    · rw [h, hr, decompose_zero, zero_apply, ZeroMemClass.coe_zero]
    · rw [decompose_of_mem_ne 𝒜 (SetLike.coe_mem _) h]⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Ideal/Variantde89b7a25dcf02b8f6213366a04e6b6eb16b47d1f18c937922d4b934c1093477.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ideal/Variantde89b7a25dcf02b8f6213366a04e6b6eb16b47d1f18c937922d4b934c1093477.lean#L579).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a7070e50390fa017b0f88248f63222cdb903989` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
