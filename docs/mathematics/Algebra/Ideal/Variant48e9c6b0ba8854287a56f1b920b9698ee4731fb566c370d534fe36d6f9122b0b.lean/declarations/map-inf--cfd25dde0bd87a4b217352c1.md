## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ce9fcb54-fbe4-d6e6-413e-15321e55a620`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–108.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem map_inf (I J : Ideal R) :
    (I ⊓ J).map (algebraMap R S) = I.map (algebraMap R S) ⊓ J.map (algebraMap R S) := by
  refine le_antisymm (Ideal.map_inf_le (algebraMap R S)) fun x hx ↦ ?_
  simp only [Ideal.mem_inf, IsLocalization.mem_map_algebraMap_iff M, Prod.exists] at hx ⊢
  obtain ⟨⟨⟨i, hi⟩, mi, hi'⟩, ⟨j, hj⟩, mj, hj'⟩ := hx
  simp only [← IsLocalization.eq_mk'_iff_mul_eq] at hi' hj'
  obtain ⟨m, hm⟩ := IsLocalization.eq.mp (hi'.symm.trans hj')
  rw [← mul_assoc, ← mul_assoc, mul_comm, ← mul_comm (j : R)] at hm
  refine ⟨⟨i * (m * mj : M), I.mul_mem_right _ hi, hm ▸ J.mul_mem_right _ hj⟩, mi * (m * mj), ?_⟩
  rwa [← IsLocalization.eq_mk'_iff_mul_eq, Subtype.coe_mk, IsLocalization.mk'_cancel]

/-- `IsLocalization.map_inf` as an `FrameHom`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Ideal/Variant48e9c6b0ba8854287a56f1b920b9698ee4731fb566c370d534fe36d6f9122b0b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ideal/Variant48e9c6b0ba8854287a56f1b920b9698ee4731fb566c370d534fe36d6f9122b0b.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1521d90abd85c361b282cc6052c254b7663dd2a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
