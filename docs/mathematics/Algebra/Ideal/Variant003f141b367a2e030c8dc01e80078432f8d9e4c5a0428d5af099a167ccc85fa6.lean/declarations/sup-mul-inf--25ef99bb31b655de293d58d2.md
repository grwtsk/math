## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:60c6b1a7-c188-ff02-d523-e416392512d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 842–862.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sup_mul_inf (I J : Ideal A) : (I ⊔ J) * (I ⊓ J) = I * J := by
  letI := Classical.decEq (Ideal A)
  letI := Classical.decEq (Associates (Ideal A))
  letI := UniqueFactorizationMonoid.toNormalizedGCDMonoid (Ideal A)
  have hgcd : gcd I J = I ⊔ J := by
    rw [gcd_eq_normalize _ _, normalize_eq]
    · rw [dvd_iff_le, sup_le_iff, ← dvd_iff_le, ← dvd_iff_le]

  have hlcm : lcm I J = I ⊓ J := by

    · rw [dvd_iff_le, le_inf_iff, ← dvd_iff_le, ← dvd_iff_le]

/-- Ideals in a Dedekind domain have gcd and lcm operators that (trivially) are compatible with
the normalization operator. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Ideal/Variant003f141b367a2e030c8dc01e80078432f8d9e4c5a0428d5af099a167ccc85fa6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ideal/Variant003f141b367a2e030c8dc01e80078432f8d9e4c5a0428d5af099a167ccc85fa6.lean#L842).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ebaae1e55906a2e45da6c0f703da3ac57a9f1c56` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
