## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6fbd47118cf464b25ead882d180dfdafc3dd4b55e717606d692297e0e498f6f9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1159–1174.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def normalizedFactorsEquivOfQuotEquiv (hI : I ≠ ⊥) (hJ : J ≠ ⊥) :
    { L : Ideal R | L ∈ normalizedFactors I } ≃ { M : Ideal A | M ∈ normalizedFactors J } where
  toFun j :=
    ⟨idealFactorsEquivOfQuotEquiv f ⟨↑j, dvd_of_mem_normalizedFactors j.prop⟩,
      idealFactorsEquivOfQuotEquiv_mem_normalizedFactors_of_mem_normalizedFactors f hJ j.prop⟩
  invFun j :=
    ⟨(idealFactorsEquivOfQuotEquiv f).symm ⟨↑j, dvd_of_mem_normalizedFactors j.prop⟩, by
      rw [idealFactorsEquivOfQuotEquiv_symm]
      exact
        idealFactorsEquivOfQuotEquiv_mem_normalizedFactors_of_mem_normalizedFactors f.symm hI
          j.prop⟩
  left_inv := fun ⟨j, hj⟩ => by simp
  right_inv := fun ⟨j, hj⟩ => by simp
#align normalized_factors_equiv_of_quot_equiv normalizedFactorsEquivOfQuotEquiv

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Ideal/Variant003f141b367a2e030c8dc01e80078432f8d9e4c5a0428d5af099a167ccc85fa6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ideal/Variant003f141b367a2e030c8dc01e80078432f8d9e4c5a0428d5af099a167ccc85fa6.lean#L1159).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ebaae1e55906a2e45da6c0f703da3ac57a9f1c56` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
