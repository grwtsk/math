## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:444e8e15b1dab269bceff53f4c49b4d64a71b3876cc6573d2f2ef6a1f553938f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 546–551.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Ideal.homogeneousHull.gi : GaloisInsertion (Ideal.homogeneousHull 𝒜) toIdeal where
  choice I H := ⟨I, le_antisymm H (I.le_toIdeal_homogeneousHull 𝒜) ▸ isHomogeneous _⟩
  gc := Ideal.homogeneousHull.gc 𝒜
  le_l_u _ := Ideal.le_toIdeal_homogeneousHull _ _
  choice_eq I H := le_antisymm (I.le_toIdeal_homogeneousHull 𝒜) H

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Ideal/Variantae61a9f6da0ba56c658086441bf123296b2b77c216fea1fa445e98eab27bf347.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ideal/Variantae61a9f6da0ba56c658086441bf123296b2b77c216fea1fa445e98eab27bf347.lean#L546).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4fa71a7fb9615044f8609812ca543d5c7131462` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
