## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:960e9933-50be-6291-0c2d-bc82c7490293`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 468–484.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

section CommRing

/-!
We now verify that in the case of a commutative ring, the `RingQuot` construction
agrees with the quotient by the appropriate ideal.

variable {B : Type uR} [CommRing B]

/-- The universal ring homomorphism from `RingQuot r` to `B ⧸ Ideal.ofRel r`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingQuot/Variant9f9ea6b9ab09311b602b05934d3dde81e52c73070a32280de758aaac39aceaea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RingQuot/Variant9f9ea6b9ab09311b602b05934d3dde81e52c73070a32280de758aaac39aceaea.lean#L468).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5f4b3eab78e482a95e7dd03469b199ec730067d9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
