## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:533ac5e17bc16a0544f00b4b16d3575d69496931e186f4e5ce060885801cb446`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 370–393.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instAlgebra [Algebra S R] (r : R → R → Prop) : Algebra S (RingQuot r) where
  smul := (· • ·)
  algebraMap :=
  { toFun r := ⟨Quot.mk _ (algebraMap S R r)⟩
    map_one' := by simp [← one_quot]
    map_mul' := by simp [mul_quot]
    map_zero' := by simp [← zero_quot]
    map_add' := by simp [add_quot] }
  commutes' r := by
    rintro ⟨⟨a⟩⟩
    simp [Algebra.commutes, mul_quot]
  smul_def' r := by
    rintro ⟨⟨a⟩⟩
    simp [smul_quot, Algebra.smul_def, mul_quot]

/-- The quotient map from a ring to its quotient, as a homomorphism of rings.
-/
irreducible_def mkRingHom (r : R → R → Prop) : R →+* RingQuot r :=
  { toFun := fun x ↦ ⟨Quot.mk _ x⟩
    map_one' := by simp [← one_quot]
    map_mul' := by simp [mul_quot]
    map_zero' := by simp [← zero_quot]
    map_add' := by simp [add_quot] }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingQuot/Variantf0faae84a6c8f96b08da86eec3bd253d38e55bbf1d6a1f1ddf75899a2a921f7c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RingQuot/Variantf0faae84a6c8f96b08da86eec3bd253d38e55bbf1d6a1f1ddf75899a2a921f7c.lean#L370).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e037adeab9b192f45e09e36d49b0dec6fee6d9e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
