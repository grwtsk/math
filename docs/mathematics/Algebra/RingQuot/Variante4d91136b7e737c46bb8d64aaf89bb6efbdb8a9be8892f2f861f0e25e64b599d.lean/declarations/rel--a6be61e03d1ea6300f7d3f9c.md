## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:406d747bac4060852a25a74ecdc60c959d2226c191b9ec7b28441a468311ff97`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 41–46.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive Rel (r : R → R → Prop) : R → R → Prop
  | of ⦃x y : R⦄ (h : r x y) : Rel r x y
  | add_left ⦃a b c⦄ : Rel r a b → Rel r (a + c) (b + c)
  | mul_left ⦃a b c⦄ : Rel r a b → Rel r (a * c) (b * c)
  | mul_right ⦃a b c⦄ : Rel r b c → Rel r (a * b) (a * c)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RingQuot/Variante4d91136b7e737c46bb8d64aaf89bb6efbdb8a9be8892f2f861f0e25e64b599d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RingQuot/Variante4d91136b7e737c46bb8d64aaf89bb6efbdb8a9be8892f2f861f0e25e64b599d.lean#L41).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `26ba397acab1672dc3e4e3fea49caa7877b18e91` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
