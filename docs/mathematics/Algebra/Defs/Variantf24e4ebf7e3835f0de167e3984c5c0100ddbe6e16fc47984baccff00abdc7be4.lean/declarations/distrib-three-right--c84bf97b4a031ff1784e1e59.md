## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a1b7b844-21ed-304b-bd85-b49d55b16cf0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (a + b + c) * d = a * d + b * d + c * d := by simp [right_distrib]

### Classes of semirings and rings

We make sure that the canonical path from `NonAssocSemiring` to `Ring` passes through `Semiring`,
as this is a path which is followed all the time in linear algebra where the defining semilinear map
`σ : R →+* S` depends on the `NonAssocSemiring` structure of `R` and `S` while the module
definition depends on the `Semiring` structure.

It is not currently possible to adjust priorities by hand (see https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/2115). Instead, the last
declared instance is used, so we make sure that `Semiring` is declared after `NonAssocRing`, so
that `Semiring -> NonAssocSemiring` is tried before `NonAssocRing -> NonAssocSemiring`.
TODO: clean this once https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/2115 is fixed
-/

/-- A not-necessarily-unital, not-necessarily-associative semiring. See `CommutatorRing` and the
  documentation thereof in case you need a `NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring` instance on a Lie ring
  or a Lie algebra. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variantf24e4ebf7e3835f0de167e3984c5c0100ddbe6e16fc47984baccff00abdc7be4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variantf24e4ebf7e3835f0de167e3984c5c0100ddbe6e16fc47984baccff00abdc7be4.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e6f9dd3e35cbf8c99c3e643c3c8bc1a1c6a361a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
