## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d24f38ca-d05a-a3f8-b52e-829eedf79d4f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 634–642.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_comp_map {A : Type*} [CommSemiring A] {U : Submonoid A} {W} [CommSemiring W]
    [Algebra A W] [IsLocalization U W] {l : P →+* A} (hl : T ≤ U.comap l) :
    (map W l hl).comp (map Q g hy : S →+* _) = map W (l.comp g) fun _ hx => hl (hy hx) :=
  RingHom.ext fun x =>
    Submonoid.LocalizationMap.map_map (P := P) (toLocalizationMap M S) (fun y => hy y.2)
      (toLocalizationMap U W) (fun w => hl w.2) x

/-- If `CommSemiring` homs `g : R →+* P, l : P →+* A` induce maps of localizations, the composition
of the induced maps equals the map of localizations induced by `l ∘ g`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variant34cda8869265c686ce743cb923173711d8ea5420510008809e29fafd02105f99.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variant34cda8869265c686ce743cb923173711d8ea5420510008809e29fafd02105f99.lean#L634).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4b40f765a01fb76a20359ed66a0436fa21a862c3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
