## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:87a85ea7-7573-fd22-d07c-0aec7ead2f98`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 629–632.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_mk' (x) (y : M) : map Q g hy (mk' S x y) = mk' Q (g x) ⟨g y, hy y.2⟩ :=
  Submonoid.LocalizationMap.map_mk' (toLocalizationMap M S) (g := g.toMonoidHom)
    (fun y => hy y.2) (k := toLocalizationMap T Q) ..

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variant4f33f06b2fa8f52a4c9d4aa645e944402e9c4369b87c00d225dc828500ac8fe4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variant4f33f06b2fa8f52a4c9d4aa645e944402e9c4369b87c00d225dc828500ac8fe4.lean#L629).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e010232244b047a8e16cf571168f4c35c1ed87ad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
