## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:75e78a217b81cef317aeb342b213bb0bf28213e26c885ebed5214b4fb8ee02b0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 488–507.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def lift {g : R →+* P} (hg : ∀ y : M, IsUnit (g y)) : S →+* P :=
  { (toLocalizationMap M S).lift₀ g.toMonoidWithZeroHom hg with
    map_add' := by
      intro x y
      dsimp
      rw [(toLocalizationMap M S).lift₀_def, (toLocalizationMap M S).lift_spec,
        mul_add, mul_comm, eq_comm, lift_spec_mul_add, add_comm, mul_comm, mul_assoc, mul_comm,
        mul_assoc, lift_spec_mul_add]
      simp_rw [← mul_assoc]
      change g _ * g _ * g _ + g _ * g _ * g _ = g _ * g _ * g _
      simp_rw [← map_mul g, ← map_add g]
      apply eq_of_eq (S := S) hg
      simp only [sec_spec', toLocalizationMap_sec, map_add, map_mul]
      ring }

variable {g : R →+* P} (hg : ∀ y : M, IsUnit (g y))

/-- Given a localization map `f : R →+* S` for a submonoid `M ⊆ R` and a map of `CommSemiring`s
`g : R →* P` such that `g y` is invertible for all `y : M`, the homomorphism induced from
`S` to `P` maps `f x * (f y)⁻¹` to `g x * (g y)⁻¹` for all `x : R, y ∈ M`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variantb4861bdfcdc514706866e0f7707cba5fcee922b10fb56e9482f7b702b3a6be8d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variantb4861bdfcdc514706866e0f7707cba5fcee922b10fb56e9482f7b702b3a6be8d.lean#L488).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cd24e373b44241083605b53458dd44c516c6767c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
