## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4e1ea879ac5af57349fe8ffba899bf850405704bd1ff9d39b9587867e2057b5b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 110–122.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def SMulZeroClass.toZeroHom (x : M) :
    ZeroHom A A where
  toFun := (x • ·)
  map_zero' := smul_zero x

end smul_zero

section Zero
variable (M₀ A)

/-- `SMulWithZero` is a class consisting of a Type `M₀` with `0 ∈ M₀` and a scalar multiplication
of `M₀` on a Type `A` with `0`, such that the equality `r • m = 0` holds if at least one among `r`
or `m` equals `0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variantb7469ccf9a7d9135d4967e8f5a0c16f28488538203c6a88fe344d1a6ab065dc1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variantb7469ccf9a7d9135d4967e8f5a0c16f28488538203c6a88fe344d1a6ab065dc1.lean#L110).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f0574464fd9edf6965ebf6887ae3c3c9ac02b238` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
