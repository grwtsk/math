## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2227193ad01c90b55c891d09a2ae036ae8eff4285fbd8ffb5b69f5df8d582978`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 317–326.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev Function.Surjective.distribSMulLeft {R S M : Type*} [AddZeroClass M] [DistribSMul R M]
    [SMul S M] (f : R → S) (hf : Function.Surjective f)
    (hsmul : ∀ (c) (x : M), f c • x = c • x) : DistribSMul S M :=
  { hf.smulZeroClassLeft f hsmul with
    smul_add := hf.forall.mpr fun c x y => by simp only [hsmul, smul_add] }

variable (A)

/-- Compose a `DistribSMul` with a function, with scalar multiplication `f r' • m`.
See note [reducible non-instances]. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variantb7469ccf9a7d9135d4967e8f5a0c16f28488538203c6a88fe344d1a6ab065dc1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variantb7469ccf9a7d9135d4967e8f5a0c16f28488538203c6a88fe344d1a6ab065dc1.lean#L317).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f0574464fd9edf6965ebf6887ae3c3c9ac02b238` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
