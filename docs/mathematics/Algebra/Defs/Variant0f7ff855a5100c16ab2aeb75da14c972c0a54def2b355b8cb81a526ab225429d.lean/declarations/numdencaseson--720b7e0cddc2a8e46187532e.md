## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:713109ad90fe87a6a1be671f83470cb1f29c3a63e8e073328dc694019a940fe5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 131–139.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def numDenCasesOn'.{u} {C : ℚ → Sort u} (a : ℚ) (H : ∀ (n : ℤ) (d : ℕ), d ≠ 0 → C (n /. d)) :
    C a :=
  numDenCasesOn a fun n d h _ => H n d h.ne'
#align rat.num_denom_cases_on' Rat.numDenCasesOn'

#align rat.add Rat.add

-- Porting note: there's already an instance for `Add ℚ` is in Std.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variant0f7ff855a5100c16ab2aeb75da14c972c0a54def2b355b8cb81a526ab225429d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variant0f7ff855a5100c16ab2aeb75da14c972c0a54def2b355b8cb81a526ab225429d.lean#L131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a36d92b5f0be7d3303a375cb136f13a544481eb0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
