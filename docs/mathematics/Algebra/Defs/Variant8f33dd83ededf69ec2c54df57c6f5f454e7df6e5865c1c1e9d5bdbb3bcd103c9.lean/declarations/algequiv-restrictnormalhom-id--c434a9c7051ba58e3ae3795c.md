## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:09c0bfc2-c3d6-ec9d-eee5-e7058f79b06a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 203–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

namespace IsScalarTower

/-- In a scalar tower `K₃/K₂/K₁/F` with `K₁` and `K₂` are normal over `F`, the group homomorphism
given by the restriction of algebra isomorphisms of `K₃` to `K₁` is equal to the composition of
the group homomorphism given by the restricting an algebra isomorphism of `K₃` to `K₂` and
the group homomorphism given by the restricting an algebra isomorphism of `K₂` to `K₁` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variant8f33dd83ededf69ec2c54df57c6f5f454e7df6e5865c1c1e9d5bdbb3bcd103c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variant8f33dd83ededf69ec2c54df57c6f5f454e7df6e5865c1c1e9d5bdbb3bcd103c9.lean#L203).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3d0ce1a7c1c2d7452f117ca5e8906ae148d6f802` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
