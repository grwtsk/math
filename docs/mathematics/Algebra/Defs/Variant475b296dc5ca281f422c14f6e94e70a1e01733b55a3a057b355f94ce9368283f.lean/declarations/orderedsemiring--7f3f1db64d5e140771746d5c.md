## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:87fd2ca6d2e708e000adb6af61d7551fe57c77e3110a314ef4d8f3287aab9875`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 138–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class OrderedSemiring (α : Type u) extends Semiring α, OrderedAddCommMonoid α where
  /-- `0 ≤ 1` in any ordered semiring. -/
  protected zero_le_one : (0 : α) ≤ 1
  /-- In an ordered semiring, we can multiply an inequality `a ≤ b` on the left
  by a non-negative element `0 ≤ c` to obtain `c * a ≤ c * b`. -/
  protected mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left : ∀ a b c : α, a ≤ b → 0 ≤ c → c * a ≤ c * b
  /-- In an ordered semiring, we can multiply an inequality `a ≤ b` on the right
  by a non-negative element `0 ≤ c` to obtain `a * c ≤ b * c`. -/
  protected mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right : ∀ a b c : α, a ≤ b → 0 ≤ c → a * c ≤ b * c
#align ordered_semiring OrderedSemiring

/-- An `OrderedCommSemiring` is a commutative semiring with a partial order such that addition is
monotone and multiplication by a nonnegative number is monotone. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variant475b296dc5ca281f422c14f6e94e70a1e01733b55a3a057b355f94ce9368283f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variant475b296dc5ca281f422c14f6e94e70a1e01733b55a3a057b355f94ce9368283f.lean#L138).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `34d6b032e2a00c89628e46019a0a8ce6c7a7f5c9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
