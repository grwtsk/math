## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:66ab9f4b62a40574cd1a0fc9bd81b55d8fca3d67b5381c83b0d441ae1fc673f1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–67.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class RightDistribClass (R : Type*) [Mul R] [Add R] : Prop where
  /-- Multiplication is right distributive over addition -/
  protected right_distrib : ∀ a b c : R, (a + b) * c = a * c + b * c
#align right_distrib_class RightDistribClass

-- see Note [lower instance priority]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variantf83a64c7769460fa14ed570d1b0a703d422c2841010e022e9bc307d35ab8f995.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variantf83a64c7769460fa14ed570d1b0a703d422c2841010e022e9bc307d35ab8f995.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `465f793c1031d9d45b54455380f7d5aeb8d70515` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
