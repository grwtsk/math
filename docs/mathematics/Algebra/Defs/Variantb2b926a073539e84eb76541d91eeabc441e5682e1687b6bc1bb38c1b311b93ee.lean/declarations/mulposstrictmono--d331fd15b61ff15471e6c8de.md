## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:636dec52d5c286a7516060638f77af0770c6c26dc22182b2b9e151030798db3c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 130–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[mk_iff] class MulPosStrictMono : Prop extends CovariantClass α>0 α (fun x y => y * x) (· < ·)

/-- Typeclass for strict reverse monotonicity of multiplication by nonnegative elements on
the right, namely `a₁ * b < a₂ * b → a₁ < a₂` if `0 ≤ b`.

You should usually not use this very granular typeclass directly, but rather a typeclass like
`LinearOrderedSemiring`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variantb2b926a073539e84eb76541d91eeabc441e5682e1687b6bc1bb38c1b311b93ee.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variantb2b926a073539e84eb76541d91eeabc441e5682e1687b6bc1bb38c1b311b93ee.lean#L130).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `99f5c94b11b95b41da015a772f3ee4b444bb12ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
