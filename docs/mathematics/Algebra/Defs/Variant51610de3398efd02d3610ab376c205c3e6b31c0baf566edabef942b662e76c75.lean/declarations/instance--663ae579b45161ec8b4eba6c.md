## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:34f067c2cf14aa9c361a6943acc9bc18240d4a22b846eaf5c7221a853dc13e9f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 773–783.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) StrictOrderedCommRing.toOrderedCommRing : OrderedCommRing α :=
  { ‹StrictOrderedCommRing α›, StrictOrderedRing.toOrderedRing with }
#align strict_ordered_comm_ring.to_ordered_comm_ring StrictOrderedCommRing.toOrderedCommRing

end StrictOrderedCommRing

section LinearOrderedSemiring

variable [LinearOrderedSemiring α] {a b c d : α}

-- see Note [lower instance priority]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variant51610de3398efd02d3610ab376c205c3e6b31c0baf566edabef942b662e76c75.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variant51610de3398efd02d3610ab376c205c3e6b31c0baf566edabef942b662e76c75.lean#L773).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5b6352bb3954ee7b2d3e9a95de1456db50e2b00a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
