## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f319fd9a45c150105b58210253d814e892b48132d7c4cb180f42fc5857f9e4e4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–257.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev ofModule [CommSemiring R] [Semiring A] [Module R A]
    (h₁ : ∀ (r : R) (x y : A), r • x * y = r • (x * y))
    (h₂ : ∀ (r : R) (x y : A), x * r • y = r • (x * y)) : Algebra R A :=
  ofModule' (fun r x => by rw [h₁, one_mul]) fun r x => by rw [h₂, mul_one]

section Semiring

variable [CommSemiring R] [CommSemiring S]
variable [Semiring A] [Algebra R A]

-- We'll later use this to show `Algebra ℤ M` is a subsingleton.
/-- To prove two algebra structures on a fixed `[CommSemiring R] [Semiring A]` agree,
it suffices to check the `algebraMap`s agree.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variantd44bd9bbd90099f252798bca1029225896441cdc20baffdfb8cad2af1d13b7c4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variantd44bd9bbd90099f252798bca1029225896441cdc20baffdfb8cad2af1d13b7c4.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7fdf7f16581cbc72979764db38b5e2cdf355ea50` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
