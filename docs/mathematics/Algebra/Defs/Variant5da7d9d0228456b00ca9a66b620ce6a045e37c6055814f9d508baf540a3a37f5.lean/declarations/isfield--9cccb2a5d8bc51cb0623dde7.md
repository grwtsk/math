## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2b1074535df46967def11cf7a28d501fbc0578a62c5ead0f637a7ebde8d2cbae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 186–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure IsField (R : Type u) [Semiring R] : Prop where
  /-- For a semiring to be a field, it must have two distinct elements. -/
  exists_pair_ne : ∃ x y : R, x ≠ y
  /-- Fields are commutative. -/
  mul_comm : ∀ x y : R, x * y = y * x
  /-- Nonzero elements have multiplicative inverses. -/
  mul_inv_cancel : ∀ {a : R}, a ≠ 0 → ∃ b, a * b = 1
#align is_field IsField

/-- Transferring from `Semifield` to `IsField`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variant5da7d9d0228456b00ca9a66b620ce6a045e37c6055814f9d508baf540a3a37f5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variant5da7d9d0228456b00ca9a66b620ce6a045e37c6055814f9d508baf540a3a37f5.lean#L186).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee90f30fd6c9b73ec876118aa08eae2be49abda5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
