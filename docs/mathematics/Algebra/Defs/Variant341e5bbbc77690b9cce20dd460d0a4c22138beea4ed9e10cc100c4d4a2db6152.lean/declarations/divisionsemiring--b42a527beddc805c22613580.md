## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f385bace9685d564ebbd5bd7d7893e96e551fdf9af2ce4a9d8e476575b782b23`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 86–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class DivisionSemiring (K : Type*) extends Semiring K, GroupWithZero K, NNRatCast K where
  protected nnratCast := NNRat.castRec
  /-- However `NNRat.cast` is defined, it must be propositionally equal to `a / b`.

  Do not use this lemma directly. Use `NNRat.cast_def` instead. -/
  protected nnratCast_def (q : ℚ≥0) : (NNRat.cast q : K) = q.num / q.den := by intros; rfl
  /-- Scalar multiplication by a nonnegative rational number.

  Unless there is a risk of a `Module ℚ≥0 _` instance diamond, write `nnqsmul := _`. This will set
  `nnqsmul` to `(NNRat.cast · * ·)` thanks to unification in the default proof of `nnqsmul_def`.

  Do not use directly. Instead use the `•` notation. -/
  protected nnqsmul : ℚ≥0 → K → K
  /-- However `qsmul` is defined, it must be propositionally equal to multiplication by `Rat.cast`.

  Do not use this lemma directly. Use `NNRat.smul_def` instead. -/
  protected nnqsmul_def (q : ℚ≥0) (a : K) : nnqsmul q a = NNRat.cast q * a := by intros; rfl

attribute [instance 500] DivisionSemiring.toSemiring

/-- A `DivisionRing` is a `Ring` with multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements.

An instance of `DivisionRing K` includes maps `ratCast : ℚ → K` and `qsmul : ℚ → K → K`.
Those two fields are needed to implement the `DivisionRing K → Algebra ℚ K` instance since we need
to control the specific definitions for some special cases of `K` (in particular `K = ℚ` itself).
See also note [forgetful inheritance]. Similarly, there are maps `nnratCast ℚ≥0 → K` and
`nnqsmul : ℚ≥0 → K → K` to implement the `DivisionSemiring K → Algebra ℚ≥0 K` instance.

If the division ring has positive characteristic `p`, our division by zero convention forces
`ratCast (1 / p) = 1 / 0 = 0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variant341e5bbbc77690b9cce20dd460d0a4c22138beea4ed9e10cc100c4d4a2db6152.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variant341e5bbbc77690b9cce20dd460d0a4c22138beea4ed9e10cc100c4d4a2db6152.lean#L86).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c7cfb7246b4896ec3fc910efbfdeb50261baddeb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
