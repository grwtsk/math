## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bbd6b8f4d988769c972867384cf2fd61822194e16a1a1e7ddffee1d1d08f1f2d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 112–151.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class DivisionRing (K : Type*)
  extends Ring K, DivInvMonoid K, Nontrivial K, NNRatCast K, RatCast K where
  /-- For a nonzero `a`, `a⁻¹` is a right multiplicative inverse. -/
  protected mul_inv_cancel : ∀ (a : K), a ≠ 0 → a * a⁻¹ = 1
  /-- The inverse of `0` is `0` by convention. -/
  protected inv_zero : (0 : K)⁻¹ = 0
  protected nnratCast := NNRat.castRec
  /-- However `NNRat.cast` is defined, it must be equal to `a / b`.

  Do not use this lemma directly. Use `NNRat.cast_def` instead. -/
  protected nnratCast_def (q : ℚ≥0) : (NNRat.cast q : K) = q.num / q.den := by intros; rfl
  /-- Scalar multiplication by a nonnegative rational number.

  Unless there is a risk of a `Module ℚ≥0 _` instance diamond, write `nnqsmul := _`. This will set
  `nnqsmul` to `(NNRat.cast · * ·)` thanks to unification in the default proof of `nnqsmul_def`.

  Do not use directly. Instead use the `•` notation. -/
  protected nnqsmul : ℚ≥0 → K → K
  /-- However `qsmul` is defined, it must be propositionally equal to multiplication by `Rat.cast`.

  Do not use this lemma directly. Use `NNRat.smul_def` instead. -/
  protected nnqsmul_def (q : ℚ≥0) (a : K) : nnqsmul q a = NNRat.cast q * a := by intros; rfl
  protected ratCast := Rat.castRec
  /-- However `Rat.cast q` is defined, it must be propositionally equal to `q.num / q.den`.

  Do not use this lemma directly. Use `Rat.cast_def` instead. -/
  protected ratCast_def (q : ℚ) : (Rat.cast q : K) = q.num / q.den := by intros; rfl
  /-- Scalar multiplication by a rational number.

  Unless there is a risk of a `Module ℚ _` instance diamond, write `qsmul := _`. This will set
  `qsmul` to `(Rat.cast · * ·)` thanks to unification in the default proof of `qsmul_def`.

  Do not use directly. Instead use the `•` notation. -/
  protected qsmul : ℚ → K → K
  /-- However `qsmul` is defined, it must be propositionally equal to multiplication by `Rat.cast`.

  Do not use this lemma directly. Use `Rat.cast_def` instead. -/
  protected qsmul_def (a : ℚ) (x : K) : qsmul a x = Rat.cast a * x := by intros; rfl

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Defs/Variant8fc4e2e1a3464f05fa92bc4f6d31daece2f70a508f1094e5fda3c21957dac151.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Defs/Variant8fc4e2e1a3464f05fa92bc4f6d31daece2f70a508f1094e5fda3c21957dac151.lean#L112).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `08afcf9a9fb0db39e66fa6f992582edcdfa249b9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
