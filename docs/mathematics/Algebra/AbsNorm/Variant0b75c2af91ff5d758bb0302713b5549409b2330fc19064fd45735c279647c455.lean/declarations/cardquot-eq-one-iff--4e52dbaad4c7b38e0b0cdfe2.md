## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d571ce4a-04e5-8b6b-699b-fee4f9c891c5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cardQuot_eq_one_iff {P : Submodule R M} : cardQuot P = 1 ↔ P = ⊤ :=
  AddSubgroup.index_eq_one.trans (by simp [SetLike.ext_iff])

end

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/AbsNorm/Variant0b75c2af91ff5d758bb0302713b5549409b2330fc19064fd45735c279647c455.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/AbsNorm/Variant0b75c2af91ff5d758bb0302713b5549409b2330fc19064fd45735c279647c455.lean#L88).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
