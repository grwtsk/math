## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:40f2aeea-6c67-a5b8-64bd-4b922518d329`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 257–269.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma baseChange_addY'_of_baseChange (x₁ x₂ y₁ L : A) :
    (W.baseChange B).addY' (algebraMap A B x₁) (algebraMap A B x₂) (algebraMap A B y₁)
        (algebraMap A B L) =
      algebraMap A B ((W.baseChange A).addY' x₁ x₂ y₁ L) := by
  rw [← baseChange_addY', baseChange_baseChange]
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align weierstrass_curve.base_change_add_Y'_of_base_change WeierstrassCurve.baseChange_addY'_of_baseChange

/-- The $Y$-coordinate of the addition of two affine points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in `W`,
where the line through them is not vertical and has a slope of $L$.

This depends on `W`, and has argument order: $x_1$, $x_2$, $y_1$, $L$. -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Point/Variant3205093d013c1f9bb2ae64d25f5335c4ba6310ac23771293a961500903104376.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Point/Variant3205093d013c1f9bb2ae64d25f5335c4ba6310ac23771293a961500903104376.lean#L257).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e7b67734d608785a00d88534c3c239e7a79cd2f8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
