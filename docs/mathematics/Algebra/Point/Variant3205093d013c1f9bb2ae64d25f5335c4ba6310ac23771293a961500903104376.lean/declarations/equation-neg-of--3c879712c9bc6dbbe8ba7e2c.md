## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:55bcbe5d-cee1-72c0-043a-3cbde51910d8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 364–368.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma equation_neg_of (h : W.equation x₁ <| W.negY x₁ y₁) : W.equation x₁ y₁ :=
  equation_neg_iff.mp h
#align weierstrass_curve.equation_neg_of WeierstrassCurve.equation_neg_of

/-- The negation of an affine point in `W` lies in `W`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Point/Variant3205093d013c1f9bb2ae64d25f5335c4ba6310ac23771293a961500903104376.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Point/Variant3205093d013c1f9bb2ae64d25f5335c4ba6310ac23771293a961500903104376.lean#L364).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e7b67734d608785a00d88534c3c239e7a79cd2f8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
