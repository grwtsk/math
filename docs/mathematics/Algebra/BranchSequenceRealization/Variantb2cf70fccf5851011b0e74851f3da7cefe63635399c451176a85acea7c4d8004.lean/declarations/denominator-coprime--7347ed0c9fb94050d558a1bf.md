## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:45bddc69-3688-aa8e-ce64-cac1770dbd29`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 260–269.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem denominator_coprime (a : ℕ → ℕ) (n : ℕ) :
    Nat.Coprime (denominator a n) (denominator a (n + 1)) := by
  induction n with
  | zero => simp [denominator]
  | succ n ih =>
    rw [denominator, Nat.add_comm (a (n + 1) * denominator a (n + 1)) (denominator a n),
      Nat.coprime_add_mul_right_right]
    exact ih.symm

/-- Genuine denominators are nondecreasing, permitting only the initial tie. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/BranchSequenceRealization/Variantb2cf70fccf5851011b0e74851f3da7cefe63635399c451176a85acea7c4d8004.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/BranchSequenceRealization/Variantb2cf70fccf5851011b0e74851f3da7cefe63635399c451176a85acea7c4d8004.lean#L260).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b39d6cf29e119cfff1a261c954d91201d85c2137` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
