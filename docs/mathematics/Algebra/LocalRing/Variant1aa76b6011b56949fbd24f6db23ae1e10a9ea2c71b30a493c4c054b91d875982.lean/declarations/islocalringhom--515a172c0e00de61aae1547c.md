## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3f97971a7b11138be037b40c9861fa7e0209c2e02a4546bc3f3ae2f091c8ba6c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 205–213.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class IsLocalRingHom [Semiring R] [Semiring S] (f : R →+* S) : Prop where
  /-- A local ring homomorphism `f : R ⟶ S` will send nonunits of `R` to nonunits of `S`. -/
  map_nonunit : ∀ a, IsUnit (f a) → IsUnit a
#align is_local_ring_hom IsLocalRingHom

section

variable [Semiring R] [Semiring S] [Semiring T]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/LocalRing/Variant1aa76b6011b56949fbd24f6db23ae1e10a9ea2c71b30a493c4c054b91d875982.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LocalRing/Variant1aa76b6011b56949fbd24f6db23ae1e10a9ea2c71b30a493c4c054b91d875982.lean#L205).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `edc761e544ff194a9598b8528f634f2dcea429bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
