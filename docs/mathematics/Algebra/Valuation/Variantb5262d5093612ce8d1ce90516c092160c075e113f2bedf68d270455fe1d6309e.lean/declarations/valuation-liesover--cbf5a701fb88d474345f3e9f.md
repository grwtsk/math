## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c82293a5-939b-f67d-1466-55ce3c3534cf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 65–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem valuation_liesOver (x : K) :
    v.valuation K x ^ v.asIdeal.ramificationIdx' w.asIdeal =
      w.valuation L (algebraMap K L x) := by
  obtain ⟨x, y, hy, rfl⟩ := IsFractionRing.div_surjective (A := A) x
  simp [valuation_of_algebraMap, div_pow, ← IsScalarTower.algebraMap_apply A K L,
    IsScalarTower.algebraMap_apply A B L, intValuation_liesOver v w]

variable (K)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Valuation/Variantb5262d5093612ce8d1ce90516c092160c075e113f2bedf68d270455fe1d6309e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Valuation/Variantb5262d5093612ce8d1ce90516c092160c075e113f2bedf68d270455fe1d6309e.lean#L65).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c34d987e7ff26bb068231ff8e060341182d8c41a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
