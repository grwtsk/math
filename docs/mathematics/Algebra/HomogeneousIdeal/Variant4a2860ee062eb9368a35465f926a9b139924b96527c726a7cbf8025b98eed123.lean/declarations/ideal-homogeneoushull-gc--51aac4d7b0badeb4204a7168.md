## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f6247910-0e35-7783-bdd3-9edfb6fa42ea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 618–624.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Ideal.homogeneousHull.gc : GaloisConnection (Ideal.homogeneousHull 𝒜) toIdeal := fun _ J =>
  ⟨le_trans (Ideal.le_toIdeal_homogeneousHull _ _),
    fun H => J.homogeneousHull_toIdeal_eq_self ▸ Ideal.homogeneousHull_mono 𝒜 H⟩
#align ideal.homogeneous_hull.gc Ideal.homogeneousHull.gc

/-- `Ideal.homogeneousHull 𝒜` and `toIdeal : HomogeneousIdeal 𝒜 → Ideal A` form a galois
insertion. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/HomogeneousIdeal/Variant4a2860ee062eb9368a35465f926a9b139924b96527c726a7cbf8025b98eed123.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/HomogeneousIdeal/Variant4a2860ee062eb9368a35465f926a9b139924b96527c726a7cbf8025b98eed123.lean#L618).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b623dabee29246f945132bf825ca5dbcb6a693ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
