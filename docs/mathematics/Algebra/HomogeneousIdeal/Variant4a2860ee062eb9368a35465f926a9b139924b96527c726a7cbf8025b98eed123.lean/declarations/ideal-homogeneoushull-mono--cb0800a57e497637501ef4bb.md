## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:10c65c22-c575-b51f-08be-b2d1ac980fe7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 565–572.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Ideal.homogeneousHull_mono : Monotone (Ideal.homogeneousHull 𝒜) := fun I J I_le_J => by
  apply Ideal.span_mono
  rintro r ⟨hr1, ⟨x, hx⟩, rfl⟩
  refine' ⟨hr1, ⟨⟨x, I_le_J hx⟩, rfl⟩⟩
#align ideal.homogeneous_hull_mono Ideal.homogeneousHull_mono

variable {I 𝒜}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/HomogeneousIdeal/Variant4a2860ee062eb9368a35465f926a9b139924b96527c726a7cbf8025b98eed123.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/HomogeneousIdeal/Variant4a2860ee062eb9368a35465f926a9b139924b96527c726a7cbf8025b98eed123.lean#L565).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b623dabee29246f945132bf825ca5dbcb6a693ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
