## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7a9d94f5-22fc-3ee4-c374-80be3a5a17fa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 331–337.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Antivary.sum_smul_lt_sum_smul_comp_perm_iff (hfg : Antivary f g) :
    ∑ i, f i • g i < ∑ i, f i • g (σ i) ↔ ¬Antivary f (g ∘ σ) := by
  simp [(hfg.antivaryOn _).sum_smul_lt_sum_smul_comp_perm_iff fun _ _ ↦ mem_univ _]

/-- **Strict inequality case of the Rearrangement Inequality**: Pointwise scalar multiplication of
`f` and `g`, which antivary together, is strictly decreased by a permutation if and only if
`f ∘ σ` and `g` do not antivary together. Stated by permuting the entries of `f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Rearrangement/Variant8e4dabc9ce02b0fa51a6d39d969df88eae871a462d3af035d4792a52e6e36fae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Rearrangement/Variant8e4dabc9ce02b0fa51a6d39d969df88eae871a462d3af035d4792a52e6e36fae.lean#L331).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3304723ddbfd50f92976a5b4ba163534ba3cc337` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
