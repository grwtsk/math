## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:07aca669-fc89-d132-c860-e17974894f15`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 356–362.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem MonovaryOn.sum_mul_comp_perm_le_sum_mul (hfg : MonovaryOn f g s) (hσ : {x | σ x ≠ x} ⊆ s) :
    ∑ i ∈ s, f i * g (σ i) ≤ ∑ i ∈ s, f i * g i :=
  hfg.sum_smul_comp_perm_le_sum_smul hσ

/-- **Equality case of the Rearrangement Inequality**: Pointwise multiplication of `f` and `g`,
which monovary together on `s`, is unchanged by a permutation if and only if `f` and `g ∘ σ`
monovary together on `s`. Stated by permuting the entries of `g`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Rearrangement/Variant8e4dabc9ce02b0fa51a6d39d969df88eae871a462d3af035d4792a52e6e36fae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Rearrangement/Variant8e4dabc9ce02b0fa51a6d39d969df88eae871a462d3af035d4792a52e6e36fae.lean#L356).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3304723ddbfd50f92976a5b4ba163534ba3cc337` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
