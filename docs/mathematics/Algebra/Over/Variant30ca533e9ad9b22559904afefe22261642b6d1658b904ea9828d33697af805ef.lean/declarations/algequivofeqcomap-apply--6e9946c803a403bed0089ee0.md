## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c5700c08-35c2-abe7-c9e6-3d081e5bfb02`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 263–268.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem algEquivOfEqComap_apply (h : P = Q.comap σ) (x : B) : algEquivOfEqComap p σ h x = σ x :=
  rfl

end algEquiv

/-- If `P` lies over `p`, then the stabilizer of `P` acts on the extension `(B ⧸ P) / (A ⧸ p)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Over/Variant30ca533e9ad9b22559904afefe22261642b6d1658b904ea9828d33697af805ef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Over/Variant30ca533e9ad9b22559904afefe22261642b6d1658b904ea9828d33697af805ef.lean#L263).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a48eb66e5f6b6ee26a6428452e16cac8c64fcbaa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
