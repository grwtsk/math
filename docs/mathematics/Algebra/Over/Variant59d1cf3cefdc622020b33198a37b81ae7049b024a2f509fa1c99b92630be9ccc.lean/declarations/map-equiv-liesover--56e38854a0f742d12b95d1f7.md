## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6c5bcc78d9649df08234b681f7c51eb98d350e1afbcd8c5dd47782266311a838`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 183–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance map_equiv_liesOver [P.LiesOver p] {E : Type*} [EquivLike E B C] [AlgEquivClass E A B C]
    (σ : E) : (P.map σ).LiesOver p :=
  LiesOver.of_eq_map_equiv p σ rfl

end Semiring

section CommSemiring

variable {A : Type*} [CommSemiring A] {B : Type*} [CommSemiring B] {C : Type*} [Semiring C]
  [Algebra A B] [Algebra B C] [Algebra A C] [IsScalarTower A B C]
  (𝔓 : Ideal C) (P : Ideal B) (p : Ideal A)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Over/Variant59d1cf3cefdc622020b33198a37b81ae7049b024a2f509fa1c99b92630be9ccc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Over/Variant59d1cf3cefdc622020b33198a37b81ae7049b024a2f509fa1c99b92630be9ccc.lean#L183).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a12e9844cdd888c8d956f962b67609be51d6d2cf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
