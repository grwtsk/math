## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c011513b013cd20fab46d992b2ca027a4a36a52a0d96a5a3ba1d4b318934c804`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 183–189.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Quotient.tower_quotient_map_quotient [Algebra R S] :
    IsScalarTower R (R ⧸ p) (S ⧸ map (algebraMap R S) p) :=
  IsScalarTower.of_algebraMap_eq fun x => by
    rw [Quotient.algebraMap_eq, Quotient.algebraMap_quotient_map_quotient,
      Quotient.mk_algebraMap]
#align ideal.quotient.tower_quotient_map_quotient Ideal.Quotient.tower_quotient_map_quotient

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Over/Variant9fcbef051f0f97f3c7538f95a49b166a927bbf73e2da10f2bb57e6cf6b0fca81.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Over/Variant9fcbef051f0f97f3c7538f95a49b166a927bbf73e2da10f2bb57e6cf6b0fca81.lean#L183).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9eff4df97936422d010f723bf024f2a045de6dfc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
