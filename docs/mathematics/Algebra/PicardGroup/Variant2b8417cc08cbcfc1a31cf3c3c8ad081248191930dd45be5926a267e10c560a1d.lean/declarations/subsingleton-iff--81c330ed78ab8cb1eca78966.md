## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:13131029-7ca1-374a-b955-a6fb27083395`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 528–533.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem subsingleton_iffₛ : Subsingleton (Pic R) ↔
    ∀ (M : Type u) [AddCommMonoid M] [Module R M], Module.Invertible R M → Free R M :=
  .trans ⟨fun _ M _ _ _ ↦ Subsingleton.elim ..,
      fun h ↦ ⟨fun M N ↦ by rw [← mk_eq_self (M := M), ← mk_eq_self (M := N), h, h]⟩⟩ <|
    forall₄_congr fun _ _ _ _ ↦ mk_eq_one_iff_free

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/PicardGroup/Variant2b8417cc08cbcfc1a31cf3c3c8ad081248191930dd45be5926a267e10c560a1d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/PicardGroup/Variant2b8417cc08cbcfc1a31cf3c3c8ad081248191930dd45be5926a267e10c560a1d.lean#L528).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6b4966598f5e62181e195c60e1f0d3fd47894705` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
