## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:474453686fac17620afa14493c7a1141a86d3126684dbb4fbbc5c3ec2fe93dda`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 536–544.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [IsLocalRing R] : Subsingleton (Pic R) := subsingleton_iffₛ.mpr fun M _ _ _ ↦ by
  obtain ⟨S, hS⟩ := ((Invertible.linearEquiv R M).symm 1).exists_finset
  replace hS : 1 = ∑ i ∈ S, i.1 i.2 := by
    simpa [LinearEquiv.symm_apply_eq, Invertible.linearEquiv] using hS
  obtain ⟨⟨f, m⟩, mem, hfm⟩ := IsLocalRing.exists_of_isUnit_sum (hS ▸ isUnit_one)
  exact .of_equiv <| .symm <| .ofBijective f (Invertible.bijective_of_surjective <|
    LinearMap.range_eq_top.mp <| Ideal.eq_top_of_isUnit_mem _ ⟨m, rfl⟩ hfm)

/-- The Picard group of a semilocal ring is trivial. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/PicardGroup/Variant38ec259d29b3934e8e544a904e3036cec9e5a1fb3b22427b90db2aaa3d784ff1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/PicardGroup/Variant38ec259d29b3934e8e544a904e3036cec9e5a1fb3b22427b90db2aaa3d784ff1.lean#L536).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cb1fde9f0a17d9f5a18ceb0cb3b0f2cae433357d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
