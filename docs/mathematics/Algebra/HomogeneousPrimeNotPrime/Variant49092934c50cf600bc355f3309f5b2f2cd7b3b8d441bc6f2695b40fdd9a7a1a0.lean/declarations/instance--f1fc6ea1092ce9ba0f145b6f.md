## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:537ec950c723951e9869249b47536d6b82fdb32217a1f25fae9c013bc9d86555`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 148–158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : GradedAlgebra (grading R) where
  one_mem := grading.one_mem R
  mul_mem := grading.mul_mem R
  decompose' := grading.decompose
  left_inv := by convert grading.left_inv
  right_inv := by convert grading.right_inv

-- porting note: `I` upper case
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false

/-- The counterexample is the ideal `I = span {(2, 2)}`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/HomogeneousPrimeNotPrime/Variant49092934c50cf600bc355f3309f5b2f2cd7b3b8d441bc6f2695b40fdd9a7a1a0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/HomogeneousPrimeNotPrime/Variant49092934c50cf600bc355f3309f5b2f2cd7b3b8d441bc6f2695b40fdd9a7a1a0.lean#L148).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b00483a529a1dd1a56e609942771b3f25c5f5a05` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
