## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9cf7f484-1d18-2580-b84c-1994c1961f79`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 106–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem cancel_factors_ne {α} [Field α] {a b ad bd a' b' gcd : α} (ha : ad * a = a')
    (hb : bd * b = b') (had : ad ≠ 0) (hbd : bd ≠ 0) (hgcd : gcd ≠ 0) :
    (a ≠ b) = (1 / gcd * (bd * a') ≠ 1 / gcd * (ad * b')) := by

/-! ### Computing cancelation factors -/

/--
`findCancelFactor e` produces a natural number `n`, such that multiplying `e` by `n` will
be able to cancel all the numeric denominators in `e`. The returned `Tree` describes how to
distribute the value `n` over products inside `e`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/CancelDenoms/Variante4d046b0b8fc6a78afd1a6d446ea819168a17139b3ffdfa2e28fec7b7dac6650.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CancelDenoms/Variante4d046b0b8fc6a78afd1a6d446ea819168a17139b3ffdfa2e28fec7b7dac6650.lean#L106).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d5c4dd14d4394c4f6fc3ff7752bd8acb6ce2de2c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
