## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7879daffef1588e908b829d51c3424fa96d3a59ba9d869d238983ad38a9a5ca2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–47.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instField : Field ℚ where
  __ := commRing
  __ := commGroupWithZero
  nnqsmul := _
  nnqsmul_def := fun _ _ => rfl
  qsmul := _
  qsmul_def := fun _ _ => rfl
  nnratCast_def q := by
    rw [← NNRat.den_coe, ← Int.cast_natCast q.num, ← NNRat.num_coe]; exact(num_div_den _).symm
  ratCast_def _ := (num_div_den _).symm

### Extra instances to short-circuit type class resolution

These also prevent non-computable instances being used to construct these instances non-computably.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Rat/Variant9c2e9eb6cdffb951a90a4e9c296546cc13d94c8e986adae68a4d40879306286f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Rat/Variant9c2e9eb6cdffb951a90a4e9c296546cc13d94c8e986adae68a4d40879306286f.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9d2230cfe273a200f24864577d093fcf96d2d4c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
