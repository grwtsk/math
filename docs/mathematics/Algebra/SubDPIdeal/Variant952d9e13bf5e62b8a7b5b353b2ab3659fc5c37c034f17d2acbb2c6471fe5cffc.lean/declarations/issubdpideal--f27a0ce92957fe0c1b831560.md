## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8f3ca432c96c71824db93eea167521f5bd60bc7705455b0710ead4236ee2a088`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure IsSubDPIdeal {A : Type*} [CommSemiring A] {I : Ideal A} (hI : DividedPowers I)
    (J : Ideal A) : Prop where
  isSubideal : J ≤ I
  dpow_mem : ∀ (n : ℕ) (_ : n ≠ 0) {j : A} (_ : j ∈ J), hI.dpow n j ∈ J

section IsSubDPIdeal

namespace IsSubDPIdeal

variable {A : Type*} [CommSemiring A] {I : Ideal A} (hI : DividedPowers I)

open Ideal

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/SubDPIdeal/Variant952d9e13bf5e62b8a7b5b353b2ab3659fc5c37c034f17d2acbb2c6471fe5cffc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/SubDPIdeal/Variant952d9e13bf5e62b8a7b5b353b2ab3659fc5c37c034f17d2acbb2c6471fe5cffc.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d48853bce2d1873c7253498403051f12d1c18c37` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
