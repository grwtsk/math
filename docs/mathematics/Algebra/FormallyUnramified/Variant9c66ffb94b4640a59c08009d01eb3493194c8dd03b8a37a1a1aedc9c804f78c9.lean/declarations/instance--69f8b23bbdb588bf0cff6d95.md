## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0cb5a0b482ff369ecc93c7b3218e30a4a3c4a42bac967124d623452e05730ead`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 900) [IsOpenImmersion (pullback.diagonal f)] : FormallyUnramified f := by
  wlog hY : ∃ R, Y = Spec R
  · rw [IsLocalAtTarget.iff_of_openCover (P := @FormallyUnramified) Y.affineCover]
    intro i
    have inst : IsOpenImmersion (pullback.diagonal (pullback.snd f (Y.affineCover.map i))) :=
      MorphismProperty.pullback_snd (P := .diagonal @IsOpenImmersion) _ _ ‹_›
    exact this (pullback.snd _ _) ⟨_, rfl⟩
  obtain ⟨R, rfl⟩ := hY
  wlog hX : ∃ S, X = Spec S generalizing X
  · rw [IsLocalAtSource.iff_of_openCover (P := @FormallyUnramified) X.affineCover]
    intro i
    have inst : IsOpenImmersion (pullback.diagonal (X.affineCover.map i ≫ f)) :=
      MorphismProperty.comp_mem (.diagonal @IsOpenImmersion) _ _
        (inferInstanceAs (IsOpenImmersion _)) ‹_›
    exact this (_ ≫ _) ⟨_, rfl⟩
  obtain ⟨S, rfl⟩ := hX

  obtain ⟨x, rfl⟩ := Ideal.mem_span_singleton.mp (he'.le hx)

  rw [pow_two, Subtype.coe_mk, ← he, mul_assoc]
  exact Ideal.mul_mem_mul (he'.ge (Ideal.mem_span_singleton_self e)) hx

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/FormallyUnramified/Variant9c66ffb94b4640a59c08009d01eb3493194c8dd03b8a37a1a1aedc9c804f78c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/FormallyUnramified/Variant9c66ffb94b4640a59c08009d01eb3493194c8dd03b8a37a1a1aedc9c804f78c9.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `735e902ec9414103241ae7c2d6d728af499678aa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
