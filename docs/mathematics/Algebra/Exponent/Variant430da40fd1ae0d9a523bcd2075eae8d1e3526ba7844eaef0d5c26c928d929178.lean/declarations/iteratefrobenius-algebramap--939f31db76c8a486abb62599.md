## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3e5f1c84-ca44-2a1e-2259-4b3998c98941`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 303–316.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iterateFrobenius_algebraMap {n : ℕ} (hn : exponent K L ≤ n) (a : K) :
    iterateFrobenius K L p hn (algebraMap K L a) = a ^ p ^ n := by
  apply (algebraMap K L).injective
  rw [map_pow, algebraMap_iterateFrobenius K p hn]

end RingHom

variable [Field F] [Algebra F K] [Algebra F L] [IsScalarTower F K L]
variable [ExpChar F p]

/-- Version of `iterateFrobenius` as a semilinear map over a subfield `F` of `K`, wrt the
iterated Frobenius homomorphism on `F`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Exponent/Variant430da40fd1ae0d9a523bcd2075eae8d1e3526ba7844eaef0d5c26c928d929178.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Exponent/Variant430da40fd1ae0d9a523bcd2075eae8d1e3526ba7844eaef0d5c26c928d929178.lean#L303).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
