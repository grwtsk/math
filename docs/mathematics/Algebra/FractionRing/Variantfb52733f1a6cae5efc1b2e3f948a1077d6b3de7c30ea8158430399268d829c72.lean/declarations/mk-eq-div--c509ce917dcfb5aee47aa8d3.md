## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7f9a126c-5eff-8b8b-4de7-85abbf376aa5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 521–532.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mk_eq_div {r s} :
    (Localization.mk r s : FractionRing A) =
      (algebraMap _ _ r / algebraMap A _ s : FractionRing A) := by
  rw [Localization.mk_eq_mk', IsFractionRing.mk'_eq_div]

section liftAlgebra

variable [Field K] [Algebra R K] [FaithfulSMul R K]

/-- This is not an instance because it creates a diamond when `K = FractionRing R`.
Should usually be introduced locally along with `isScalarTower_liftAlgebra`
See note [reducible non-instances]. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/FractionRing/Variantfb52733f1a6cae5efc1b2e3f948a1077d6b3de7c30ea8158430399268d829c72.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/FractionRing/Variantfb52733f1a6cae5efc1b2e3f948a1077d6b3de7c30ea8158430399268d829c72.lean#L521).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `29c65eee57715228326981f87ce8633e774e94c2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
