## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cfc72a7a-fefd-46e9-77d6-d910f9b1c395`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 302–308.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lift_mk' (hg : Injective g) (x) (y : nonZeroDivisors A) :
    lift hg (mk' K x y) = g x / g y := by simp only [mk'_eq_div, map_div₀, lift_algebraMap]

/-- Given commutative rings `A, B` where `B` is an integral domain, with fraction rings `K`, `L`
and an injective ring hom `j : A →+* B`, we get a ring hom
sending `z : K` to `g (j x) * (g (j y))⁻¹`, where `(x, y) : A × (NonZeroDivisors A)` are
such that `z = f x * (f y)⁻¹`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/FractionRing/Variant5d36df64675edc6825c1195d08bd266b44d6667f9d435326d8e15b7275bdf83c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/FractionRing/Variant5d36df64675edc6825c1195d08bd266b44d6667f9d435326d8e15b7275bdf83c.lean#L302).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7bfae6bbb41fd2c98a31988c8b3a1be32dac730` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
