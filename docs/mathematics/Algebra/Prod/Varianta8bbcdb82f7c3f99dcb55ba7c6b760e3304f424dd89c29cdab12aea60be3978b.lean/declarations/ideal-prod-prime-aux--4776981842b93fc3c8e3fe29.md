## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fdbb501c-33e7-a37c-9cb0-cd4db91384a9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–195.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ideal_prod_prime_aux {I : Ideal R} {J : Ideal S} :
    (Ideal.prod I J).IsPrime → I = ⊤ ∨ J = ⊤ := by
  contrapose!
  simp only [ne_top_iff_one, isPrime_iff, not_and, not_forall, not_or]
  exact fun ⟨hI, hJ⟩ _ => ⟨⟨0, 1⟩, ⟨1, 0⟩, by simp, by simp [hJ], by simp [hI]⟩

/-- Classification of prime ideals in product rings: the prime ideals of `R × S` are precisely the
    ideals of the form `p × S` or `R × p`, where `p` is a prime ideal of `R` or `S`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Prod/Varianta8bbcdb82f7c3f99dcb55ba7c6b760e3304f424dd89c29cdab12aea60be3978b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Prod/Varianta8bbcdb82f7c3f99dcb55ba7c6b760e3304f424dd89c29cdab12aea60be3978b.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f6160c348cc2e61ae859eb4f94127e0966526c9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
