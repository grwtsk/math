## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8d3be1ed1a7a167df9be7e1baa07a7a58d8ae7d6f048ddd78b387f46ebd4fadb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 96–107.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def mkOrderedRingInst? (u : Level) (type : Expr) (semiringInst? leInst? ltInst? preorderInst? : Option Expr) : GoalM (Option Expr) := do
  let some semiringInst := semiringInst? | return none
  let some leInst := leInst? | return none
  let some ltInst := ltInst? | return none
  let some preorderInst := preorderInst? | return none
  let isOrdType := mkApp5 (mkConst ``Grind.OrderedRing [u]) type semiringInst leInst ltInst preorderInst
  let some inst ← synthInstance? isOrdType
    | -- TODO: this issue message should explain which behaviours are disabled when then ordered ring instance is not available.
      reportIssue! "type has a `Preorder` and is a `Semiring`, but is not an ordered ring, failed to synthesize{indentExpr isOrdType}"
      return none
  return some inst

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/StructId/Variant23e7e0b0e319952acd16bd6722088e12fe173abe0350c34a3c847af48904c57f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/StructId/Variant23e7e0b0e319952acd16bd6722088e12fe173abe0350c34a3c847af48904c57f.lean#L96).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `74fb054106fbb409e5a283857a1079db0381f813` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
