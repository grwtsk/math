## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a33eb077f1a08328896816ed0948ab4a2f8b690b934426dcf8f0147b6cffb968`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 150–158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def ensureToHomoFieldDefEq (parentInst : Expr) (inst : Expr) (toFieldName : Name) (toHeteroName : Name) (u : Level) (type : Expr)
    (extraType? : Option Expr := none) : GoalM Unit := do
  let toField := mkApp2 (mkConst toFieldName [u]) type inst
  let heteroToField :=
    match extraType? with
    | none => mkApp2 (mkConst toHeteroName [u]) type toField
    | some extraType => mkApp3 (mkConst toHeteroName [0, u]) extraType type toField
  ensureDefEq parentInst heteroToField

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/StructId/Variant90debd5849c52e5751b8ed29beb82560f1b0b56761d8c0159e5ae3cba7f74f3e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/StructId/Variant90debd5849c52e5751b8ed29beb82560f1b0b56761d8c0159e5ae3cba7f74f3e.lean#L150).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a5d963c3243fe2f7dec54707fbc075223fd67bd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
