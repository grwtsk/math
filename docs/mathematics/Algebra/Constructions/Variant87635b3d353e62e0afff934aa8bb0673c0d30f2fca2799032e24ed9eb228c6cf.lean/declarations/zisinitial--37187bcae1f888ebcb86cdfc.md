## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:641bb79c74e24d8002f8fb90ae61c36dff8d22ac05850744bb7276beb6c36ca5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 176–188.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def zIsInitial : IsInitial (CommRingCat.of ℤ) :=
  IsInitial.ofUnique (h := fun R => ⟨⟨Int.castRingHom R⟩, fun a => a.ext_int _⟩)
set_option linter.uppercaseLean3 false in
#align CommRing.Z_is_initial CommRingCat.zIsInitial

end Terminal

section Product

variable (A B : CommRingCat.{u})

/-- The product in `CommRingCat` is the cartesian product. This is the binary fan. -/
@[simps! pt]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Constructions/Variant87635b3d353e62e0afff934aa8bb0673c0d30f2fca2799032e24ed9eb228c6cf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Constructions/Variant87635b3d353e62e0afff934aa8bb0673c0d30f2fca2799032e24ed9eb228c6cf.lean#L176).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bfc70abc933b035a68c19f0c3a826921e3c3ec1f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
