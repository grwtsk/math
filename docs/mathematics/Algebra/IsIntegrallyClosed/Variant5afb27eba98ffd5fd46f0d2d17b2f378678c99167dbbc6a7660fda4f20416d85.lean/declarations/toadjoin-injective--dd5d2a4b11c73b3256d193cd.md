## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f40db616-4967-caa0-2bc0-3e7642c4b6c9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 165–177.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  refine' (injective_iff_map_eq_zero _).2 fun P₁ hP₁ => _
  obtain ⟨P, hP⟩ := mk_surjective (minpoly.monic hx) P₁
  by_cases hPzero : P = 0
  · simpa [hPzero] using hP.symm

    isIntegrallyClosed_dvd_iff hx] at hP₁
  obtain ⟨Q, hQ⟩ := hP₁
  rw [← hP, hQ, RingHom.map_mul, mk_self, zero_mul]
#align minpoly.to_adjoin.injective minpoly.ToAdjoin.injective

@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/IsIntegrallyClosed/Variant5afb27eba98ffd5fd46f0d2d17b2f378678c99167dbbc6a7660fda4f20416d85.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/IsIntegrallyClosed/Variant5afb27eba98ffd5fd46f0d2d17b2f378678c99167dbbc6a7660fda4f20416d85.lean#L165).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `73355f0866bc13bb7e86dce47396c28e7aa443fc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
