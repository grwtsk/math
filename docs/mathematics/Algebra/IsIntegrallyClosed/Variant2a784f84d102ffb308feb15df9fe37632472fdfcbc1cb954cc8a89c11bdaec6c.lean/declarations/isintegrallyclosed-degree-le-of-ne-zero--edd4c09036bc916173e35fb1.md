## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:927e7849-9598-363c-6a06-c8041a10d028`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 112–121.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsIntegrallyClosed.degree_le_of_ne_zero {s : S} (hs : IsIntegral R s) {p : R[X]}
    (hp0 : p ≠ 0) (hp : Polynomial.aeval s p = 0) : degree (minpoly R s) ≤ degree p := by
  rw [degree_eq_natDegree (minpoly.ne_zero hs), degree_eq_natDegree hp0]
  norm_cast
  exact natDegree_le_of_dvd ((isIntegrallyClosed_dvd_iff hs _).mp hp) hp0

/-- The minimal polynomial of an element `x` is uniquely characterized by its defining property:
if there is another monic polynomial of minimal degree that has `x` as a root, then this polynomial
is equal to the minimal polynomial of `x`. See also `minpoly.unique` which relaxes the
assumptions on `S` in exchange for stronger assumptions on `R`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/IsIntegrallyClosed/Variant2a784f84d102ffb308feb15df9fe37632472fdfcbc1cb954cc8a89c11bdaec6c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/IsIntegrallyClosed/Variant2a784f84d102ffb308feb15df9fe37632472fdfcbc1cb954cc8a89c11bdaec6c.lean#L112).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e834dfcf4a8161c2c8739ea75d1380c7e852d421` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
