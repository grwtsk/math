## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5de4d6142da39b44d3dc81aa2c4905b52aaa509e2c4d389899e05666f59ebfa4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def frobeniusPolyAux : ℕ → MvPolynomial ℕ ℤ
  | n => X (n + 1) -  ∑ i : Fin n, have _ := i.is_lt
      ∑ j ∈ range (p ^ (n - i)),
        (((X (i : ℕ) ^ p) ^ (p ^ (n - (i : ℕ)) - (j + 1)) : MvPolynomial ℕ ℤ) *
        (frobeniusPolyAux i) ^ (j + 1)) *
        C (((p ^ (n - i)).choose (j + 1) / (p ^ (n - i - v p (j + 1)))
          * ↑p ^ (j - v p (j + 1)) : ℕ) : ℤ)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Frobenius/Variant36a8fd31f56d5b6d2128f0b4e126e2384e71564e9ece74e111a453f77050b046.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Frobenius/Variant36a8fd31f56d5b6d2128f0b4e126e2384e71564e9ece74e111a453f77050b046.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5bed5da511efc1999d14296113feb905bf8692c5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
