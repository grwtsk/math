## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f154cb30-b5aa-15d2-7ddd-9fb361a28b80`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 222–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ghostComponent_frobeniusFun (n : ℕ) (x : 𝕎 R) :
    ghostComponent n (frobeniusFun x) = ghostComponent (n + 1) x := by
  simp only [ghostComponent_apply, frobeniusFun, coeff_mk, ← bind₁_frobeniusPoly_wittPolynomial,
    aeval_bind₁]

/-- If `R` has characteristic `p`, then there is a ring endomorphism
that raises `r : R` to the power `p`.
By applying `WittVector.map` to this endomorphism,
we obtain a ring endomorphism `frobenius R p : 𝕎 R →+* 𝕎 R`.

The underlying function of this morphism is `WittVector.frobeniusFun`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Frobenius/Variante4a4578e5189dd2046e711dcbf9bddbbb786d9f5b621e808e9ea455b03298564.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Frobenius/Variante4a4578e5189dd2046e711dcbf9bddbbb786d9f5b621e808e9ea455b03298564.lean#L222).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0b5a6dfeb91d52bca4316737d654e4d069a5bf4a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
