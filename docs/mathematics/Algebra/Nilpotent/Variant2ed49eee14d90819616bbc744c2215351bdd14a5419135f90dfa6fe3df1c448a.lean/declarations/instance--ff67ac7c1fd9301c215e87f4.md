## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1c701dd8c86dce710d802e65fc6b6faaca29424e5840557447518042e47efc5b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 543–558.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) LieAlgebra.isSolvable_of_isNilpotent (R : Type u) (L : Type v)
    [CommRing R] [LieRing L] [LieAlgebra R L] [hL : LieModule.IsNilpotent R L L] :
    LieAlgebra.IsSolvable R L := by
  obtain ⟨k, h⟩ : ∃ k, LieModule.lowerCentralSeries R L L k = ⊥ := hL.nilpotent
  use k; rw [← le_bot_iff] at h ⊢
  exact le_trans (LieModule.derivedSeries_le_lowerCentralSeries R L k) h
#align lie_algebra.is_solvable_of_is_nilpotent LieAlgebra.isSolvable_of_isNilpotent

variable (R : Type u) (L : Type v) (L' : Type w)

variable [CommRing R] [LieRing L] [LieAlgebra R L] [LieRing L'] [LieAlgebra R L']

/-- We say a Lie algebra is nilpotent when it is nilpotent as a Lie module over itself via the
adjoint representation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Nilpotent/Variant2ed49eee14d90819616bbc744c2215351bdd14a5419135f90dfa6fe3df1c448a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Nilpotent/Variant2ed49eee14d90819616bbc744c2215351bdd14a5419135f90dfa6fe3df1c448a.lean#L543).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `903cabcddff318835fea2b50dbc0fd6e51f1bdfc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
