## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:140296944cf8a993446740d4e7e1db011288f225176a7b3f05ca3cf9557a45e2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 879–897.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [h : LieRing.IsNilpotent L] : LieRing.IsNilpotent (⊤ : LieSubalgebra R L) :=
  LieSubalgebra.topEquiv.nilpotent_iff_equiv_nilpotent.mpr h

end NilpotentAlgebras

namespace LieIdeal

open LieModule

variable {R L : Type*} [CommRing R] [LieRing L] [LieAlgebra R L] (I : LieIdeal R L)
variable (M : Type*) [AddCommGroup M] [Module R M] [LieRingModule L M]
variable (k : ℕ)

/-- Given a Lie module `M` over a Lie algebra `L` together with an ideal `I` of `L`, this is the
lower central series of `M` as an `I`-module. The advantage of using this definition instead of
`LieModule.lowerCentralSeries R I M` is that its terms are Lie submodules of `M` as an
`L`-module, rather than just as an `I`-module.

See also `LieIdeal.coe_lcs_eq`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Nilpotent/Variantb2d99a51ef56b2aec4d1cfeec521490b6a9177c7f967eb0ff2bc9f75600c7974.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Nilpotent/Variantb2d99a51ef56b2aec4d1cfeec521490b6a9177c7f967eb0ff2bc9f75600c7974.lean#L879).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dd6c1d057d91360eaf898e07cbc816d98dd8c2bd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
