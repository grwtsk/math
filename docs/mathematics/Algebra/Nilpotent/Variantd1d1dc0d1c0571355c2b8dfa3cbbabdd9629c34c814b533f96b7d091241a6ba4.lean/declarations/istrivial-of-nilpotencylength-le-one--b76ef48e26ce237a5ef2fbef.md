## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4b551971-2f6e-aed4-77b8-0b5c721e37e6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 439–452.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isTrivial_of_nilpotencyLength_le_one [IsNilpotent L M] (h : nilpotencyLength L M ≤ 1) :
    IsTrivial L M := by
  nontriviality M
  rcases Nat.le_one_iff_eq_zero_or_eq_one.mp h with h | h
  · rw [nilpotencyLength_eq_zero_iff] at h; infer_instance
  · rwa [nilpotencyLength_eq_one_iff] at h

end

/-- Given a non-trivial nilpotent Lie module `M` with lower central series
`M = C₀ ≥ C₁ ≥ ⋯ ≥ Cₖ = ⊥`, this is the `k-1`th term in the lower central series (the last
non-trivial term).

For a trivial or non-nilpotent module, this is the bottom submodule, `⊥`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Nilpotent/Variantd1d1dc0d1c0571355c2b8dfa3cbbabdd9629c34c814b533f96b7d091241a6ba4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Nilpotent/Variantd1d1dc0d1c0571355c2b8dfa3cbbabdd9629c34c814b533f96b7d091241a6ba4.lean#L439).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2fc68f517c627a1147a0ffbf63bfc3e3481da8d5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
