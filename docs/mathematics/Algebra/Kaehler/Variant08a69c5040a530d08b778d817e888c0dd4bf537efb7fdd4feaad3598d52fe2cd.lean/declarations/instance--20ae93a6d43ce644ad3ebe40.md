## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bbce467e507d906401a0a265c0b15066b3c00057d8df578a7a591b85349efe20`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 448–456.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Module.Projective P (Ω[P⁄R]) :=
  (Algebra.FormallySmooth.iff_injective_and_projective'.mp ‹_›).2

include hf in
/--
Given a formally smooth `R`-algebra `P` and a surjective algebra homomorphism `f : P →ₐ[R] S`
with kernel `I` (typically a presentation `R[X] → S`),
then `S` is formally smooth iff `I/I² → S ⊗[P] Ω[P⁄R]` is injective and `Ω[S/R]` is projective.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Kaehler/Variant08a69c5040a530d08b778d817e888c0dd4bf537efb7fdd4feaad3598d52fe2cd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Kaehler/Variant08a69c5040a530d08b778d817e888c0dd4bf537efb7fdd4feaad3598d52fe2cd.lean#L448).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8496d5bf06be1bc55372ba850642e28cd2a8607f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
