## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7f41fe8b1df04bf19324e3f7fa2a94008005e29633372f0e41cc58ba2f529e65`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 127–140.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance AddGroup.intSMulWithZero [AddGroup M] : SMulWithZero ℤ M where
  smul_zero := zsmul_zero
  zero_smul := zero_zsmul
#align add_group.int_smul_with_zero AddGroup.intSMulWithZero

section MonoidWithZero

variable [MonoidWithZero R] [MonoidWithZero R'] [Zero M]

variable (R M)

/-- An action of a monoid with zero `R` on a Type `M`, also with `0`, extends `MulAction` and
is compatible with `0` (both in `R` and in `M`), with `1 ∈ R`, and with associativity of
multiplication on the monoid `M`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/SMulWithZero/Variantb8d654f4802f3aa8a150df6ef5fa15c61c7517175af9603e17960feba47b3103.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/SMulWithZero/Variantb8d654f4802f3aa8a150df6ef5fa15c61c7517175af9603e17960feba47b3103.lean#L127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e02df180a9118837e67f31eae886909c6a88ecba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
