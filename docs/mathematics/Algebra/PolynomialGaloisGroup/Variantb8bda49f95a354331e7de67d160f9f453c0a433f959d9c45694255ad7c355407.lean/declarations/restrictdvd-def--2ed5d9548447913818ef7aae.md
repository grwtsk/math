## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:faa84bbf-f4e3-da93-8eca-60092604f40a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 245–252.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem restrictDvd_def [Decidable (q = 0)] (hpq : p ∣ q) :
    restrictDvd hpq =
      if hq : q = 0 then 1
      else @restrict F _ p _ _ _
        ⟨(SplittingField.splits q).of_dvd (map_ne_zero hq) ((map_dvd_map' _).mpr hpq)⟩ := by
  unfold restrictDvd
  congr

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/PolynomialGaloisGroup/Variantb8bda49f95a354331e7de67d160f9f453c0a433f959d9c45694255ad7c355407.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/PolynomialGaloisGroup/Variantb8bda49f95a354331e7de67d160f9f453c0a433f959d9c45694255ad7c355407.lean#L245).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a6bcebab1ecaf07d349bf936ed646ea367e57c19` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
