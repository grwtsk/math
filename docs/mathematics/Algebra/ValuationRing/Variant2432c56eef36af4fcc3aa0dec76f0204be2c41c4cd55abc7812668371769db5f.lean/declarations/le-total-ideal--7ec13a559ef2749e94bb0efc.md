## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:763c45a1ab0c8d14575045ab21608cd8387c92f95c0aa93a782e4b74b13bd566`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 281–298.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance le_total_ideal : @Std.Total (Ideal A) (· ≤ ·) := by
  constructor; intro α β
  by_cases! h : ∀ x : A, x ∈ α → x ∈ β
  · exact Or.inl h
  obtain ⟨a, h₁, h₂⟩ := h
  right
  intro b hb
  obtain ⟨c, h | h⟩ := PreValuationRing.cond a b
  · rw [← h]
    exact Ideal.mul_mem_right _ _ h₁
  · exfalso; apply h₂; rw [← h]
    apply Ideal.mul_mem_right _ _ hb

/- Todo: get rid of the `DecidableLE` argument.
Currently, this argument causes this instance to not be called often,
which hides a loop in simp-lemmas. See
https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/287929-mathlib4/topic/conflicting.20simp-normal.20form.3A.20bot.20vs.200/with/566807522 -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/ValuationRing/Variant2432c56eef36af4fcc3aa0dec76f0204be2c41c4cd55abc7812668371769db5f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/ValuationRing/Variant2432c56eef36af4fcc3aa0dec76f0204be2c41c4cd55abc7812668371769db5f.lean#L281).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f6a788bf200f4db0f407866e996b30e08b0eab68` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
