## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a74ad3fda3fb8f032ac2eaff4a929c75ae35aed79546325319b30b745c263c0b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 254–263.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Add (CentroidHom α) :=
  ⟨fun f g ↦
    { (f + g : α →+ α) with
      map_mul_left' := fun a b ↦ by
        show f (a * b) + g (a * b) = a * (f b + g b)
        simp [map_mul_left, mul_add]
      map_mul_right' := fun a b ↦ by
        show f (a * b) + g (a * b) = (f a + g a) * b
        simp [map_mul_right, add_mul] }⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Centroid/Variantd0dffa38abfc5504daea86f1311322e66ee872118e9e50c879e0c3dcbbbf9951.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Centroid/Variantd0dffa38abfc5504daea86f1311322e66ee872118e9e50c879e0c3dcbbbf9951.lean#L254).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7ad17068d19af5520603dd1a3d5d77974f1a65e4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
