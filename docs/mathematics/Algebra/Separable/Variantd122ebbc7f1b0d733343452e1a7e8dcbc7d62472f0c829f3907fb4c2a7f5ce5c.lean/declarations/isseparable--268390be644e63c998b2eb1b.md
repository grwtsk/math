## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6c3182cce3c1d109fddda011d4528f1d11f048edd4cce2eb667d450ebbf99b83`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 547–556.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IsSeparable (x : K) : Prop := Polynomial.Separable (minpoly F x)

/-- Typeclass for separable field extension: `K` is a separable field extension of `F` iff
the minimal polynomial of every `x : K` is separable. This implies that `K/F` is an algebraic
extension, because the minimal polynomial of a non-integral element is `0`, which is not
separable.

We define this for general (commutative) rings and only assume `F` and `K` are fields if this
is needed for a proof. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Separable/Variantd122ebbc7f1b0d733343452e1a7e8dcbc7d62472f0c829f3907fb4c2a7f5ce5c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Separable/Variantd122ebbc7f1b0d733343452e1a7e8dcbc7d62472f0c829f3907fb4c2a7f5ce5c.lean#L547).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bea99b75a7a74dfd1384b24093c889e4b8ff43b9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
