## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8d685e8e-73a1-29c9-6829-d59376fa1763`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 518–546.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

-- TODO: refactor to allow transcendental extensions?
-- See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_extension#Separability_of_transcendental_extensions
-- Note that right now a Galois extension (class `IsGalois`) is defined to be an extension which
-- is separable and normal, so if the definition of separable changes here at some point
-- to allow non-algebraic extensions, then the definition of `IsGalois` must also be changed.

variable {K} in
/--
An element `x` of an algebra `K` over a commutative ring `F` is said to be *separable*, if its
minimal polynomial over `K` is separable. Note that the minimal polynomial of any element not
integral over `F` is defined to be `0`, which is not a separable polynomial.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Separable/Variantd122ebbc7f1b0d733343452e1a7e8dcbc7d62472f0c829f3907fb4c2a7f5ce5c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Separable/Variantd122ebbc7f1b0d733343452e1a7e8dcbc7d62472f0c829f3907fb4c2a7f5ce5c.lean#L518).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
