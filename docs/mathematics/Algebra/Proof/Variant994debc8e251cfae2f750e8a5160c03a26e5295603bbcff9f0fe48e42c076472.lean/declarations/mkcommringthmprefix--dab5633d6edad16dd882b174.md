## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:327cf251acd7f8f447ae7023d3c0c8ae9152c50e878eadfa85d9da4a0c78b952`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 221–228.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def mkCommRingThmPrefix (declName : Name) : ProofM Expr := do
  let s ← getStruct
  return mkApp3 (mkConst declName [s.u]) s.type (← getCommRingInst) (← getRingContext)

/--
Returns the prefix of a theorem with name `declName` where the first four arguments are
`{α} [CommRing α] [NoNatZeroDivisors α] (rctx : Context α)`
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Proof/Variant994debc8e251cfae2f750e8a5160c03a26e5295603bbcff9f0fe48e42c076472.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Proof/Variant994debc8e251cfae2f750e8a5160c03a26e5295603bbcff9f0fe48e42c076472.lean#L221).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `09b069e22dfcacb3208604738b57eeb6bd44578b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
