## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:454c9441-6219-c1e9-5ac8-85285886ae00`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 71–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma surjectiveOnStalks_iff_forall_ideal :
    f.SurjectiveOnStalks ↔
      ∀ I : Ideal S, I ≠ ⊤ → ∀ s : S, ∃ x r : R, ∃ c ∉ I, f r ∉ I ∧ c * f r * s = c * f x := by
  simp_rw [SurjectiveOnStalks, surjective_localRingHom_iff]
  refine ⟨fun H I hI s ↦ ?_, fun H I hI ↦ H I hI.ne_top⟩
  obtain ⟨M, hM, hIM⟩ := I.exists_le_maximal hI
  obtain ⟨x, r, c, hc, hr, e⟩ := H M hM.isPrime s
  exact ⟨x, r, c, fun h ↦ hc (hIM h), fun h ↦ hr (hIM h), e⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/SurjectiveOnStalks/Variantedf80480a298f69be52c5151d31f56b4846d7bc7e69933c0c87df8963a22f760.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/SurjectiveOnStalks/Variantedf80480a298f69be52c5151d31f56b4846d7bc7e69933c0c87df8963a22f760.lean#L71).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a52cb1e1a4d7623a21c0012066e90a700a03e934` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
