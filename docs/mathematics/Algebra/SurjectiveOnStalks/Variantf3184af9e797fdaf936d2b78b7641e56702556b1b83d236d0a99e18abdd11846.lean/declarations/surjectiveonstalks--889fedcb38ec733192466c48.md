## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0b4a787663ea4ffac443e26cb73725cc3346f0bc02cfdd5dbf6443518c99e98c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 35–42.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def SurjectiveOnStalks (f : R →+* S) : Prop :=
  ∀ (P : Ideal S) (_ : P.IsPrime), Function.Surjective (Localization.localRingHom _ P f rfl)

/--
`R_p →+* S_q` is surjective if and only if
every `x : S` is of the form `f x / f r` for some `f r ∉ q`.
This is useful when proving `SurjectiveOnStalks`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/SurjectiveOnStalks/Variantf3184af9e797fdaf936d2b78b7641e56702556b1b83d236d0a99e18abdd11846.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/SurjectiveOnStalks/Variantf3184af9e797fdaf936d2b78b7641e56702556b1b83d236d0a99e18abdd11846.lean#L35).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dd14de14123cbc177410b4aa595cda5031d74060` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
