## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9bd8da10-383c-5e8d-05cb-a01886f1a24f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–67.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Cotangent.surjective_map_ofComp :
    Function.Surjective (Extension.Cotangent.map (Q.ofComp P).toExtensionHom) := by
  intro x
  obtain ⟨⟨x, hx⟩, rfl⟩ := Extension.Cotangent.mk_surjective x
  have : x ∈ Q.ker := hx
  rw [← map_ofComp_ker Q P, Ideal.mem_map_iff_of_surjective
    _ (toAlgHom_ofComp_surjective Q P)] at this
  obtain ⟨x, hx', rfl⟩ := this
  exact ⟨.mk ⟨x, hx'⟩, Extension.Cotangent.map_mk _ _⟩

/-!
Given representations `0 → I → R[X] → S → 0` and `0 → K → S[Y] → T → 0`,
we may consider the induced representation `0 → J → R[X, Y] → T → 0`, and the sequence
`T ⊗[S] (I/I²) → J/J² → K/K²` is exact.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/JacobiZariski/Variant15fb7ea41c5a775a9e5c3499c2e6ddbf274435a28072c45f2f23e881d3b19a43.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/JacobiZariski/Variant15fb7ea41c5a775a9e5c3499c2e6ddbf274435a28072c45f2f23e881d3b19a43.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `769f0651401d0624885f2ff0a06ea91eff4028b2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
