## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4b1ee028e193c12b5f573eefa14e5a2f72b5f83f39344362b14c70bef6e137a8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 42–47.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance hasSMul' : SMul (Ideal R) (Submodule R M) :=
  ⟨Submodule.map₂ (LinearMap.lsmul R M)⟩
#align submodule.has_smul' Submodule.hasSMul'

/-- This duplicates the global `smul_eq_mul`, but doesn't have to unfold anywhere near as much to
apply. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Operations/Variant7206fcc1eae5431667792c0e54aff70d5bdc7c0bd0d9eaf89e21fc036fc53eec.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Operations/Variant7206fcc1eae5431667792c0e54aff70d5bdc7c0bd0d9eaf89e21fc036fc53eec.lean#L42).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d93bb8daa13aa4395647185dd4aa01fbafca6654` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
