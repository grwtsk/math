## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:799f8e74-73e2-af8b-7feb-377a0198ff38`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 654–660.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem finset_inf_span_singleton {ι : Type*} (s : Finset ι) (I : ι → R)
    (hI : Set.Pairwise (↑s) (IsCoprime on I)) :
    (s.inf fun i => Ideal.span ({I i} : Set R)) = Ideal.span {∏ i ∈ s, I i} := by
  ext x
  simp only [Submodule.mem_finsetInf, Ideal.mem_span_singleton]
  exact ⟨Finset.prod_dvd_of_coprime hI, fun h i hi => (Finset.dvd_prod_of_mem _ hi).trans h⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Operations/Variant23283fefd1426fc3568256171d06a7a90286fd9d3bd8830d80e5a778c1b82400.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Operations/Variant23283fefd1426fc3568256171d06a7a90286fd9d3bd8830d80e5a778c1b82400.lean#L654).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `029b70b0cfa6f8db77caa7e1f285af4ede9276d0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
