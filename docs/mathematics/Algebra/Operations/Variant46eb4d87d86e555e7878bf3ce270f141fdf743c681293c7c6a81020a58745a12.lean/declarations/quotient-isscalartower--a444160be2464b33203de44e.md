## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2157ac5a707de91bcd2bc5c24f53284afcfe22e9b9cf11d017d8c6aa036bc52a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 350–354.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Quotient.isScalarTower [SMul R₁ R₂] [IsScalarTower R₁ R₂ A] (I : Ideal A) :
    IsScalarTower R₁ R₂ (A ⧸ I) := inferInstance

/-- The canonical morphism `A →ₐ[R₁] A ⧸ I` as morphism of `R₁`-algebras, for `I` an ideal of
`A`, where `A` is an `R₁`-algebra. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Operations/Variant46eb4d87d86e555e7878bf3ce270f141fdf743c681293c7c6a81020a58745a12.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Operations/Variant46eb4d87d86e555e7878bf3ce270f141fdf743c681293c7c6a81020a58745a12.lean#L350).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c103efaa582c7a17045232e2bd5f056e0a0b5f42` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
