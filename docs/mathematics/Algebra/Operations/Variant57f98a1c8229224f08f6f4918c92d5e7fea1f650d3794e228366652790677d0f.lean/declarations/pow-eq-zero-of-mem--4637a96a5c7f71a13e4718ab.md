## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d2ff1ac4-3e41-a0a1-2c3b-c8201e5347ff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 382–392.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pow_eq_zero_of_mem {I : Ideal R} {n m : ℕ} (hnI : I ^ n = 0) (hmn : n ≤ m) {x : R}
    (hx : x ∈ I) : x ^ m = 0 := by
  simpa [hnI] using pow_le_pow_right hmn <| pow_mem_pow hx m

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Operations/Variant57f98a1c8229224f08f6f4918c92d5e7fea1f650d3794e228366652790677d0f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Operations/Variant57f98a1c8229224f08f6f4918c92d5e7fea1f650d3794e228366652790677d0f.lean#L382).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
