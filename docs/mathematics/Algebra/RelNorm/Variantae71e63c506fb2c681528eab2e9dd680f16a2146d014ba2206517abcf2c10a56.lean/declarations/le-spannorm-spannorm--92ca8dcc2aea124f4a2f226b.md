## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d60f04df-3fdf-c5c1-1b36-1b191cc1327d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 227–237.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_spanNorm_spanNorm (I : Ideal S) : spanNorm R I ≤ spanNorm R (spanNorm T I) := by
  simp_rw [spanNorm, map]
  refine span_mono ?_
  rintro _ ⟨x, hx, rfl⟩
  exact ⟨intNorm T S x, subset_span <| Set.mem_image_of_mem _ hx, by rw [intNorm_intNorm]⟩

/--
This condition `eq_bot_or_top` is equivalent to being a field. However,
`Ideal.spanNorm_spanNorm_of_field` would be harder to apply since we'd need to upgrade
a `CommRing R` instance to a `Field R` instance.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RelNorm/Variantae71e63c506fb2c681528eab2e9dd680f16a2146d014ba2206517abcf2c10a56.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RelNorm/Variantae71e63c506fb2c681528eab2e9dd680f16a2146d014ba2206517abcf2c10a56.lean#L227).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `37680f001821b4d78db5800800f90367922673f9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
