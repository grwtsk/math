## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6b74887d65aa04626ff85f5b957bebd9f381e0047acd16d4441065e240f13413`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 84–107.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class BinomialRing (R : Type*) [AddCommMonoid R] [Pow R ℕ] where
  -- This base class has been demoted to a field, to avoid creating
  -- an expensive global instance.
  [toIsAddTorsionFree : IsAddTorsionFree R]
  /-- A multichoose function, giving the quotient of Pochhammer evaluations by factorials. -/
  multichoose : R → ℕ → R
  /-- The `n`th ascending Pochhammer polynomial evaluated at any element is divisible by `n!` -/
  factorial_nsmul_multichoose (r : R) (n : ℕ) :
    n.factorial • multichoose r n = (ascPochhammer ℕ n).smeval r

-- This is only a local instance as it otherwise causes significant slow downs
-- to every call to `grind` involving a ring. Please do not make it a global instance.
-- (~1500 heartbeats measured on `nightly-testing-2025-09-09`.)
attribute [local instance] BinomialRing.toIsAddTorsionFree

section Multichoose

namespace Ring

variable {R : Type*} [AddCommMonoid R] [Pow R ℕ] [BinomialRing R]

/-- The multichoose function is the quotient of ascending Pochhammer evaluation by the corresponding
factorial. When applied to natural numbers, `multichoose k n` describes choosing a multiset of `n`
items from a type of size `k`, i.e., choosing with replacement. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Binomial/Variant36c4cb9e3b171d2eaad308a77d43c75fbe5abbec37b905fca0be8f9cf2d01d5e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Binomial/Variant36c4cb9e3b171d2eaad308a77d43c75fbe5abbec37b905fca0be8f9cf2d01d5e.lean#L84).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c57269dd00db4f80d58a1c70cd0d803ddee0c7a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
