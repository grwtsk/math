## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9a7c807e-12dd-6f21-f644-9d6d87454324`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem recursiveCumulantFamily_zero
    (moments : DirectionMomentFamily E R)
    (directions : Fin 0 → E) :
    recursiveCumulantFamily moments 0 directions = 0 := by
  change recursiveCumulantAux moments 0 directions = 0
  rw [recursiveCumulantAux_eq_step]
  rfl

/-- The successor-order defining equation.  The n+1 cumulant is the n+1 moment
minus the proper-partition contribution computed from the already constructed
lower orders. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RecursiveCumulantHierarchy/Variant6c6e1d227e9923ae53c432ae0fb8bc213d0005254df8262e06a3dc4af765b081.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RecursiveCumulantHierarchy/Variant6c6e1d227e9923ae53c432ae0fb8bc213d0005254df8262e06a3dc4af765b081.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ffd390d5f4fc8a75ff817aebf4a533837c85f3a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
