## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:39bfe972-83a2-4245-cdd8-fae27bcedaf2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–162.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem recursiveCumulantFamily_eq_recursive
    (moments : DirectionMomentFamily E R)
    (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n)
    (directions : Fin n → E) :
    recursiveCumulantFamily moments n directions =
      recursiveDirectionalCumulant
        n hn (moments n)
        (recursiveCumulantFamily moments)
        directions := by
  cases n with
  | zero =>
      exact (Nat.not_lt_zero _ hn).elim
  | succ n =>
      simpa using
        recursiveCumulantFamily_succ moments n directions

/-- Expanded positive-order equation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RecursiveCumulantHierarchy/Variantd02aba7d960716e16a5beb5fce9e08f5959eea0575663fc8a61d7c2085d216cc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RecursiveCumulantHierarchy/Variantd02aba7d960716e16a5beb5fce9e08f5959eea0575663fc8a61d7c2085d216cc.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `941fc480b26df1bb458d045be67c5e059c5d70df` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
