## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b47fb29e-3ba0-643e-57f0-598be36b5850`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 246–259.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem unitization_range : (unitization s).range = StarAlgebra.adjoin R s := by
  rw [unitization, Unitization.starLift_range]
  simp only [NonUnitalStarAlgHom.coe_range, NonUnitalStarSubalgebraClass.coe_subtype,
    Subtype.range_coe_subtype]
  rfl

end Semiring

section Field

variable {R S A : Type*} [Field R] [StarRing R] [Ring A] [StarRing A] [Algebra R A]
  [StarModule R A] [SetLike S A] [hSA : NonUnitalSubringClass S A] [hSRA : SMulMemClass S R A]
  [StarMemClass S A] (s : S)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Unitization/Variantc09a0d45de7e42eb9842ccf3593ab35eef74eeb80f4c5e25025ebb0f851efee8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Unitization/Variantc09a0d45de7e42eb9842ccf3593ab35eef74eeb80f4c5e25025ebb0f851efee8.lean#L246).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8238c92c20cd363bae8ded0075bcf82757da3514` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
