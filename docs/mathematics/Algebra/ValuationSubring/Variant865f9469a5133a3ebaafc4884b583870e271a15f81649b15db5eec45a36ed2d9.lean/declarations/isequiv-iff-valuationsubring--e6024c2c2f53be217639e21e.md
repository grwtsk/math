## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0cf61e34-7b3a-0242-f91f-beb2e2af9370`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 448–457.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isEquiv_iff_valuationSubring :
    v₁.IsEquiv v₂ ↔ v₁.valuationSubring = v₂.valuationSubring := by
  constructor
  · intro h; ext x; specialize h x 1; simpa using h
  · intro h; apply isEquiv_of_val_le_one
    intro x
    have : x ∈ v₁.valuationSubring ↔ x ∈ v₂.valuationSubring := by rw [h]
    simpa using this
#align valuation.is_equiv_iff_valuation_subring Valuation.isEquiv_iff_valuationSubring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/ValuationSubring/Variant865f9469a5133a3ebaafc4884b583870e271a15f81649b15db5eec45a36ed2d9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/ValuationSubring/Variant865f9469a5133a3ebaafc4884b583870e271a15f81649b15db5eec45a36ed2d9.lean#L448).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d166e10be6c81bee254371ab1d283e62605f6104` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
