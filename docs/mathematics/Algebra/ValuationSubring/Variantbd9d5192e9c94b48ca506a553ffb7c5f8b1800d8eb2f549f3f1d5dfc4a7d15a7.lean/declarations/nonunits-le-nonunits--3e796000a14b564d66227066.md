## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:be72a4b0-2093-d766-43fc-b3bffebbc91e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 502–510.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nonunits_le_nonunits {A B : ValuationSubring K} : B.nonunits ≤ A.nonunits ↔ A ≤ B := by
  constructor
  · intro h x hx
    by_cases h_1 : x = 0; · simp only [h_1, zero_mem]
    rw [← valuation_le_one_iff, ← not_lt, Valuation.one_lt_val_iff _ h_1] at hx ⊢
    by_contra h_2; exact hx (h h_2)
  · intro h x hx
    by_contra h_1; exact not_lt.2 (monotone_mapOfLE _ _ h (not_lt.1 h_1)) hx

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/ValuationSubring/Variantbd9d5192e9c94b48ca506a553ffb7c5f8b1800d8eb2f549f3f1d5dfc4a7d15a7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/ValuationSubring/Variantbd9d5192e9c94b48ca506a553ffb7c5f8b1800d8eb2f549f3f1d5dfc4a7d15a7.lean#L502).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1441979692f38c04be1d94996f13aa1e610290aa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
