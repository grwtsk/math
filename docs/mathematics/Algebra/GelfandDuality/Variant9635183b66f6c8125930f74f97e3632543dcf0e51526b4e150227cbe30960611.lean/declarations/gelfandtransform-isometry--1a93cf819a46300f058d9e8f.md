## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:020d9bcd-532c-0183-7b78-44f48247978e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 145–160.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem gelfandTransform_isometry : Isometry (gelfandTransform ℂ A) := by
  nontriviality A
  refine AddMonoidHomClass.isometry_of_norm (gelfandTransform ℂ A) fun a => ?_
  /- By `spectrum.gelfandTransform_eq`, the spectra of `star a * a` and its
    `gelfandTransform` coincide. Therefore, so do their spectral radii, and since they are
    self-adjoint, so also do their norms. Applying the C⋆-property of the norm and taking square
    roots shows that the norm is preserved. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/GelfandDuality/Variant9635183b66f6c8125930f74f97e3632543dcf0e51526b4e150227cbe30960611.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GelfandDuality/Variant9635183b66f6c8125930f74f97e3632543dcf0e51526b4e150227cbe30960611.lean#L145).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3c2ed642b157d050016e64ba454c4f7c86a2e468` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
