## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:770927f6-8dc2-7960-7e37-9e8dac5162b6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 160–192.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem gelfandTransform_bijective : Function.Bijective (gelfandTransform ℂ A) := by
  refine ⟨(gelfandTransform_isometry A).injective, ?_⟩
  /- The range of `gelfandTransform ℂ A` is actually a `StarSubalgebra`. The key lemma below may be
    hard to spot; it's `map_star` coming from `WeakDual.Complex.instStarHomClass`, which is a
    nontrivial result. -/
  let rng : StarSubalgebra ℂ C(characterSpace ℂ A, ℂ) :=
    { toSubalgebra := (gelfandTransform ℂ A).range
      star_mem' := by
        rintro - ⟨a, rfl⟩
        use star a
        ext1 φ
        dsimp
        simp only [map_star, RCLike.star_def] }
  suffices rng = ⊤ from
    fun x => show x ∈ rng from this.symm ▸ StarSubalgebra.mem_top
  /- Because the `gelfandTransform ℂ A` is an isometry, it has closed range, and so by the
    Stone-Weierstrass theorem, it suffices to show that the image of the Gelfand transform separates
    points in `C(characterSpace ℂ A, ℂ)` and is closed under `star`. -/
  have h : rng.topologicalClosure = rng := le_antisymm
    (StarSubalgebra.topologicalClosure_minimal le_rfl
      (gelfandTransform_isometry A).isClosedEmbedding.isClosed_range)
    (StarSubalgebra.le_topologicalClosure _)
  refine h ▸ ContinuousMap.starSubalgebra_topologicalClosure_eq_top_of_separatesPoints
    _ (fun _ _ => ?_)
  /- Separating points just means that elements of the `characterSpace` which agree at all points
    of `A` are the same functional, which is just extensionality. -/
  contrapose!
  exact fun h => Subtype.ext (ContinuousLinearMap.ext fun a =>
    h (gelfandTransform ℂ A a) ⟨gelfandTransform ℂ A a, ⟨a, rfl⟩, rfl⟩)

/-- The Gelfand transform as a `StarAlgEquiv` between a commutative unital C⋆-algebra over `ℂ`
and the continuous functions on its `characterSpace`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/GelfandDuality/Variantfdfb1aee3be9789350ebad994ba4e05a22e8a9a905bf5d6becb6009b9278e575.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GelfandDuality/Variantfdfb1aee3be9789350ebad994ba4e05a22e8a9a905bf5d6becb6009b9278e575.lean#L160).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e3b392572575c4fbb58bf5068d7c034a8fc156a4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
