## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bc978cf8c1a265d6fab618429dc334a53b31f9124da5222e1cfeeede369bcfe0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 35–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure AlgEquiv (R : Type u) (A : Type v) (B : Type w) [CommSemiring R] [Semiring A] [Semiring B]
  [Algebra R A] [Algebra R B] extends A ≃ B, A ≃* B, A ≃+ B, A ≃+* B where
  /-- An equivalence of algebras commutes with the action of scalars. -/

/-- `AlgEquivClass F R A B` states that `F` is a type of algebra structure preserving
  equivalences. You should extend this class when you extend `AlgEquiv`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Equiv/Variant5556dd450490a8a960acc602be2f074f60e32c3ad265911b50137d9247b1edb5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Equiv/Variant5556dd450490a8a960acc602be2f074f60e32c3ad265911b50137d9247b1edb5.lean#L35).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `40f9bfdc7aa5155a6d2910c24339b1d2808fccf8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
