## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b720dc45fb6fad5def4a03934a38cdf7aa618f9d7bc3a76997c42bb247b4f1b2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 104–122.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : AlgEquivClass (A₁ ≃ₐ[R] A₂) R A₁ A₂ where
  coe f := f.toFun
  inv f := f.invFun
  coe_injective' f g h₁ h₂ := by
    obtain ⟨⟨f,_⟩,_⟩ := f
    obtain ⟨⟨g,_⟩,_⟩ := g
    congr
  map_add := map_add'
  map_mul := map_mul'
  commutes := commutes'
  left_inv f := f.left_inv
  right_inv f := f.right_inv

-- Porting note: replaced with EquivLike instance
-- /-- Helper instance for when there's too many metavariables to apply
-- `fun_like.has_coe_to_fun` directly. -/
-- instance : CoeFun (A₁ ≃ₐ[R] A₂) fun _ => A₁ → A₂ :=
--   ⟨AlgEquiv.toFun⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Equiv/Varianted766ecc8f27e166d39290b43ddfc09ae88c437a6de9db76942c8ad7ab08507e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Equiv/Varianted766ecc8f27e166d39290b43ddfc09ae88c437a6de9db76942c8ad7ab08507e.lean#L104).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `832a8752eaa4497a5ef3f8c08187340a43dbf383` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
