## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8ee5dd863e4faf087b7ade528bfbd97214307e2c12f12647d7f71807e2962431`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 508–515.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def piCongrRight {ι : Type*} {R S : ι → Type*} [∀ i, NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring (R i)]
    [∀ i, NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring (S i)] (e : ∀ i, R i ≃+* S i) : (∀ i, R i) ≃+* ∀ i, S i :=
  { @MulEquiv.piCongrRight ι R S _ _ fun i => (e i).toMulEquiv,
    @AddEquiv.piCongrRight ι R S _ _ fun i => (e i).toAddEquiv with
    toFun := fun x j => e j (x j)
    invFun := fun x j => (e j).symm (x j) }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Equiv/Variantc61c648f31c3093c69a05d62ed08a65a19ea6a27d7c1a0029447d8677f4d2875.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Equiv/Variantc61c648f31c3093c69a05d62ed08a65a19ea6a27d7c1a0029447d8677f4d2875.lean#L508).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f74ee9abc3df6baae868f1e0a872d0fbc2e36e8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
