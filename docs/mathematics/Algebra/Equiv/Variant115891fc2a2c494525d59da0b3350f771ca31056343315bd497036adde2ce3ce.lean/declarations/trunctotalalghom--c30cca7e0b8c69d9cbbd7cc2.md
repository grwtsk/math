## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:54907e63e77a14ac1ceb60d81bfab3cfd726387cef4bd3ad6248f22a0d0c1091`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 267–291.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

def truncTotalAlgHom (σ R : Type*) [Finite σ] [CommRing R] (n : ℕ) :
    MvPowerSeries σ R →ₐ[MvPolynomial σ R]
      MvPolynomial σ R ⧸ (MvPolynomial.idealOfVars σ R) ^ n where
  toFun p := truncTotal n p
  map_one' := by
    by_cases! h : n = 0
    · have := Ideal.Quotient.subsingleton_iff.mpr

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Equiv/Variant115891fc2a2c494525d59da0b3350f771ca31056343315bd497036adde2ce3ce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Equiv/Variant115891fc2a2c494525d59da0b3350f771ca31056343315bd497036adde2ce3ce.lean#L267).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac6c911d76d886934f8428c5a503f9d5b20dd41d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
