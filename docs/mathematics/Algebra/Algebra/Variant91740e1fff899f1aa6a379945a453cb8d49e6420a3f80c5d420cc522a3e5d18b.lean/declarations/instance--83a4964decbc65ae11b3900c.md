## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:da4ddf84575f749e4d3bb91c9e37fc02fff75a1483f4b75f1cd6e15734a0ffdf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–169.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : CommRing (AdicCauchySequence I R) :=
  let f : AdicCauchySequence I R → (ℕ → R) := Subtype.val
  Subtype.val_injective.commRing f rfl rfl
    (fun _ _ ↦ rfl) (fun _ _ ↦ rfl) (fun _ ↦ rfl) (fun _ _ ↦ rfl) (fun _ _ ↦ rfl)
    (fun _ _ ↦ rfl) (fun _ _ ↦ rfl) (fun _ ↦ rfl) (fun _ ↦ rfl)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Algebra/Variant91740e1fff899f1aa6a379945a453cb8d49e6420a3f80c5d420cc522a3e5d18b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Algebra/Variant91740e1fff899f1aa6a379945a453cb8d49e6420a3f80c5d420cc522a3e5d18b.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `630a366189f782862a8a46c889828f52f4b221cf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
