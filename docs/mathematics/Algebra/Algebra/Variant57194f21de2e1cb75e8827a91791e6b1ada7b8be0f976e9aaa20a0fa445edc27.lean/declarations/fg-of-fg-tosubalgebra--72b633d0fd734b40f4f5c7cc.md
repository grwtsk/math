## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cf5d4ba6-2dd8-b238-07be-e9a17fd31e47`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 198–203.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem fg_of_fg_toSubalgebra (S : IntermediateField F E) (h : S.toSubalgebra.FG) : S.FG := by
  obtain ⟨t, ht⟩ := h
  exact ⟨t, (eq_adjoin_of_eq_algebra_adjoin _ _ _ ht.symm).symm⟩

@[deprecated (since := "2024-10-28")] alias fG_of_fG_toSubalgebra := fg_of_fg_toSubalgebra

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Algebra/Variant57194f21de2e1cb75e8827a91791e6b1ada7b8be0f976e9aaa20a0fa445edc27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Algebra/Variant57194f21de2e1cb75e8827a91791e6b1ada7b8be0f976e9aaa20a0fa445edc27.lean#L198).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b8208c1f4c906953a65d0c8fb471b5200d6a70fa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
