## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cadd69b0-dc97-424f-d668-a314421e9a2e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 163–168.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isAlgebraic_algebraMap_iff {a : S} (h : Function.Injective (algebraMap S A)) :
    IsAlgebraic R (algebraMap S A a) ↔ IsAlgebraic R a :=
  ⟨fun ⟨p, hp0, hp⟩ => ⟨p, hp0, h (by rwa [map_zero, ← aeval_algebraMap_apply])⟩,
    isAlgebraic_algebraMap_of_isAlgebraic⟩
#align is_algebraic_algebra_map_iff isAlgebraic_algebraMap_iff

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Algebraic/Varianta559f87e95e3257a754c9800a8f0af02da2e3e2fa2268909a3d8dc2314035350.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Algebraic/Varianta559f87e95e3257a754c9800a8f0af02da2e3e2fa2268909a3d8dc2314035350.lean#L163).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `018a1223267835ca45d23b5cc9f0b3125ebd3006` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
