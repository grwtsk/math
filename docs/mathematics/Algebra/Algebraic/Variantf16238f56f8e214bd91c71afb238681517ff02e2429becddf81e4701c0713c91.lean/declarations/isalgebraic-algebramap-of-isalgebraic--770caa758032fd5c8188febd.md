## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e9d5812c-d6b3-7f40-8a6f-24931dc513eb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 147–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isAlgebraic_algebraMap_of_isAlgebraic {a : S} :
    IsAlgebraic R a → IsAlgebraic R (algebraMap S A a) := fun ⟨f, hf₁, hf₂⟩ =>
  ⟨f, hf₁, by rw [aeval_algebraMap_apply, hf₂, map_zero]⟩
#align is_algebraic_algebra_map_of_is_algebraic isAlgebraic_algebraMap_of_isAlgebraic

/-- This is slightly more general than `isAlgebraic_algebraMap_of_isAlgebraic` in that it
  allows noncommutative intermediate rings `A`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Algebraic/Variantf16238f56f8e214bd91c71afb238681517ff02e2429becddf81e4701c0713c91.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Algebraic/Variantf16238f56f8e214bd91c71afb238681517ff02e2429becddf81e4701c0713c91.lean#L147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8dcf46a9be16b35f1bb3c06e21313e0244d2f58a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
