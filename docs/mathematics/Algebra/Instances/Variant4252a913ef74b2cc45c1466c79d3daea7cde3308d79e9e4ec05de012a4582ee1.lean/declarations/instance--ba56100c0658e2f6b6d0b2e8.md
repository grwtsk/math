## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:684faeb905421ee1a182b88d4a57380844b81f9cf54ba982b8efb85d6841eb47`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 48–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [Algebra.IsSeparable p.ResidueField q.ResidueField] :
    Algebra.IsSeparable (A ⧸ p) (B ⧸ q) := by
  refine Algebra.IsSeparable.of_equiv_equiv
    (.symm <| .ofBijective _ p.bijective_algebraMap_quotient_residueField)
    (.symm <| .ofBijective _ q.bijective_algebraMap_quotient_residueField) ?_
  apply RingHom.ext fun x ↦ ?_
  obtain ⟨x, rfl⟩ :=
    (RingEquiv.ofBijective _ p.bijective_algebraMap_quotient_residueField).surjective x
  obtain ⟨x, rfl⟩ := Ideal.Quotient.mk_surjective x
  apply (RingEquiv.ofBijective _ q.bijective_algebraMap_quotient_residueField).injective
  simp only [RingHom.coe_comp, RingHom.coe_coe, Function.comp_apply, RingEquiv.symm_apply_apply,
    RingEquiv.apply_symm_apply]
  simp [RingHom.algebraMap_toAlgebra, ← IsScalarTower.algebraMap_apply]

variable {p q} in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Instances/Variant4252a913ef74b2cc45c1466c79d3daea7cde3308d79e9e4ec05de012a4582ee1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Instances/Variant4252a913ef74b2cc45c1466c79d3daea7cde3308d79e9e4ec05de012a4582ee1.lean#L48).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ef063a954654ff799255442a0c428f0f8b3e7c3e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
