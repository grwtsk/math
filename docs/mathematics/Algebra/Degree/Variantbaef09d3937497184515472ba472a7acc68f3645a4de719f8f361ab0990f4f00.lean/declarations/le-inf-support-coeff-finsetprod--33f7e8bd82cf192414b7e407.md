## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eda86513-4e81-e711-068c-d6738f50c174`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 219–261.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

section SupDegree

variable [SemilatticeSup B] [OrderBot B] (D : A → B)

/-- Let `R` be a semiring, let `A` be an `AddZeroClass`, let `B` be an `OrderBot`,
and let `D : A → B` be a "degree" function.
For an element `f : R[A]`, the element `supDegree f : B` is the supremum of all the elements in the
support of `f`, or `⊥` if `f` is zero.
Often, the Type `B` is `WithBot A`,
If, further, `A` has a linear order, then this notion coincides with the usual one,
using the maximum of the exponents.

If `A := σ →₀ ℕ` then `R[A] = MvPolynomial σ R`, and if we equip `σ` with a linear order then
the induced linear order on `Lex A` equips `MvPolynomial` ring with a
[monomial order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial_order) (i.e. a linear order on `A`, the
type of (monic) monomials in `R[A]`, that respects addition). We make use of this monomial order
by taking `D := toLex`, and different monomial orders could be accessed via different type
synonyms once they are added. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Degree/Variantbaef09d3937497184515472ba472a7acc68f3645a4de719f8f361ab0990f4f00.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Degree/Variantbaef09d3937497184515472ba472a7acc68f3645a4de719f8f361ab0990f4f00.lean#L219).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a635e211d305433b2ea705c510342ead9c29ea0e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
