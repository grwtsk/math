## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7ee5f4eab04ce79d047cd4876c7312c91345538607c7f8fbc683d5d8297940b2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 59–65.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def pointwiseMulSemiringAction {R : Type*} [CommRing R] [MulSemiringAction M R] :
    MulSemiringAction M (Ideal R) where
  smul_one a := by simp only [Ideal.one_eq_top]; exact Ideal.map_top _
  smul_mul a I J := Ideal.map_mul (MulSemiringAction.toRingHom _ _ a) I J

scoped[Pointwise] attribute [instance] Ideal.pointwiseMulSemiringAction

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Pointwise/Varianta1ed8f3147ef0f3e56fa041e3496955b55eae99618356a1023b0c40b557cbb2c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Pointwise/Varianta1ed8f3147ef0f3e56fa041e3496955b55eae99618356a1023b0c40b557cbb2c.lean#L59).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b0e11fa05f8d9117b7e1f56b3c7bc3b87cb96743` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
