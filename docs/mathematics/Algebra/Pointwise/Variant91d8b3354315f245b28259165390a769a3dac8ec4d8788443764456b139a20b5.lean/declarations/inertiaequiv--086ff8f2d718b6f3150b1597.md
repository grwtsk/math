## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8cd6a52c4a903d444baa8b84fdf4aaf9366c8bac776b5aa4db6f6d39f0929506`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 216–222.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def inertiaEquiv {R : Type*} [Ring R] [MulSemiringAction M R] [MulSemiringAction N R] (I : Ideal R)
    (e : M ≃* N) (he : ∀ (m : M) (x : R), (e m) • x = m • x) :
    inertia M I ≃* inertia N I where
  toEquiv := Equiv.subtypeEquiv e fun _ ↦ by simp [he]
  map_mul' := by simp

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Pointwise/Variant91d8b3354315f245b28259165390a769a3dac8ec4d8788443764456b139a20b5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Pointwise/Variant91d8b3354315f245b28259165390a769a3dac8ec4d8788443764456b139a20b5.lean#L216).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1855fd9ff8ddd5c1cf65b8b7fd365aed6529ac58` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
