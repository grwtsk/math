## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4706c7d7-5812-251e-d84b-e56978295b6c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 59–67.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma coeff_freeMonic :
    (freeMonic R n).coeff k = if h : k < n then .X ⟨k, h⟩ else if k = n then 1 else 0 := by
  simp only [freeMonic, Polynomial.coeff_add, Polynomial.coeff_X_pow, Polynomial.finsetSum_coeff,
    Polynomial.coeff_C_mul, mul_ite, mul_one, mul_zero]
  by_cases h : k < n
  · simp +contextual [Finset.sum_eq_single (ι := Fin n) (a := ⟨k, h⟩),
      Fin.ext_iff, @eq_comm _ k, h, h.ne']
  · rw [Finset.sum_eq_zero fun x _ ↦ ite_eq_right (by cases x; lia), add_zero, dite_eq_right h]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/UniversalFactorizationRing/Variant82280c875c83bb979ce1c61ac0f1c6186fc3b6eb0043988e0d3e8f022554b95a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/UniversalFactorizationRing/Variant82280c875c83bb979ce1c61ac0f1c6186fc3b6eb0043988e0d3e8f022554b95a.lean#L59).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `56a1041889cc9095ca7ab293316e7658cdf2bfe1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
