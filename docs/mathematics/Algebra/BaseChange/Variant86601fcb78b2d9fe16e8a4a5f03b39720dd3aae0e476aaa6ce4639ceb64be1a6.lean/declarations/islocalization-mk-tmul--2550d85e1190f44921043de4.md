## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:02a770fe-0a16-bf7f-d3c6-a63d9cda493d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 236–244.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma IsLocalization.mk'_tmul (M : Submonoid R) [IsLocalization M A] (s : S) (x : R) (y : M) :
    IsLocalization.mk' A x y ⊗ₜ s =
      IsLocalization.mk' (A ⊗[R] S) (algebraMap R S x * s)
        ⟨algebraMap R S y.1, Algebra.mem_algebraMapSubmonoid_of_mem _⟩ := by
  simp [IsLocalization.eq_mk'_iff_mul_eq, map_mul, ← IsScalarTower.algebraMap_apply,
    RingHom.algebraMap_toAlgebra]

namespace IsLocalization.Away

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/BaseChange/Variant86601fcb78b2d9fe16e8a4a5f03b39720dd3aae0e476aaa6ce4639ceb64be1a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/BaseChange/Variant86601fcb78b2d9fe16e8a4a5f03b39720dd3aae0e476aaa6ce4639ceb64be1a6.lean#L236).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0c7dee33cb587aa0ee020b89e761413f1d2fbd99` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
