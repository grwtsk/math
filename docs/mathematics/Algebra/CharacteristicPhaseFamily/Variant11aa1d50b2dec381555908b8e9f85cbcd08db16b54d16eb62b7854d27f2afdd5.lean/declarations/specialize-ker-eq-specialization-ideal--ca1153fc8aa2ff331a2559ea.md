## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:10ac4301-d387-ea4e-9816-c4d16e73668b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 385–394.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem specialize_ker_eq_specialization_ideal (c : ℂ) :
    RingHom.ker (specialize c).toRingHom = specializationIdeal c := by
  ext z
  rw [RingHom.mem_ker]
  change specialize c z = 0 ↔ z ∈ specializationIdeal c
  rw [← specialization_equiv_apply_mk]
  rw [← map_zero (specializationEquiv c), (specializationEquiv c).injective.eq_iff]
  exact Ideal.Quotient.eq_zero_iff_mem

/-- The phase-one fiber is canonically the already established characteristic quotient. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/CharacteristicPhaseFamily/Variant11aa1d50b2dec381555908b8e9f85cbcd08db16b54d16eb62b7854d27f2afdd5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/CharacteristicPhaseFamily/Variant11aa1d50b2dec381555908b8e9f85cbcd08db16b54d16eb62b7854d27f2afdd5.lean#L385).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `eb6c104e6b5354e79ca906e8466fa9ee2172fcad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
