## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:944e2f5ecae281cebf79312a386d19395f07ebc1516fd6f444cb5738b4cf0b22`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 146–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isLocalization_atPrime_localization_atPrime (p : Ideal (Localization M))
    [p.IsPrime] : IsLocalization.AtPrime (Localization.AtPrime p) (p.comap (algebraMap R _)) :=
  isLocalization_isLocalization_atPrime_isLocalization M _ _

/-- Given a submodule `M ⊆ R` and a prime ideal `p` of `M⁻¹R`, with `f : R →+* S` the localization
map, then `(M⁻¹R)ₚ` is isomorphic (as an `R`-algebra) to the localization of `R` at `f⁻¹(p)`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/LocalizationLocalization/Variantfe1b0b6df850a30de087c5c526c26304bc90db060fa1f8387c4d0f3b779b998a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LocalizationLocalization/Variantfe1b0b6df850a30de087c5c526c26304bc90db060fa1f8387c4d0f3b779b998a.lean#L146).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d1ae05d499f42ed6654839987c7f1d2a7cbfe18` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
