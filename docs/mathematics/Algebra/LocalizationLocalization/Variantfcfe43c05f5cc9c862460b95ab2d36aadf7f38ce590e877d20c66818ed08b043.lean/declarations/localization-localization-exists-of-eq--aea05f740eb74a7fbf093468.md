## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a369b024-20b8-1c95-a6d1-24094e856cca`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem localization_localization_exists_of_eq [IsLocalization N T] (x y : R) :
    algebraMap R T x = algebraMap R T y →
      ∃ c : localizationLocalizationSubmodule M N, ↑c * x = ↑c * y := by
  rw [IsScalarTower.algebraMap_apply R S T, IsScalarTower.algebraMap_apply R S T,
    IsLocalization.eq_iff_exists N T]
  rintro ⟨z, eq₁⟩
  rcases IsLocalization.surj M (z : S) with ⟨⟨z', s⟩, eq₂⟩
  dsimp only at eq₂
  suffices (algebraMap R S) (x * z' : R) = (algebraMap R S) (y * z') by
    obtain ⟨c, eq₃ : ↑c * (x * z') = ↑c * (y * z')⟩ := (IsLocalization.eq_iff_exists M S).mp this
    refine ⟨⟨c * z', ?_⟩, ?_⟩
    · rw [mem_localizationLocalizationSubmodule]
      refine ⟨z, c * s, ?_⟩
      rw [map_mul, ← eq₂, Submonoid.coe_mul, map_mul, mul_left_comm]
    · rwa [mul_comm _ z', mul_comm _ z', ← mul_assoc, ← mul_assoc] at eq₃
  rw [map_mul, map_mul, ← eq₂, ← mul_assoc, ← mul_assoc, mul_comm _ (z : S), eq₁,
    mul_comm _ (z : S)]

/-- Given submodules `M ⊆ R` and `N ⊆ S = M⁻¹R`, with `f : R →+* S` the localization map, we have
`N ⁻¹ S = T = (f⁻¹ (N • f(M))) ⁻¹ R`. I.e., the localization of a localization is a localization.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/LocalizationLocalization/Variantfcfe43c05f5cc9c862460b95ab2d36aadf7f38ce590e877d20c66818ed08b043.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LocalizationLocalization/Variantfcfe43c05f5cc9c862460b95ab2d36aadf7f38ce590e877d20c66818ed08b043.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6627644612543b753f443169fef0d405f8581f2b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
