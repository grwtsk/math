## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c803b447c1c63c8f2f08fc48a63b75d58bde0da2b154a7e31d66de28a90d6bbc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 76–81.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ringModIdeals (I : D ⥤ Ideal R) : D ⥤ ModuleCat.{u} R where
  obj t := ModuleCat.of R <| R ⧸ I.obj t
  map w := ModuleCat.ofHom <| Submodule.mapQ _ _ LinearMap.id (I.map w).down.down

/-- The diagram we will take the colimit of to define local cohomology, corresponding to the
directed system determined by the functor `I` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/LocalCohomology/Variantd83419c0ec113642f0281efd27c69f4f89c6ca297f04c75c3b5d0278dc08e9e8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LocalCohomology/Variantd83419c0ec113642f0281efd27c69f4f89c6ca297f04c75c3b5d0278dc08e9e8.lean#L76).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8cebfd9b542eb9e8203bfbcb806ae9f1adc818d5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
