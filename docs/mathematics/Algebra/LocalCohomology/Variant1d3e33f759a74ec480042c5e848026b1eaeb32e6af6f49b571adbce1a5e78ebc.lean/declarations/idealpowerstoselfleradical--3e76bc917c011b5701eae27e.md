## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a60bff015f1f3f2281a7b2243002e9d96443a445be67425e4c323a72d9b1ee53`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 217–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def idealPowersToSelfLERadical (J : Ideal R) : ℕᵒᵖ ⥤ SelfLERadical J :=
  FullSubcategory.lift _ (idealPowersDiagram J) fun k => by
    change _ ≤ (J ^ unop k).radical
    cases' unop k with n
    · simp [Ideal.radical_top, pow_zero, Ideal.one_eq_top, le_top, Nat.zero_eq]
    · simp only [J.radical_pow _ n.succ_pos, Ideal.le_radical]
#align local_cohomology.ideal_powers_to_self_le_radical localCohomology.idealPowersToSelfLERadical

variable {I J K : Ideal R}

/-- The lemma below essentially says that `idealPowersToSelfLERadical I` is initial in
`selfLERadicalDiagram I`.

PORTING NOTE: This lemma should probably be moved to `Mathlib/RingTheory/Finiteness`
to be near `Ideal.exists_radical_pow_le_of_fg`, which it generalizes. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/LocalCohomology/Variant1d3e33f759a74ec480042c5e848026b1eaeb32e6af6f49b571adbce1a5e78ebc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LocalCohomology/Variant1d3e33f759a74ec480042c5e848026b1eaeb32e6af6f49b571adbce1a5e78ebc.lean#L217).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3685b8fcdcf19cd98d0c0cd48c1676952621749f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
