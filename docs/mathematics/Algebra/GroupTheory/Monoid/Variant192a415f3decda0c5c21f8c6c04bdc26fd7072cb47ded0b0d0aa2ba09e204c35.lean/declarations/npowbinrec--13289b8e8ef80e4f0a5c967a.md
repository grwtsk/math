## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0f9d0623376057e0de95a393719539a0b17989efafc031d91ed3f4530d26d370`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 239–249.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def npowBinRec {M : Type*} [One M] [Mul M] (k : ℕ) : M → M :=
  npowBinRec.go k 1
where
  /-- Auxiliary tail-recursive implementation for `npowBinRec`. -/
  @[to_additive nsmulBinRec.go /-- Auxiliary tail-recursive implementation for `nsmulBinRec`. -/]
  go (k : ℕ) : M → M → M :=
    k.binaryRec (fun y _ ↦ y) fun bn _n fn y x ↦ fn (cond bn (y * x) y) (x * x)

/--
A variant of `npowRec` which is a semigroup homomorphism from `ℕ₊` to `M`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Monoid/Variant192a415f3decda0c5c21f8c6c04bdc26fd7072cb47ded0b0d0aa2ba09e204c35.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Monoid/Variant192a415f3decda0c5c21f8c6c04bdc26fd7072cb47ded0b0d0aa2ba09e204c35.lean#L239).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `302c444f017235acc1271402facc00d8492ad1b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
