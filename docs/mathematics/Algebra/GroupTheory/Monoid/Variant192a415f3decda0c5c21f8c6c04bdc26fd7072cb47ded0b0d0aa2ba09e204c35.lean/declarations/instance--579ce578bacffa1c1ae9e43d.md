## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0191fc35449b7c82ae0f8e3f238a845c5c193e776c0d3d1b4ad1bb4ebbc57a84`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 602–623.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) CancelMonoid.toIsCancelMul (M : Type*) [CancelMonoid M] :
    IsCancelMul M where

end CancelMonoid

/-! We initialize the projections for the monoid structures for `@[simps]` here.

The lemmas generated for the `npow`/`zpow` projections will *not* apply to `x ^ y`, since the
argument order of these projections does not match the argument order of `^`. The `nsmul`/`zsmul`
lemmas are correct. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Monoid/Variant192a415f3decda0c5c21f8c6c04bdc26fd7072cb47ded0b0d0aa2ba09e204c35.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Monoid/Variant192a415f3decda0c5c21f8c6c04bdc26fd7072cb47ded0b0d0aa2ba09e204c35.lean#L602).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `302c444f017235acc1271402facc00d8492ad1b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
