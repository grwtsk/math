## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ad13a751b321704366d6fb429466948b1c359306d4f92ed1dca4c7f46cfff02d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–135.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure OrderMonoidHom (α β : Type*) [Preorder α] [Preorder β] [MulOneClass α]
  [MulOneClass β] extends α →* β where
  /-- An `OrderMonoidHom` is a monotone function. -/
  monotone' : Monotone toFun

/-- Infix notation for `OrderMonoidHom`. -/
infixr:25 " →*o " => OrderMonoidHom

variable [Preorder α] [Preorder β] [MulOneClass α] [MulOneClass β] [FunLike F α β]

/-- Turn an element of a type `F` satisfying `OrderHomClass F α β` and `MonoidHomClass F α β`
into an actual `OrderMonoidHom`. This is declared as the default coercion from `F` to `α →*o β`. -/
@[to_additive (attr := coe)
  "Turn an element of a type `F` satisfying `OrderHomClass F α β` and `AddMonoidHomClass F α β`
  into an actual `OrderAddMonoidHom`.
  This is declared as the default coercion from `F` to `α →+o β`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Monoid/Variant4a6e2e0d74bbfc1b10e4c11cd85e3537070aa8c7479a6c162c2e7ecaf19291b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Monoid/Variant4a6e2e0d74bbfc1b10e4c11cd85e3537070aa8c7479a6c162c2e7ecaf19291b6.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c836ce90140da153f49ae743448fbb69678c0ea0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
