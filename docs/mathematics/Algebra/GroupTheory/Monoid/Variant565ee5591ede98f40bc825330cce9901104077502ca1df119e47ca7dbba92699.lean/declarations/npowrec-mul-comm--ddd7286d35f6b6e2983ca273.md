## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:72d94fce-4962-cfb9-448c-780667eeb893`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 291–299.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem npowRec'_mul_comm {M : Type*} [Semigroup M] [One M] {k : ℕ} (k0 : k ≠ 0) (m : M) :
    m * npowRec' k m = npowRec' k m * m := by
  induction k using Nat.strongRecOn with
  | ind k' ih =>
    match k' with
    | 1 => simp [npowRec']
    | k + 2 => simp [npowRec', ← mul_assoc, ih]

@[to_additive]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Monoid/Variant565ee5591ede98f40bc825330cce9901104077502ca1df119e47ca7dbba92699.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Monoid/Variant565ee5591ede98f40bc825330cce9901104077502ca1df119e47ca7dbba92699.lean#L291).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f9f2ec94a6747b6d499ca6734187796875a2acaf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
