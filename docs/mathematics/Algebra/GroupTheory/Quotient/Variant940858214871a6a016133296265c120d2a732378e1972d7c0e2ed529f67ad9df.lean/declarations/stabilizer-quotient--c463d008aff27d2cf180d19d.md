## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c5d45a4-d765-dd16-8938-d4356b36da8b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 192–212.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem stabilizer_quotient {G} [Group G] (H : Subgroup G) :
    MulAction.stabilizer G ((1 : G) : G ⧸ H) = H := by
  ext
  simp [QuotientGroup.eq]

variable (β)

local notation "Ω" => Quotient <| orbitRel α β

/-- **Class formula** : given `G` a group acting on `X` and `φ` a function mapping each orbit of `X`
under this action (that is, each element of the quotient of `X` by the relation `orbitRel G X`) to
an element in this orbit, this gives a (noncomputable) bijection between `X` and the disjoint union
of `G/Stab(φ(ω))` over all orbits `ω`. In most cases you'll want `φ` to be `Quotient.out`, so we
provide `MulAction.selfEquivSigmaOrbitsQuotientStabilizer'` as a special case. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quotient/Variant940858214871a6a016133296265c120d2a732378e1972d7c0e2ed529f67ad9df.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quotient/Variant940858214871a6a016133296265c120d2a732378e1972d7c0e2ed529f67ad9df.lean#L192).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6392262fb9f727f48726cba67bde4e46dcbc3248` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
