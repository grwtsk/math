## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d56de3f0-352b-c37c-35ce-e661f53c8c17`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 204–225.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem stabilizer_quotient {G} [Group G] (H : Subgroup G) :
    MulAction.stabilizer G ((1 : G) : G ⧸ H) = H := by
  ext
  simp [QuotientGroup.eq]

variable (X)

local notation "Ω" => Quotient <| orbitRel G X

/-- **Class formula** : let `G` be a group acting on `X` and let `φ` be a function mapping each
orbit of `X` under this action (that is, each element of the quotient of `G` by the relation
`orbitRel G X`) to an element in this orbit. We provide a  (noncomputable) bijection between `X`
and the disjoint union of `G/Stab(φ(ω))` over all orbits `ω : Ω`. In most cases you'll want `φ`
to be `Quotient.out`, so we provide `MulAction.selfEquivSigmaOrbitsQuotientStabilizer'` as a
special case. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quotient/Variant7b63485b0cfd7f814897fd197a8d8a0a3c6b5df952b536387a7a3c89a13981eb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quotient/Variant7b63485b0cfd7f814897fd197a8d8a0a3c6b5df952b536387a7a3c89a13981eb.lean#L204).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a2a28ccbb664f5e94ddd571ea66f9e8be14ec04c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
