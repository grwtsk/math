## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:72dd1dde28e1a3bef0586e72eb7810ca54d31e40c14e25f62fb9844469fb832a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 45–51.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class QuotientAction : Prop where
  /-- The action fulfils a normality condition on products that lie in `H`.
    This ensures that the action descends to an action on the quotient `α ⧸ H`. -/
  inv_mul_mem : ∀ (b : β) {a a' : α}, a⁻¹ * a' ∈ H → (b • a)⁻¹ * b • a' ∈ H
#align mul_action.quotient_action MulAction.QuotientAction

/-- A typeclass for when an `AddAction β α` descends to the quotient `α ⧸ H`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quotient/Variantb37097355001843e4a30379e9358c067249b63d249ef87c41209d62c6611ec00.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quotient/Variantb37097355001843e4a30379e9358c067249b63d249ef87c41209d62c6611ec00.lean#L45).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac67a7792bf237603a0e187dcf3ff0d9e1aa7442` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
