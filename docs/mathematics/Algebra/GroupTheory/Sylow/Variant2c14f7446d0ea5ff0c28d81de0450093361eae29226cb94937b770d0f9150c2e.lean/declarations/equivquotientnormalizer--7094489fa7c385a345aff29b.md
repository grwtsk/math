## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a74b749e5fabc1c19fcd920d3f0101f70f07e3df81efd2b5f01c986ded8ac66b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 437–444.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def equivQuotientNormalizer [Fact p.Prime] [Finite (Sylow p G)]
    (P : Sylow p G) : Sylow p G ≃ G ⧸ normalizer P :=
  calc
    Sylow p G ≃ (⊤ : Set (Sylow p G)) := (Equiv.Set.univ (Sylow p G)).symm
    _ ≃ orbit G P := Set.equivOfEq P.orbit_eq_top.symm
    _ ≃ G ⧸ stabilizer G P := orbitEquivQuotientStabilizer G P
    _ ≃ G ⧸ normalizer P := by rw [P.stabilizer_eq_normalizer]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Sylow/Variant2c14f7446d0ea5ff0c28d81de0450093361eae29226cb94937b770d0f9150c2e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Sylow/Variant2c14f7446d0ea5ff0c28d81de0450093361eae29226cb94937b770d0f9150c2e.lean#L437).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3b64a56e684a27db95e3f25558fcd30be78a6dce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
