## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3d8790895e452cf9803059b8e4a0893e311d766250dde603bdf5bae19e2feaab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 211–221.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance pointwiseMulAction {α : Type*} [Group α] [MulDistribMulAction α G] :
    MulAction α (Sylow p G) where
  smul g P :=
    ⟨g • P.toSubgroup, P.2.map _, fun {Q} hQ hS =>
      inv_smul_eq_iff.mp
        (P.3 (hQ.map _) fun s hs =>
          (congr_arg (· ∈ g⁻¹ • Q) (inv_smul_smul g s)).mp
            (smul_mem_pointwise_smul (g • s) g⁻¹ Q (hS (smul_mem_pointwise_smul s g P hs))))⟩
  one_smul P := ext (one_smul α P.toSubgroup)
  mul_smul g h P := ext (mul_smul g h P.toSubgroup)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Sylow/Variant192cc749d2625302f8712e878d0ff1a69aff54cd975129ec3a2ea59a8a884ef9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Sylow/Variant192cc749d2625302f8712e878d0ff1a69aff54cd975129ec3a2ea59a8a884ef9.lean#L211).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f3d3582c5d4b73803bd00c4bc3ddfe98f0eaedb1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
