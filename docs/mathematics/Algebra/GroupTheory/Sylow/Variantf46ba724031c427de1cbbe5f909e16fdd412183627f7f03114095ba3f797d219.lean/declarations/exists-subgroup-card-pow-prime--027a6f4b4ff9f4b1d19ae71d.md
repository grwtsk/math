## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6b719c2d-4d77-c899-d772-4eed62ff6916`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 660–667.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_subgroup_card_pow_prime [Finite G] (p : ℕ) {n : ℕ} [Fact p.Prime]
    (hdvd : p ^ n ∣ Nat.card G) : ∃ K : Subgroup G, Nat.card K = p ^ n :=
  let ⟨K, hK⟩ := exists_subgroup_card_pow_prime_le p hdvd ⊥
    (by rw [card_bot, pow_zero]) n.zero_le
  ⟨K, hK.1⟩

/-- A special case of **Sylow's first theorem**. If `G` is a `p`-group of size at least `p ^ n`
then there is a subgroup of cardinality `p ^ n`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Sylow/Variantf46ba724031c427de1cbbe5f909e16fdd412183627f7f03114095ba3f797d219.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Sylow/Variantf46ba724031c427de1cbbe5f909e16fdd412183627f7f03114095ba3f797d219.lean#L660).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `695ced75729a1d8d7fff3dd361b791a4790a1126` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
