## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9b4de66803e501ea0b89067938151f2dd9701e9651ddbd04e590c2bac8b1266b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 553–567.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def uniqueEquiv (T : Type*) [Unique T] : FreeAbelianGroup T ≃+ ℤ where
  toFun := FreeAbelianGroup.lift fun _ ↦ (1 : ℤ)
  invFun n := n • of Inhabited.default
  left_inv z := FreeAbelianGroup.induction_on z
    (by simp only [zero_smul, map_zero])
    (Unique.forall_iff.2 <| by simp only [one_smul, lift_apply_of]) (Unique.forall_iff.2 <| by simp)
    fun x y hx hy ↦ by
      simp only [map_add, add_smul] at *
      rw [hx, hy]
  right_inv n := by
    rw [map_zsmul, lift_apply_of]
    exact zsmul_one n
  map_add' := map_add _

/-- Isomorphic types have isomorphic free abelian groups. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/FreeAbelianGroup/Variant240fdfd81dd3c41a782a79bdef2c9df60a9bdb0bd50b017a4caa3b85afe7fa2c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/FreeAbelianGroup/Variant240fdfd81dd3c41a782a79bdef2c9df60a9bdb0bd50b017a4caa3b85afe7fa2c.lean#L553).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9a488cb77bef37e2af2b4c84b5f4174eee1625ac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
