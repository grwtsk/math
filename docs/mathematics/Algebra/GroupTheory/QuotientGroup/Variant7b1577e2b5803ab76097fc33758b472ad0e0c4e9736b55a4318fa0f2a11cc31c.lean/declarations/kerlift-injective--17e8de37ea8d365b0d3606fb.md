## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7ca1491a-c0de-9ba0-52e8-c2f7b86a6870`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 377–386.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem kerLift_injective : Injective (kerLift φ) := fun a b =>
  Quotient.inductionOn₂' a b fun a b (h : φ a = φ b) =>
    Quotient.sound' <| by rw [leftRel_apply, mem_ker, φ.map_mul, ← h, φ.map_inv, inv_mul_self]
#align quotient_group.ker_lift_injective QuotientGroup.kerLift_injective
#align quotient_add_group.ker_lift_injective QuotientAddGroup.kerLift_injective

-- Note that `ker φ` isn't definitionally `ker (φ.rangeRestrict)`
-- so there is a bit of annoying code duplication here
/-- The induced map from the quotient by the kernel to the range. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/QuotientGroup/Variant7b1577e2b5803ab76097fc33758b472ad0e0c4e9736b55a4318fa0f2a11cc31c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/QuotientGroup/Variant7b1577e2b5803ab76097fc33758b472ad0e0c4e9736b55a4318fa0f2a11cc31c.lean#L377).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6ba2ec9200577e1127bf502dd9ec7f278be2735d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
