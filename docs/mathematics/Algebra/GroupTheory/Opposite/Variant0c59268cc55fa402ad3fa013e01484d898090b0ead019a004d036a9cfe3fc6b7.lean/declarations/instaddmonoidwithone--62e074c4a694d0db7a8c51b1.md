## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0b11b261e84ca7c48858d4a35a12fa84b585bde275d49ed5b8d590ee4eef559d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 57–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instAddMonoidWithOne [AddMonoidWithOne α] : AddMonoidWithOne αᵐᵒᵖ where
  toNatCast := instNatCast
  toAddMonoid := instAddMonoid
  toOne := instOne
  natCast_zero := show op ((0 : ℕ) : α) = 0 by rw [Nat.cast_zero, op_zero]
  natCast_succ := show ∀ n, op ((n + 1 : ℕ) : α) = op ↑(n : ℕ) + 1 by simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Opposite/Variant0c59268cc55fa402ad3fa013e01484d898090b0ead019a004d036a9cfe3fc6b7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Opposite/Variant0c59268cc55fa402ad3fa013e01484d898090b0ead019a004d036a9cfe3fc6b7.lean#L57).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `307152ddbe9725a0b1269c239f6d84b7fa579cfc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
