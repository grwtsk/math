## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4b2074147991648ceaa9c8bd8a4d84172df46aa7783a88837d906e95530f8909`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 135–141.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance CommSemigroup.isCentralScalar [CommSemigroup α] : IsCentralScalar α α :=
  ⟨fun _ _ => mul_comm _ _⟩
#align comm_semigroup.is_central_scalar CommSemigroup.isCentralScalar
#align add_comm_semigroup.is_central_scalar AddCommSemigroup.isCentralVAdd

/-- Like `Monoid.toMulAction`, but multiplies on the right. -/
@[to_additive "Like `AddMonoid.toAddAction`, but adds on the right."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Opposite/Variantadec7a963d5fb45b31f888983db7a188c9272c5070ecccee2583b17bfc0c973b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Opposite/Variantadec7a963d5fb45b31f888983db7a188c9272c5070ecccee2583b17bfc0c973b.lean#L135).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5f10c9ecda947c5d49d89ef263865ddce4a59e40` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
