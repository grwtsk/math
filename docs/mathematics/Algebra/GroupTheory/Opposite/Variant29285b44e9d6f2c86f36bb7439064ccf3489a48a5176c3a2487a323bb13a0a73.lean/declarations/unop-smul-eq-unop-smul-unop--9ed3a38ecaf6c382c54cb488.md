## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:14abd3bb-1ebf-a185-fa04-29381689a178`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 65–102.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma unop_smul_eq_unop_smul_unop [SMul M α] [SMul Mᵐᵒᵖ α] [IsCentralScalar M α] (r : Mᵐᵒᵖ)
    (a : αᵐᵒᵖ) : unop (r • a) = unop r • unop a := (unop_smul_eq_smul r (unop a)).symm

end MulOpposite

/-!
### Right actions

In this section we establish `SMul αᵐᵒᵖ β` as the canonical spelling of right scalar multiplication
of `β` by `α`, and provide convenient notations.

/-- With `open scoped RightActions`, an alternative symbol for left actions, `r • m`.

In lemma names this is still called `smul`. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Opposite/Variant29285b44e9d6f2c86f36bb7439064ccf3489a48a5176c3a2487a323bb13a0a73.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Opposite/Variant29285b44e9d6f2c86f36bb7439064ccf3489a48a5176c3a2487a323bb13a0a73.lean#L65).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8e75279cfe04dccef17ac40791bdecb79beb47a9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
