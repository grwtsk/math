## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:46607f1258a0f4be43c1a4027b41f0580e006ff1f4169740c8aa4a374ae83516`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 211–225.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def rootableByIntOfRootableByNat [RootableBy A ℕ] : RootableBy A ℤ where
  root a z :=
    match z with
    | (n : ℕ) => RootableBy.root a n
    | -[n+1] => (RootableBy.root a (n + 1))⁻¹
  root_zero a := RootableBy.root_zero a
  root_cancel {n} a hn := by
    cases n
    · rw [Int.ofNat_eq_coe, Nat.cast_ne_zero] at hn
      simp [RootableBy.root_cancel _ hn]
    · simp [RootableBy.root_cancel _ (Nat.add_one_ne_zero _)]

/-- A group is `ℕ`-rootable if it is `ℤ`-rootable
-/
@[to_additive "An additive group is `ℕ`-divisible if it `ℤ`-divisible."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Divisible/Variant9a50a3a5854c6efe5635c95a0323525869b22dd9f4f2b5b41ef78802f054bc9e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Divisible/Variant9a50a3a5854c6efe5635c95a0323525869b22dd9f4f2b5b41ef78802f054bc9e.lean#L211).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d8e3985f4c97faa4d687537bc9ea5149b7caf4e5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
