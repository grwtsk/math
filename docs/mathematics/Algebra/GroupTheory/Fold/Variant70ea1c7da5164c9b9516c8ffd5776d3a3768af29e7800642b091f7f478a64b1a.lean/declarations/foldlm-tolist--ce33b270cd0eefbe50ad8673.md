## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:607a0319-eecb-9dbe-3411-4efd946b0fce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 373–380.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem foldlm_toList {f : α → β → m α} {x : α} {xs : t β} :
    foldlm f x xs = List.foldlM f x (toList xs) :=
  calc foldlm f x xs
    _ = unop (foldlM.ofFreeMonoid f (FreeMonoid.ofList <| toList xs)) x := by
      simp only [foldlm, toList_spec, foldMap_hom_free (foldlM.ofFreeMonoid f),
        foldlm.ofFreeMonoid_comp_of, foldlM.get, FreeMonoid.ofList_toList]
    _ = List.foldlM f x (toList xs) := by simp [foldlM.ofFreeMonoid, unop_op, flip]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Fold/Variant70ea1c7da5164c9b9516c8ffd5776d3a3768af29e7800642b091f7f478a64b1a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Fold/Variant70ea1c7da5164c9b9516c8ffd5776d3a3768af29e7800642b091f7f478a64b1a.lean#L373).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `eb44ef23c3bbda5f0f35db8b80ea017410fb94c5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
