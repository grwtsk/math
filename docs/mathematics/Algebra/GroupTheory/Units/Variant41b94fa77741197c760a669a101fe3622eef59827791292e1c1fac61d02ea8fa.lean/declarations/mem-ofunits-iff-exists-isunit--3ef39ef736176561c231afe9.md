## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ca72c417-e2c0-3655-8a6b-c10b5eef03ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 250–258.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma mem_ofUnits_iff_exists_isUnit (S : Subgroup Mˣ) (x : M) :
    x ∈ S.ofUnits ↔ ∃ h : IsUnit x, h.unit ∈ S :=
  ⟨fun h => ⟨S.isUnit_of_mem_ofUnits h, S.unit_mem_of_mem_ofUnits h⟩,
  fun ⟨hm, he⟩ => S.mem_ofUnits_of_isUnit_of_unit_mem hm he⟩

/-- The equivalence between the coercion of a subgroup `S` of `Mˣ` to a submonoid of `M` and
the subgroup itself as a type. -/
@[to_additive "The equivalence between the coercion of an additive subgroup `S` of
`Mˣ` to an additive submonoid of `M` and the additive subgroup itself as a type."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Units/Variant41b94fa77741197c760a669a101fe3622eef59827791292e1c1fac61d02ea8fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Units/Variant41b94fa77741197c760a669a101fe3622eef59827791292e1c1fac61d02ea8fa.lean#L250).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b55f529a5bda194cb47c6adb8a3d92f8a3fc938e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
