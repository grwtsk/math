## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a39b1988-81b2-3076-3168-451092cbf087`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 223–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isUnit_of_mem_ofUnits (S : Subgroup Mˣ) {x : M} (hx : x ∈ S.ofUnits) : IsUnit x :=
  match hx with
  | ⟨_, _, h⟩ => ⟨_, h⟩

/-- Given some `x : M` which is a member of the submonoid of unit elements corresponding to a
subgroup of units, produce a unit of `M` whose coercion is equal to `x`. -/
@[to_additive /-- Given some `x : M` which is a member of the additive submonoid of additive unit
elements corresponding to a subgroup of units, produce a unit of `M` whose coercion is equal to
`x`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Units/Variant55a459638a876e62e781b1c271991649793b6532321592636788f01284e68c4a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Units/Variant55a459638a876e62e781b1c271991649793b6532321592636788f01284e68c4a.lean#L223).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8076c04baa8ccc698b398895fde2bc6a3e81d537` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
