## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b3a4435db6be58f97ea680460d3d95225fc442b6040705366dcc582b327f8485`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 483–492.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance smulCommClass_right {R : Type*} [SMul R M] [IsScalarTower R M M] :
  SMulCommClass R (Localization S) (Localization S) where
  smul_comm s :=
      Localization.ind <|
        Prod.rec fun r₁ x₁ ↦
          Localization.ind <|
            Prod.rec fun r₂ x₂ ↦ by
              simp only [smul_mk, smul_eq_mul, mk_mul, mul_comm r₁, smul_mul_assoc]
#align localization.smul_comm_class_right Localization.smulCommClass_right

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/MonoidLocalization/Variantbe4a6f0ac031eff72161ad17d3aa7a6b97926838a67376c143fdac3127dcbc9e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/MonoidLocalization/Variantbe4a6f0ac031eff72161ad17d3aa7a6b97926838a67376c143fdac3127dcbc9e.lean#L483).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d763b5e7340438b0e55f07a622ee474b3f3cc701` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
