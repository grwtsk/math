## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4987f253-992f-8de0-c2e9-0b811ad8627b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem matrix_relator_identity :
    ∀ r ∈ braidRelations, FreeGroup.lift generatorMatrix r = 1 := by
  intro r hr
  change r=braidRelator at hr
  subst r
  simp only [braidRelator,map_mul,map_inv,FreeGroup.lift_apply_of]
  simp only [generatorMatrix,ite_true,show (1:Fin 2)≠0 by decide,ite_false]
  rw [matrix_braid_relation,mul_inv_cancel]

/-- Genuine normal-closure quotient lift; relation satisfaction is proved above. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/BraidQuotientAttempt05/Variantd24b85d2a8101ffe32dbe12e934130a29c38f7479266a6c07966eb19f2bccafd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/BraidQuotientAttempt05/Variantd24b85d2a8101ffe32dbe12e934130a29c38f7479266a6c07966eb19f2bccafd.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `668345986739a2f4df06c651dee5ba6fdc05eb85` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
