## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:646ab644-1c0f-54b7-4c14-9a0c3f9865c4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 635–643.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem inv_mul_toLeftFun_mem (hS : IsComplement S H) (g : G) :
    g⁻¹ * toLeftFun hS g ∈ H :=
  (congr_arg (· ∈ H) (by rw [mul_inv_rev, inv_inv])).mp (H.inv_mem (inv_toLeftFun_mul_mem hS g))

@[deprecated (since := "2024-12-28")]
alias _root_.Subgroup.MemLeftTransversals.inv_mul_toFun_mem := inv_mul_toLeftFun_mem

/-- A right transversal is in bijection with right cosets. -/
@[to_additive "A right transversal is in bijection with right cosets."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Complement/Variant7e2adf91a97ab0b42cf032ad24522c97d40f81dd725e774ccf3a52efef33737d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Complement/Variant7e2adf91a97ab0b42cf032ad24522c97d40f81dd725e774ccf3a52efef33737d.lean#L635).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3672bee13135ee61960b91d7f4f8b8bf97ea9192` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
