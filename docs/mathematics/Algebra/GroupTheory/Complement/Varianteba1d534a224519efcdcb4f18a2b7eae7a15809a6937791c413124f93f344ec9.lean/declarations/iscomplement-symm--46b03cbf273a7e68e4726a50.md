## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:070770a4-fdb8-38b2-5313-86764f0064b6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  let ϕ : H × K ≃ K × H :=
    Equiv.mk (fun x => ⟨x.2⁻¹, x.1⁻¹⟩) (fun x => ⟨x.2⁻¹, x.1⁻¹⟩)
      (fun x => Prod.ext (inv_inv _) (inv_inv _)) fun x => Prod.ext (inv_inv _) (inv_inv _)
  let ψ : G ≃ G := Equiv.mk (fun g : G => g⁻¹) (fun g : G => g⁻¹) inv_inv inv_inv
  suffices hf : (ψ ∘ fun x : H × K => x.1.1 * x.2.1) = (fun x : K × H => x.1.1 * x.2.1) ∘ ϕ by

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Complement/Varianteba1d534a224519efcdcb4f18a2b7eae7a15809a6937791c413124f93f344ec9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Complement/Varianteba1d534a224519efcdcb4f18a2b7eae7a15809a6937791c413124f93f344ec9.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `53f23fbe79300b362b4d05124ef7f35025a90aa4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
