## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:75e5fcff291c33bd96162646cddb811f685704cb46dfed784fdf3affbce114ca`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 161–178.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def abelianizeAdj : abelianize ⊣ forget₂ CommGroupCat.{u} GroupCat.{u} :=
  Adjunction.mkOfHomEquiv
    { homEquiv := fun G A => Abelianization.lift.symm
      -- Porting note: used to be just `by intros; ext1; rfl`.
      homEquiv_naturality_left_symm := by
        intros
        ext1
        simp only [Equiv.symm_symm]
        apply Eq.symm
        apply Abelianization.lift.unique
        intros
        apply Abelianization.lift.of }
#align abelianize_adj abelianizeAdj

end Abelianization

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Adjunctions/Variant3a9c2e598ec74cdda8a894a0671d79e94e98bb77a147839464f2b26698a28947.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Adjunctions/Variant3a9c2e598ec74cdda8a894a0671d79e94e98bb77a147839464f2b26698a28947.lean#L161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0b60721f1c7d4e5871d0fcd43e9b82b6ba6fd8bd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
