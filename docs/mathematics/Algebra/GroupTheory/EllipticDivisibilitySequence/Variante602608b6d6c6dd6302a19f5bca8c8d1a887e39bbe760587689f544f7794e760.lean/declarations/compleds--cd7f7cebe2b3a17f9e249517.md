## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f616658fdd160828e48138807dbdfe568bcaa2c02fb068f955ec08691704ed60`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 665–674.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def complEDS' : ℕ → R
  | 0 => 0
  | 1 => 1
  | (n + 2) => let m := n / 2 + 1
    if hn : Even n then complEDS' m * complEDS₂ b c d (m * k) else
      have : m + 1 < n + 2 := by grind
      complEDS' m ^ 2 * normEDS b c d ((m + 1) * k + 1) * normEDS b c d ((m + 1) * k - 1) -
        complEDS' (m + 1) ^ 2 * normEDS b c d (m * k + 1) * normEDS b c d (m * k - 1)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/EllipticDivisibilitySequence/Variante602608b6d6c6dd6302a19f5bca8c8d1a887e39bbe760587689f544f7794e760.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/EllipticDivisibilitySequence/Variante602608b6d6c6dd6302a19f5bca8c8d1a887e39bbe760587689f544f7794e760.lean#L665).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `55bbcc13176509aad0892de50f1c9877b744dd64` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
