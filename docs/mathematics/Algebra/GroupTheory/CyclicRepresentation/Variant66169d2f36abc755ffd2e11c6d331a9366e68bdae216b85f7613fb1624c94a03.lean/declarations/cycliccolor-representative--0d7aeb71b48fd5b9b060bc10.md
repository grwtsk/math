## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:46926ea5-a8fb-ce2c-26c5-1ccc486a2f83`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–113.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cyclicColor_representative (x y : ZMod M) (r : ℕ)
    (hr : (r : ZMod M) = x - y) :
    ((cyclicColor x y : Divisor M) : ℕ) = M / Nat.gcd M r := by
  change addOrderOf (x - y) = _
  rw [← hr, ZMod.addOrderOf_coe _ (NeZero.ne M)]

/-- Two representatives of the same difference give the same numerical principal color. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/CyclicRepresentation/Variant66169d2f36abc755ffd2e11c6d331a9366e68bdae216b85f7613fb1624c94a03.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/CyclicRepresentation/Variant66169d2f36abc755ffd2e11c6d331a9366e68bdae216b85f7613fb1624c94a03.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `488e6006e33deb20ef2f3e4cdc545455e24f57a9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
