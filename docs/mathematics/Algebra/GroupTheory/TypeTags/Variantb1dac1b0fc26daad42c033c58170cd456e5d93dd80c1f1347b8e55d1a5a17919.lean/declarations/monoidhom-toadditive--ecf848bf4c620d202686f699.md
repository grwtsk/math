## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2fe31c9e1add850643bf9e397e27a3375183c5f5f2789790843588512580ec2a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 498–510.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def MonoidHom.toAdditive'' [AddZeroClass α] [MulOneClass β] :
    (Multiplicative α →* β) ≃ (α →+ Additive β) :=
  AddMonoidHom.toMultiplicative''.symm
#align monoid_hom.to_additive'' MonoidHom.toAdditive''
#align monoid_hom.to_additive''_symm_apply_apply MonoidHom.toAdditive''_symm_apply_apply
#align monoid_hom.to_additive''_apply_apply MonoidHom.toAdditive''_apply_apply

/-- If `α` has some multiplicative structure and coerces to a function,
then `Additive α` should also coerce to the same function.

This allows `Additive` to be used on bundled function types with a multiplicative structure, which
is often used for composition, without affecting the behavior of the function itself.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/TypeTags/Variantb1dac1b0fc26daad42c033c58170cd456e5d93dd80c1f1347b8e55d1a5a17919.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/TypeTags/Variantb1dac1b0fc26daad42c033c58170cd456e5d93dd80c1f1347b8e55d1a5a17919.lean#L498).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fc94c39e9852ca73cd58f4dea92129b23a45ce3a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
