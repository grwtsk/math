## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f2c68ffc-7a02-2065-8eaf-52a1309c0f1f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 329–335.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hostile_edges_noncommute : ¬ Commute hostileUpper hostileLower := by
  intro h
  have he := congrArg
    (fun g : (Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℚ)ˣ => (g : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℚ) 0 0) h.eq
  norm_num [hostileUpper, hostileLower, Matrix.mul_apply, Fin.sum_univ_two] at he

/-- The canonical sign flip is involutive, so its inverse is itself. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/FiniteCommonJTransport/Variantb9e73482274e9129072ffe566c3398086dfbe2deca1f3cd88d042ac4e751d415.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/FiniteCommonJTransport/Variantb9e73482274e9129072ffe566c3398086dfbe2deca1f3cd88d042ac4e751d415.lean#L329).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `23eb42b83bf307c454f4a1811c2ef5aa4e74dc04` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
