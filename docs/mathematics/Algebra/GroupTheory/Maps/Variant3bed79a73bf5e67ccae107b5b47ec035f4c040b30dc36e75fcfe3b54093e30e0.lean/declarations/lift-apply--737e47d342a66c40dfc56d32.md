## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b3066902-93b2-cb21-2f31-555854479702`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma lift_apply (z) :
    f.lift hg z = g (f.sec z).1 * (IsUnit.liftRight (g.domRestrict S) hg (f.sec z).2)⁻¹ :=
  rfl

/-- Given a Localization map `f : M →* N` for a Submonoid `S ⊆ M` and a map of `CommMonoid`s
`g : M →* P` such that `g y` is invertible for all `y : S`, the homomorphism induced from
`N` to `P` maps `f x * (f y)⁻¹` to `g x * (g y)⁻¹` for all `x : M, y ∈ S`. -/

/-- Given a Localization map `f : M →+ N` for an AddSubmonoid `S ⊆ M` and a map of
`AddCommMonoid`s `g : M →+ P` such that `g y` is invertible for all `y : S`, the homomorphism
induced from `N` to `P` maps `f x - f y` to `g x - g y` for all `x : M, y ∈ S`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Maps/Variant3bed79a73bf5e67ccae107b5b47ec035f4c040b30dc36e75fcfe3b54093e30e0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Maps/Variant3bed79a73bf5e67ccae107b5b47ec035f4c040b30dc36e75fcfe3b54093e30e0.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f824c934d876e50d5677fbd751bb1c1be8b562a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
