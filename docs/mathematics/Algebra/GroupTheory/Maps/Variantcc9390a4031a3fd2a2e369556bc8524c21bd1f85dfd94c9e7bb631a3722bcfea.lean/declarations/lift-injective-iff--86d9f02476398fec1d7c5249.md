## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c8e28fc2-1c8d-e619-36d7-7cd9bb312519`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–271.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

`g(S) ⊆ T`, the induced Monoid homomorphism from the Localization of `M` at `S` to the
Localization of `P` at `T`: if `f : M →* N` and `k : P →* Q` are Localization maps for `S` and
`T` respectively, we send `z : N` to `k (g x) * (k (g y))⁻¹`, where `(x, y) : M × S` are such
that `z = f x * (f y)⁻¹`. -/

Localization of `P` at `T`: if `f : M →+ N` and `k : P →+ Q` are Localization maps for `S` and
`T` respectively, we send `z : N` to `k (g x) - k (g y)`, where `(x, y) : M × S` are such

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Maps/Variantcc9390a4031a3fd2a2e369556bc8524c21bd1f85dfd94c9e7bb631a3722bcfea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Maps/Variantcc9390a4031a3fd2a2e369556bc8524c21bd1f85dfd94c9e7bb631a3722bcfea.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fdcac8f4fe54684f8d660b4cb435d4d125082abd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
