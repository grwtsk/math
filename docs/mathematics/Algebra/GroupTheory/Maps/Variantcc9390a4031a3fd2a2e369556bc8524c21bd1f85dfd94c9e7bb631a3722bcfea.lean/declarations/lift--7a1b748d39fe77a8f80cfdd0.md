## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bc372c34db889656ab7717beced864de805dc4606930a0f275b45708a4648486`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 80–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def lift : N →* P where
  toFun z := g (f.sec z).1 * (IsUnit.liftRight (g.domRestrict S) hg (f.sec z).2)⁻¹
  map_one' := by rw [mul_inv_left, mul_one]; exact f.eq_of_eq hg (by rw [← sec_spec, one_mul])
  map_mul' x y := by
    rw [mul_inv_left hg, ← mul_assoc, ← mul_assoc, mul_inv_right hg, mul_comm _ (g (f.sec y).1), ←
      mul_assoc, ← mul_assoc, mul_inv_right hg]
    repeat rw [← g.map_mul]
    refine f.eq_of_eq hg ?_

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Maps/Variantcc9390a4031a3fd2a2e369556bc8524c21bd1f85dfd94c9e7bb631a3722bcfea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Maps/Variantcc9390a4031a3fd2a2e369556bc8524c21bd1f85dfd94c9e7bb631a3722bcfea.lean#L80).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fdcac8f4fe54684f8d660b4cb435d4d125082abd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
