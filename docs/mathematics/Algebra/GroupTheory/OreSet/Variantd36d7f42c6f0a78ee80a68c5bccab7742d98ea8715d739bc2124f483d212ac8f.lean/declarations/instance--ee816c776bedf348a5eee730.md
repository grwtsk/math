## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:095ac9a7f6d75e71978235b3a2bdfcc37fc5af60dd2cfeb43d081e0f34b2ba5a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 121–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) oreSetComm {R} [CommMonoid R] (S : Submonoid R) : OreSet S where
  ore_right_cancel m n s h := ⟨s, by rw [mul_comm (s : R) n, mul_comm (s : R) m, h]⟩
  oreNum r _ := r
  oreDenom _ s := s
  ore_eq r s := by rw [mul_comm]

@[to_additive (attr := simp) AddOreLocalization.addOreSetComm_oreMin]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/OreSet/Variantd36d7f42c6f0a78ee80a68c5bccab7742d98ea8715d739bc2124f483d212ac8f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/OreSet/Variantd36d7f42c6f0a78ee80a68c5bccab7742d98ea8715d739bc2124f483d212ac8f.lean#L121).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8e11df203543567be6144419be45c780087ea5ed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
