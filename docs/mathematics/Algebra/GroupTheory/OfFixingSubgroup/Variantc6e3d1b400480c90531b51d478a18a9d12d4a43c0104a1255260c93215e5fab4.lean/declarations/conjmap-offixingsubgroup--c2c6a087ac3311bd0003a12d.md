## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6b7c5527871f0e07c68ddddd47937085ef6e050f7ef2145cfe35d9e12751ce99`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 274–287.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def conjMap_ofFixingSubgroup (hg : g • t = s) :
    ofFixingSubgroup M t →ₑ[fixingSubgroupEquivFixingSubgroup hg] ofFixingSubgroup M s where
  toFun := fun ⟨x, hx⟩ =>
    ⟨g • x, by
      intro hgxt; apply hx
      rw [← hg] at hgxt
      exact Set.smul_mem_smul_set_iff.mp hgxt⟩

      MulAut.conj_apply, mul_smul, inv_smul_smul]

@[to_additive (attr := simp)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/OfFixingSubgroup/Variantc6e3d1b400480c90531b51d478a18a9d12d4a43c0104a1255260c93215e5fab4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/OfFixingSubgroup/Variantc6e3d1b400480c90531b51d478a18a9d12d4a43c0104a1255260c93215e5fab4.lean#L274).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d17cebbd1ad711b2841d05d79ff69b9818206f9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
