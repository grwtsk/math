## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:afe09ecae707cdee5d41a142bdd562ae0306af1605b9817c1978132c56850e6f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 176–191.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def fixingSubgroupInsertEquiv (a : α) (s : Set (ofStabilizer M a)) :
    fixingSubgroup M (insert a (Subtype.val '' s)) ≃* fixingSubgroup (stabilizer M a) s where
  toFun m := ⟨⟨(m : M), (mem_fixingSubgroup_iff M).mp m.prop a (Set.mem_insert _ _)⟩,
      fun ⟨x, hx⟩ => by
        simp only [← SetLike.coe_eq_coe]
        refine (mem_fixingSubgroup_iff M).mp m.prop _ (Set.mem_insert_of_mem a ?_)
        exact ⟨⟨x, (SubMulAction.mem_ofStabilizer_iff  M a).mp x.prop⟩, hx, rfl⟩⟩
  map_mul' _ _ := by simp [← Subtype.coe_inj]
  invFun m := ⟨m, by simp [fixingSubgroup_of_insert]⟩
  left_inv _ := by simp
  right_inv _ := by simp

/-- The identity map of fixing subgroup of stabilizer
into the fixing subgroup of the extended set, as an equivariant map. -/
@[to_additive /-- The identity map of fixing additive subgroup of stabilizer
into the fixing additive subgroup of the extended set, as an equivariant map. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/OfFixingSubgroup/Variantc6e3d1b400480c90531b51d478a18a9d12d4a43c0104a1255260c93215e5fab4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/OfFixingSubgroup/Variantc6e3d1b400480c90531b51d478a18a9d12d4a43c0104a1255260c93215e5fab4.lean#L176).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d17cebbd1ad711b2841d05d79ff69b9818206f9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
