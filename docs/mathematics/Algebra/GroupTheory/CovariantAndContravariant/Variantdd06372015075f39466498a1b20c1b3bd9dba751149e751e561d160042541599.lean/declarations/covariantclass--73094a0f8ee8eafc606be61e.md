## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a3b1ce2e7881981ede30d8f1f4106674418a519ad37f3904bd2fb2eb32b21c7a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 110–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class CovariantClass : Prop where
  /-- For all `m ∈ M` and all elements `n₁, n₂ ∈ N`, if the relation `r` holds for the pair
  `(n₁, n₂)`, then, the relation `r` also holds for the pair `(μ m n₁, μ m n₂)` -/
  protected elim : Covariant M N μ r
#align covariant_class CovariantClass

/-- Given an action `μ` of a Type `M` on a Type `N` and a relation `r` on `N`, informally, the
`ContravariantClass` says that "if the result of the action `μ` on a pair satisfies the
relation `r`, then the initial pair satisfied the relation `r`."

More precisely, the `ContravariantClass` is a class taking two Types `M N`, together with an
"action" `μ : M → N → N` and a relation `r : N → N → Prop`.  Its unique field `elim` is the
assertion that for all `m ∈ M` and all elements `n₁, n₂ ∈ N`, if the relation `r` holds for the
pair `(μ m n₁, μ m n₂)` obtained from `(n₁, n₂)` by acting upon it by `m`, then, the relation
`r` also holds for the pair `(n₁, n₂)`.

If `m : M` and `h : r (μ m n₁) (μ m n₂)`, then `ContravariantClass.elim m h : r n₁ n₂`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/CovariantAndContravariant/Variantdd06372015075f39466498a1b20c1b3bd9dba751149e751e561d160042541599.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/CovariantAndContravariant/Variantdd06372015075f39466498a1b20c1b3bd9dba751149e751e561d160042541599.lean#L110).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f29a5fe8424ff089bcf6b290f3e419dd42b7e30` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
