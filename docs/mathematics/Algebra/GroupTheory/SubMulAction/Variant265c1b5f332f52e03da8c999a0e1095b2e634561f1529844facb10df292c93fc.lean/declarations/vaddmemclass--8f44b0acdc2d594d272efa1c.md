## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4d7463ae86ba163767a7446cdf5615dbbbb263a8eb805bf7e9137c228f576f84`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 70–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class VAddMemClass (S : Type*) (R : outParam Type*) (M : Type*) [VAdd R M] [SetLike S M] :
    Prop where
  /-- Addition by a scalar with an element of the set remains in the set. -/
  vadd_mem : ∀ {s : S} (r : R) {m : M}, m ∈ s → r +ᵥ m ∈ s

attribute [to_additive] SMulMemClass

attribute [aesop 90% (rule_sets := [SetLike])] SMulMemClass.smul_mem VAddMemClass.vadd_mem

/-- Not registered as an instance because `R` is an `outParam` in `SMulMemClass S R M`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/SubMulAction/Variant265c1b5f332f52e03da8c999a0e1095b2e634561f1529844facb10df292c93fc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/SubMulAction/Variant265c1b5f332f52e03da8c999a0e1095b2e634561f1529844facb10df292c93fc.lean#L70).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d049158fe1f7259eabec286d2b7607675cb0fab` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
