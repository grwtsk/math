## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:29199706131e8d2422be28a6386a0f81a685e7522914a07a165465cabdd6b0ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure SubMulAction (R : Type u) (M : Type v) [SMul R M] : Type v where
  /-- The underlying set of a `SubMulAction`. -/
  carrier : Set M
  /-- The carrier set is closed under scalar multiplication. -/
  smul_mem' : ∀ (c : R) {x : M}, x ∈ carrier → c • x ∈ carrier
#align sub_mul_action SubMulAction

namespace SubMulAction

variable [SMul R M]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/SubMulAction/Variant0cdbddbfb332373b13669bd0b32f41a703d990b52cd7af41136aa6706925b457.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/SubMulAction/Variant0cdbddbfb332373b13669bd0b32f41a703d990b52cd7af41136aa6706925b457.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fda4f378edba50c35e4f82e1186764443b8650e0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
