## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e459d752626235aedd1c9d2aa589367b7fb19dd2977dadb881d0497947e5f92b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev Group.ofLeftAxioms {G : Type u} [Mul G] [Inv G] [One G]
    (assoc : ∀ a b c : G, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c))
    (one_mul : ∀ a : G, 1 * a = a)
    (inv_mul_cancel : ∀ a : G, a⁻¹ * a = 1) : Group G :=
  { mul_assoc := assoc,
    one_mul := one_mul,
    inv_mul_cancel := inv_mul_cancel,
    mul_one := fun a => by
      have mul_inv_cancel : ∀ a : G, a * a⁻¹ = 1 := fun a =>
        calc a * a⁻¹ = 1 * (a * a⁻¹) := (one_mul _).symm
          _ = ((a * a⁻¹)⁻¹ * (a * a⁻¹)) * (a * a⁻¹) := by
            rw [inv_mul_cancel]
          _ = (a * a⁻¹)⁻¹ * (a * ((a⁻¹ * a) * a⁻¹)) := by
            simp only [assoc]
          _ = 1 := by
            rw [inv_mul_cancel, one_mul, inv_mul_cancel]
      rw [← inv_mul_cancel a, ← assoc, mul_inv_cancel a, one_mul] }

/-- Define a `Group` structure on a Type by proving `∀ a, a * 1 = a` and
`∀ a, a * a⁻¹ = 1`.
Note that this uses the default definitions for `npow`, `zpow` and `div`.
See note [reducible non-instances]. -/

"Define an `AddGroup` structure on a Type by proving `∀ a, a + 0 = a` and
`∀ a, a + -a = 0`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/MinimalAxioms/Variant5e3d76a4a28063bb6ae7a15f235b46688ef03f94c30a503479cdb2b2561c8e30.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/MinimalAxioms/Variant5e3d76a4a28063bb6ae7a15f235b46688ef03f94c30a503479cdb2b2561c8e30.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bf3c3f96838856efa6def5f051700cc203e905ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
