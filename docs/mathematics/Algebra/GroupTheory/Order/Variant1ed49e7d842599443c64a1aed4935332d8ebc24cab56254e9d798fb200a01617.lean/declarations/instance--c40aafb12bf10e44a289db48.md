## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5afbc813db0740fc987a762db267333b51b4bca8fd32475b382d17838aa96dc1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 36–50.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : IsModularLattice (Subgroup C) :=
  ⟨fun {x} y z xz a ha => by
    rw [mem_inf, mem_sup] at ha
    rcases ha with ⟨⟨b, hb, c, hc, rfl⟩, haz⟩
    rw [mem_sup]
    exact ⟨b, hb, c, mem_inf.2 ⟨hc, (mul_mem_cancel_left (xz hb)).1 haz⟩, rfl⟩⟩

end ModularLattice

section Coatom
namespace Subgroup

variable {G : Type*} [Group G] (H : Subgroup G)

/-- In a group that satisfies the normalizer condition, every maximal subgroup is normal -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Order/Variant1ed49e7d842599443c64a1aed4935332d8ebc24cab56254e9d798fb200a01617.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Order/Variant1ed49e7d842599443c64a1aed4935332d8ebc24cab56254e9d798fb200a01617.lean#L36).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `41b3e8577042d3a8524f6060088da8b056a89460` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
