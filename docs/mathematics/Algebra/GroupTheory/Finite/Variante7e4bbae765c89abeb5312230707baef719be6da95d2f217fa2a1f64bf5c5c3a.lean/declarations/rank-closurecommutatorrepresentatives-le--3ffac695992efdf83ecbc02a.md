## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:43e80c4c-62cb-8192-3994-3800d78ac434`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–109.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma rank_closureCommutatorRepresentatives_le :
    Group.rank (closureCommutatorRepresentatives G) ≤ 2 * Nat.card (commutatorSet G) := by
  rw [two_mul]
  exact
    (Subgroup.rank_closure_finite_le_nat_card _).trans
      ((Set.card_union_le _ _).trans
        (add_le_add ((Finite.card_image_le _).trans (Finite.card_range_le _))
          ((Finite.card_image_le _).trans (Finite.card_range_le _))))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Finite/Variante7e4bbae765c89abeb5312230707baef719be6da95d2f217fa2a1f64bf5c5c3a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Finite/Variante7e4bbae765c89abeb5312230707baef719be6da95d2f217fa2a1f64bf5c5c3a.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ce5e5695fc1e066150fb8a4d6399ad4d57cbc4b8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
