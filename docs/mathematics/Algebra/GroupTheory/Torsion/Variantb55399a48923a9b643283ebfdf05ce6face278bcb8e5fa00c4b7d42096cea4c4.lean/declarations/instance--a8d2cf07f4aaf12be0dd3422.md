## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7908d5fef076484c8bd630007eb97ca5b0fd224c410815fc139c692f15f5c44d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 445–457.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {R M : Type*} [Ring R] [AddCommGroup M] [Module R M] :
    Module R (M ⧸ AddCommGroup.torsion M) :=
  letI : Submodule R M := { AddCommGroup.torsion M with smul_mem' := fun r m ⟨n, hn, hn'⟩ ↦
    ⟨n, hn, by { simp only [Function.IsPeriodicPt, Function.IsFixedPt, add_left_iterate, add_zero,
      Nat.isUnit_iff, smul_comm n] at hn' ⊢; simp only [hn', smul_zero] }⟩ }
  inferInstanceAs (Module R (M ⧸ this))

end AddCommGroup

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Torsion/Variantb55399a48923a9b643283ebfdf05ce6face278bcb8e5fa00c4b7d42096cea4c4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Torsion/Variantb55399a48923a9b643283ebfdf05ce6face278bcb8e5fa00c4b7d42096cea4c4.lean#L445).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `49a039de16c3052a309ddaf001f9d87bc151477a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
