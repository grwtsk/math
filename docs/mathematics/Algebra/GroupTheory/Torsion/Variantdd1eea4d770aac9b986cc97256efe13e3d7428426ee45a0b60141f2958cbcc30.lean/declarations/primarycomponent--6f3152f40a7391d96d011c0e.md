## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5a1505c2e4a364d496f6412ab38ac636afa64c29ce11a509c363af30d3f66bcb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 210–226.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def primaryComponent : Submonoid G where
  carrier := { g | ∃ n : ℕ, orderOf g = p ^ n }
  one_mem' := ⟨0, by rw [pow_zero, orderOf_one]⟩
  mul_mem' hg₁ hg₂ :=
    exists_orderOf_eq_prime_pow_iff.mpr <| by
      obtain ⟨m, hm⟩ := exists_orderOf_eq_prime_pow_iff.mp hg₁
      obtain ⟨n, hn⟩ := exists_orderOf_eq_prime_pow_iff.mp hg₂
      exact
        ⟨m + n, by
          rw [mul_pow, pow_add, pow_mul, hm, one_pow, Monoid.one_mul, mul_comm, pow_mul, hn,
            one_pow]⟩

variable {G} {p}

/-- Elements of the `p`-primary component have order `p^n` for some `n`. -/
@[to_additive primaryComponent.exists_orderOf_eq_prime_nsmul
  "Elements of the `p`-primary component have additive order `p^n` for some `n`"]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Torsion/Variantdd1eea4d770aac9b986cc97256efe13e3d7428426ee45a0b60141f2958cbcc30.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Torsion/Variantdd1eea4d770aac9b986cc97256efe13e3d7428426ee45a0b60141f2958cbcc30.lean#L210).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `31cb5ce84d4edc5b1ce6323731dbad06571835d2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
