## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:41356ab5-1193-ec82-6d8f-ebc00b440664`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 391–400.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsTorsion.not_torsion_free [hN : Nontrivial G] : IsTorsion G → ¬IsTorsionFree G := fun tG =>
  (not_isTorsionFree_iff _).mpr <| by
    obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := (nontrivial_iff_exists_ne (1 : G)).mp hN
    exact ⟨x, hx, tG x⟩
#align is_torsion.not_torsion_free IsTorsion.not_torsion_free
#align add_monoid.is_torsion.not_torsion_free AddMonoid.IsTorsion.not_torsion_free

/-- A nontrivial torsion-free group is not torsion. -/
@[to_additive AddMonoid.IsTorsionFree.not_torsion
      "A nontrivial torsion-free additive group is not torsion."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Torsion/Variant6f17609e752c55078b3bcad7ec6453f9b0e7e572b19df2b475bde1c288978c1e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Torsion/Variant6f17609e752c55078b3bcad7ec6453f9b0e7e572b19df2b475bde1c288978c1e.lean#L391).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ff6ecc826d006a3b01995485c20948ad84f091da` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
