## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6d82d8ba387e3e8337b650ea0f9e7a253a2d6ad5dd4c9f81d0e3fe6c10960a7e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 415–424.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def comapSubgroup (f : G ≃* H) : Subgroup H ≃o Subgroup G where
  toFun := Subgroup.comap f
  invFun := Subgroup.comap f.symm
  left_inv sg := by simp [Subgroup.comap_comap]
  right_inv sh := by simp [Subgroup.comap_comap]
  map_rel_iff' {sg1 sg2} :=
    ⟨fun h => by simpa [Subgroup.comap_comap] using
      Subgroup.comap_mono (f := (f.symm : H →* G)) h, Subgroup.comap_mono⟩

@[to_additive (attr := simp, norm_cast)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Map/Variantd5e61aca984631a557ab7e205f58b6bb56e1557fb3cfac07447a1e17ca4612fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Map/Variantd5e61aca984631a557ab7e205f58b6bb56e1557fb3cfac07447a1e17ca4612fb.lean#L415).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c5c05a34a4f0db8afd73bc04fe2a842fba28dd7c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
