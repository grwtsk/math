## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d5db05e8-0378-7ad7-2791-1b82e999f8e1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 721–745.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem subsingleton_of_card_lt [Finite X] (hB : IsBlock G B)
    (hB' : Nat.card X < 2 * Set.ncard (orbit G B)) :
    B.Subsingleton := by
  suffices Set.ncard B < 2 by
    rw [Nat.lt_succ_iff, Set.ncard_le_one_iff_eq] at this
    cases this with
    | inl h => rw [h]; exact Set.subsingleton_empty
    | inr h =>
      obtain ⟨a, ha⟩ := h; rw [ha]; exact Set.subsingleton_singleton
  cases Set.eq_empty_or_nonempty B with
  | inl h => rw [h, Set.ncard_empty]; norm_num
  | inr h =>
    rw [← hB.ncard_block_mul_ncard_orbit_eq h, lt_iff_not_ge] at hB'
    rw [← not_le]
    exact fun hb ↦ hB' (Nat.mul_le_mul_right _ hb)

/- The assumption `B.Finite` is necessary :
  For G = ℤ acting on itself, a = 0 and B = ℕ, the translates `k • B` of the statement
  are just `k + ℕ`, for `k ≤ 0`, and the corresponding intersection is `ℕ`, which is not a block.
  (Remark by Thomas Browning) -/
/-- The intersection of the translates of a *finite* subset which contain a given point
is a block (Wielandt, th. 7.3). -/

  "The intersection of the translates of a *finite* subset which contain a given point
  is a block (Wielandt, th. 7.3)."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Blocks/Variantcfbccf611b26e2040bbfd661bd50d20eacec53b2d07ed92f29cf864da9e64bd9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Blocks/Variantcfbccf611b26e2040bbfd661bd50d20eacec53b2d07ed92f29cf864da9e64bd9.lean#L721).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bca0d1f038cd60072528a4a505ef572dad1f7c78` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
