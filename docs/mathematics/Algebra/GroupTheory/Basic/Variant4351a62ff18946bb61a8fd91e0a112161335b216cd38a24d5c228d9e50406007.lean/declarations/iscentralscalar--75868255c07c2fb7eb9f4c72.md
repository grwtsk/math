## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:440ca3de030f397808677c57c99bbe10fe468437b5657eb8786efe7faa150caa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 173–181.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isCentralScalar [SMul α β] [SMul αᵐᵒᵖ β] [IsCentralScalar α β] :
    IsCentralScalar α (Set β) :=
  ⟨fun _ S ↦ (congr_arg fun f ↦ f '' S) <| funext fun _ ↦ op_smul_eq_smul _ _⟩

/-- A multiplicative action of a monoid `α` on a type `β` gives a multiplicative action of `Set α`
on `Set β`. -/
@[to_additive (attr := instance_reducible)
/-- An additive action of an additive monoid `α` on a type `β` gives an additive action of `Set α`
on `Set β` -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant4351a62ff18946bb61a8fd91e0a112161335b216cd38a24d5c228d9e50406007.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant4351a62ff18946bb61a8fd91e0a112161335b216cd38a24d5c228d9e50406007.lean#L173).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `05732c151599b59968fc91e41b7cbd73679b41f9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
