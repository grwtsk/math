## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9305137a8a288350cba7e78eb5d8165603df3bb092e4cb54d3e209ba025ca3ba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 683–695.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofClosureMEqTopRight {M N} [Monoid M] [Monoid N] {s : Set M} (f : M → N) (hs : closure s = ⊤)
    (h1 : f 1 = 1) (hmul : ∀ (x), ∀ y ∈ s, f (x * y) = f x * f y) :
    M →* N where
  toFun := f
  map_one' := h1
  map_mul' x y :=
    dense_induction y hs (fun y hy x => hmul x y hy) (by simp [h1])
      (fun y₁ y₂ (h₁ : ∀ x, f _ = f _ * f _) (h₂ : ∀ x, f _ = f _ * f _) x => by
        simp [← mul_assoc, h₁, h₂]) x
#align monoid_hom.of_mclosure_eq_top_right MonoidHom.ofClosureMEqTopRight
#align add_monoid_hom.of_mclosure_eq_top_right AddMonoidHom.ofClosureMEqTopRight

@[to_additive (attr := simp, norm_cast)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantfaba35514011cdd0195dcb78d1a9c55d3c0fa6683a0ae41b64370f2235dcc871.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantfaba35514011cdd0195dcb78d1a9c55d3c0fa6683a0ae41b64370f2235dcc871.lean#L683).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bb805314b089ae9ce7ec0d495934bfcc536ed723` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
