## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cd48ec90-cce9-04e4-c748-8e01f671737a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 365–371.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma smul_graphOn (x : α × β) (s : Set α) (f : F) :
    x • s.graphOn f = (x.1 • s).graphOn fun a ↦ x.2 / f x.1 * f a := by
  ext ⟨a, b⟩
  simp [mem_smul_set_iff_inv_smul_mem, Prod.ext_iff, and_comm (a := _ = a), inv_mul_eq_iff_eq_mul,
    mul_left_comm _ _⁻¹, eq_inv_mul_iff_mul_eq, ← mul_div_right_comm, div_eq_iff_eq_mul, mul_comm b]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant9dda5df265916139275e0e1647d89c6328c7039728fd033e27e81b06421561b0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant9dda5df265916139275e0e1647d89c6328c7039728fd033e27e81b06421561b0.lean#L365).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d87c97b981e9fa090aacc97a6872c76da16a9b02` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
