## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4903825c-1d23-adfb-a76f-d1397c83eab3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1332–1348.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cmp_mul_right' {α : Type*} [Mul α] [LinearOrder α]
    [MulRightStrictMono α] (a b c : α) :
    cmp (a * c) (b * c) = cmp a b :=
  (strictMono_id.mul_const' c).cmp_map_eq a b

end Mono

/-- An element `a : α` is `MulLECancellable` if `x ↦ a * x` is order-reflecting.
We will make a separate version of many lemmas that require `[MulLeftReflectLE α]` with
`MulLECancellable` assumptions instead. These lemmas can then be instantiated to specific types,
like `ENNReal`, where we can replace the assumption `AddLECancellable x` by `x ≠ ∞`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant3c9eec32897853178e038b0180842511e6712407b8a7ba2ce6ff927ab5eccebe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant3c9eec32897853178e038b0180842511e6712407b8a7ba2ce6ff927ab5eccebe.lean#L1332).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e722d92759efb3e913231e31de2d2e8d8e3cd5b3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
