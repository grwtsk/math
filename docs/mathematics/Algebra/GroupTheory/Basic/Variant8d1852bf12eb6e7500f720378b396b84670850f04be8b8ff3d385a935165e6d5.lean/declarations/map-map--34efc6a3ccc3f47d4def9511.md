## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:31075e3a-ee11-ed90-85a2-06bf104b794d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 332–345.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_map {M'' N''} [MulOneClass M''] [MulOneClass N''] (f' : M' →* M'') (g' : N' →* N'')
    (f : M →* M') (g : N →* N') (x : M ∗ N) :
    map f' g' (map f g x) = map (f'.comp f) (g'.comp g) x :=
  DFunLike.congr_fun (map_comp_map f' g' f g) x

variable (M N)

/-- Map `M ∗ N` to `N ∗ M` by applying `Sum.swap` to each element of the underlying list.

See also `MulEquiv.coprodComm` for a `MulEquiv` version. -/

  by applying `Sum.swap` to each element of the underlying list.

See also `AddEquiv.coprodComm` for an `AddEquiv` version."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant8d1852bf12eb6e7500f720378b396b84670850f04be8b8ff3d385a935165e6d5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant8d1852bf12eb6e7500f720378b396b84670850f04be8b8ff3d385a935165e6d5.lean#L332).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `89b6a0a71b0943a43266b42849e9d28bef10283b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
