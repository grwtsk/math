## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cacd6a97106534b9efd2cac95f2b63a63da12dd8f04ab37a81512bbcb97424df`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 290–305.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def subrepresentation (W : Submodule k V) (le_comap : ∀ g, W ≤ W.comap (ρ g)) :
    Representation k G W where
  toFun g := (ρ g).restrict <| le_comap g
  map_one' := by ext; simp
  map_mul' _ _ := by ext; simp

end Subrepresentation

section Quotient

variable {k G V : Type*} [CommRing k] [Monoid G] [AddCommGroup V] [Module k V]
  (ρ : Representation k G V)

/-- Given a `k`-linear `G`-representation `(V, ρ)` and a `G`-invariant `k`-submodule `W ≤ V`, this
is the representation induced on `V ⧸ W` by `ρ`. -/
@[simps]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant5e550c77165d01bf9628bf3f294997191d20f03f29ec76c405e05465bf8f0275.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant5e550c77165d01bf9628bf3f294997191d20f03f29ec76c405e05465bf8f0275.lean#L290).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cdb9c1ad70d67f6b3713aa00810fe38e40fd7be9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
