## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a740f255-8490-dc73-f169-d9f4a16994c9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 420–430.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ofMulAction_apply {H : Type*} [MulAction G H] (g : G) (f : H →₀ k) (h : H) :
    ofMulAction k G H g f h = f (g⁻¹ • h) := by
  conv_lhs => rw [← smul_inv_smul g h]
  let h' := g⁻¹ • h
  change ofMulAction k G H g f (g • h') = f h'
  have hg : Function.Injective (g • · : H → H) := by
    intro h₁ h₂
    simp
  simp only [ofMulAction_def, Finsupp.lmapDomain_apply, Finsupp.mapDomain_apply, hg]

-- Porting note: did not need this in ML3; noncomputable because IR check complains
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant5e550c77165d01bf9628bf3f294997191d20f03f29ec76c405e05465bf8f0275.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant5e550c77165d01bf9628bf3f294997191d20f03f29ec76c405e05465bf8f0275.lean#L420).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cdb9c1ad70d67f6b3713aa00810fe38e40fd7be9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
