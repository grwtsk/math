## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cb05c04b-eb2f-a314-0d0b-af9a20327a50`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 821–829.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Right.mul_lt_one_of_le_of_lt [MulRightMono α] {a b : α}
    (ha : a ≤ 1) (hb : b < 1) :
    a * b < 1 :=
  mul_lt_of_le_one_of_lt ha hb

/-- Assumes right covariance.
The lemma assuming left covariance is `Left.mul_lt_one`. -/
@[to_additive "Assumes right covariance.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant3a782703ef7e8f2885e00617b0a6c538928cf0f6d853c7df8be7710a88199c3c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant3a782703ef7e8f2885e00617b0a6c538928cf0f6d853c7df8be7710a88199c3c.lean#L821).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c79247af8abd686e70b1d7f728f592613865a84a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
