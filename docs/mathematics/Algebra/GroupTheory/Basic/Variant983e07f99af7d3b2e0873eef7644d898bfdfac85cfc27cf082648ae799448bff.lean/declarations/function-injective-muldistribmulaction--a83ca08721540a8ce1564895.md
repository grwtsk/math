## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:746bf7c2f22039c9e8ae654dd6fc2ebe8bf52df51f3830f56f67d408924a56cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 160–168.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected abbrev Function.Injective.mulDistribMulAction [Monoid B] [SMul M B] (f : B →* A)
    (hf : Injective f) (smul : ∀ (c : M) (x), f (c • x) = c • f x) : MulDistribMulAction M B where
  __ := hf.mulAction f smul
  smul_mul c x y := hf <| by simp only [smul, f.map_mul, smul_mul']
  smul_one c := hf <| by simp only [smul, f.map_one, smul_one]

homomorphism. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant983e07f99af7d3b2e0873eef7644d898bfdfac85cfc27cf082648ae799448bff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant983e07f99af7d3b2e0873eef7644d898bfdfac85cfc27cf082648ae799448bff.lean#L160).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1cb2021723b128e75748f0c58e85674d52f3c640` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
