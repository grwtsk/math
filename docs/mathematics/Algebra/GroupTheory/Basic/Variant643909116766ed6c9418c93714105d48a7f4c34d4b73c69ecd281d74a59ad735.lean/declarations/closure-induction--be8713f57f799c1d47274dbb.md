## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:92cf85b0-6257-a490-fb14-6a4a160ee21b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 161–178.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (mem : ∀ (x) (y) (hx : x ∈ s) (hy : y ∈ s), p x y (subset_closure hx) (subset_closure hy))
    (mul_left : ∀ x y z hx hy hz, p x z hx hz → p y z hy hz → p (x * y) z (mul_mem hx hy) hz)
    (mul_right : ∀ x y z hx hy hz, p z x hz hx → p z y hz hy → p z (x * y) hz (mul_mem hx hy))

some predicate `p` holds for all `x : M` it suffices to verify `p x` for `x ∈ s`,
and verify that `p x` and `p y` imply `p (x * y)`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant643909116766ed6c9418c93714105d48a7f4c34d4b73c69ecd281d74a59ad735.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant643909116766ed6c9418c93714105d48a7f4c34d4b73c69ecd281d74a59ad735.lean#L161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2cafbc662b7ed9334484b2b0fe07eb0afc8772d8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
