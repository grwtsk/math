## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b09d9d0460fbe94fd9287503132ca8cef735c441acc5ae10b94bc251ab56d65a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1543–1557.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Subgroup.t3_quotient_of_isClosed (S : Subgroup G) [Subgroup.Normal S]
    [hS : IsClosed (S : Set G)] : T3Space (G ⧸ S) := by
  rw [← QuotientGroup.ker_mk' S] at hS
  haveI := TopologicalGroup.t1Space (G ⧸ S) (quotientMap_quotient_mk'.isClosed_preimage.mp hS)
  exact TopologicalGroup.t3Space _
#align subgroup.t3_quotient_of_is_closed Subgroup.t3_quotient_of_isClosed
#align add_subgroup.t3_quotient_of_is_closed AddSubgroup.t3_quotient_of_isClosed

/-- A subgroup `S` of a topological group `G` acts on `G` properly discontinuously on the left, if
it is discrete in the sense that `S ∩ K` is finite for all compact `K`. (See also
`DiscreteTopology`.) -/

  "A subgroup `S` of an additive topological group `G` acts on `G` properly
  discontinuously on the left, if it is discrete in the sense that `S ∩ K` is finite for all compact
  `K`. (See also `DiscreteTopology`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantba7af376cad08c06ec0654ebf2d22abb7604a5db49afa66cf7c9696abce04b3a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantba7af376cad08c06ec0654ebf2d22abb7604a5db49afa66cf7c9696abce04b3a.lean#L1543).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3d76f71efd3510cef483a2a09972884f71518245` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
