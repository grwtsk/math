## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:227d450522f2217b99f3ebb9544af8c201ce461078808e41546ce07d057beea0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 303–312.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def starRingAut : RingAut R := { starAddEquiv, starMulAut (R := R) with toFun := star }

variable (R) in
/-- `star` as a ring endomorphism, for commutative `R`. This is used to denote complex
conjugation, and is available under the notation `conj` in the locale `ComplexConjugate`.

Note that this is the preferred form (over `starRingAut`, available under the same hypotheses)
because the notation `E →ₗ⋆[R] F` for an `R`-conjugate-linear map (short for
`E →ₛₗ[starRingEnd R] F`) does not pretty-print if there is a coercion involved, as would be the
case for `(↑starRingAut : R →* R)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant2714e7698d7afab4ed2c440c4024282232c19902aea8e232580b279bd00e873d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant2714e7698d7afab4ed2c440c4024282232c19902aea8e232580b279bd00e873d.lean#L303).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `daa1ee79b8c17c654e843e574858bc4895e06d43` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
