## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9a36468f51c2a4b80caf9a717091d2a5ab7faa5a455f839fc3054de8e63c0346`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 412–434.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toEnd : (G →+c[a, a] G) →* Function.End G where
  toFun := DFunLike.coe
  map_mul' _ _ := rfl
  map_one' := rfl

end Add

section AddZeroClass

variable {G H K : Type*} [Add G] [AddZeroClass H] {a : G} {b : H}

### Multiplicative action on `(b : H) × (G →+c[a, b] H)`

If `K` acts distributively on `H`, then for each `f : G →+c[a, b] H`
we define `(AddConstMap.smul c f : G →+c[a, c • b] H)`.

One can show that this defines a multiplicative action of `K` on `(b : H) × (G →+c[a, b] H)`
but we don't do this at the moment because we don't need this.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant4ef80cb2e1c3ef1250c3a0ae76baf682eccd13f147e18ccde3f11bc33a25d832.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant4ef80cb2e1c3ef1250c3a0ae76baf682eccd13f147e18ccde3f11bc33a25d832.lean#L412).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ad209f02c2755c8e3d1f143f54e613dad4893a13` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
