## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:744e6cb8f468f0fe9986054bbc2e648d28483d4edb439846f88dc8f855029028`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 310–317.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def oreDivSMulChar' (r₁ : R) (r₂ : X) (s₁ s₂ : S) :
    Σ'r' : R, Σ's' : S, s' * r₁ = r' * s₂ ∧ (r₁ /ₒ s₁) • (r₂ /ₒ s₂) = r' • r₂ /ₒ (s' * s₁) :=
  ⟨oreNum r₁ s₂, oreDenom r₁ s₂, ore_eq r₁ s₂, oreDiv_smul_oreDiv⟩

/-- Another characterization lemma for the multiplication on the Ore localizaion delivering
Ore witnesses and conditions bundled in a sigma type. -/
@[to_additive "Another characterization lemma for the addition on the Ore localizaion delivering
  Ore witnesses and conditions bundled in a sigma type."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant2f586cb337873ac18361456b81b148cbfb3b61538f891776fdd898b30434303f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant2f586cb337873ac18361456b81b148cbfb3b61538f891776fdd898b30434303f.lean#L310).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cf44a79828b938c6400893f676e0b3c79e306139` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
