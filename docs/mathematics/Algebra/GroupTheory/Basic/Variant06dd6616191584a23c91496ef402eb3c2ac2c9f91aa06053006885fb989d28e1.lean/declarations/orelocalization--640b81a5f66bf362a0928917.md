## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c7e9e39dad949b450af7a671f3a1a3b1cc1fe8b727c177c4422d7eef70c1331a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 82–95.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def OreLocalization (R : Type*) [Monoid R] (S : Submonoid R) [OreSet S] :=
  Quotient (OreLocalization.oreEqv R S)
#align ore_localization OreLocalization

namespace OreLocalization

section Monoid

variable {R : Type*} [Monoid R] {S : Submonoid R}

variable (R S) [OreSet S]

@[inherit_doc OreLocalization]
scoped syntax:1075 term noWs atomic("[" term "⁻¹" noWs "]") : term
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant06dd6616191584a23c91496ef402eb3c2ac2c9f91aa06053006885fb989d28e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant06dd6616191584a23c91496ef402eb3c2ac2c9f91aa06053006885fb989d28e1.lean#L82).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6a06b433741f3b74838de3af4a9b25caefd68eda` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
