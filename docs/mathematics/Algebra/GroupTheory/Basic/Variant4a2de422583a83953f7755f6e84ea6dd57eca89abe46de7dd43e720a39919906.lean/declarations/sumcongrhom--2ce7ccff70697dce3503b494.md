## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fe31d1ab8b6c848abb98d1cc2834dced61230fc0da8ed77f47248ce70584d75b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 211–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sumCongrHom (α β : Type*) : Perm α × Perm β →* Perm (Sum α β) where
  toFun a := sumCongr a.1 a.2
  map_one' := sumCongr_one
  map_mul' _ _ := (sumCongr_mul _ _ _ _).symm
#align equiv.perm.sum_congr_hom Equiv.Perm.sumCongrHom
#align equiv.perm.sum_congr_hom_apply Equiv.Perm.sumCongrHom_apply

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant4a2de422583a83953f7755f6e84ea6dd57eca89abe46de7dd43e720a39919906.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant4a2de422583a83953f7755f6e84ea6dd57eca89abe46de7dd43e720a39919906.lean#L211).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `75036ac1aa74fd080e18f4b897b1c782d632b9b0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
