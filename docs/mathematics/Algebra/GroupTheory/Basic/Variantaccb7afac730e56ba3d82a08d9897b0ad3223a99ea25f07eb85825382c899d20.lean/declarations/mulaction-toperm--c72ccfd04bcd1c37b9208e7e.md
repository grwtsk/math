## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:624acf31f325ac195f16988c2dd4cafccdf63cd10f3da7560ecdc1ac884b3d43`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–45.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def MulAction.toPerm (a : α) : Equiv.Perm β :=
  ⟨fun x => a • x, fun x => a⁻¹ • x, inv_smul_smul a, smul_inv_smul a⟩

/-- Given an action of an additive group `α` on `β`, each `g : α` defines a permutation of `β`. -/
add_decl_doc AddAction.toPerm

/-- `MulAction.toPerm` is injective on faithful actions. -/
@[to_additive "`AddAction.toPerm` is injective on faithful actions."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantaccb7afac730e56ba3d82a08d9897b0ad3223a99ea25f07eb85825382c899d20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantaccb7afac730e56ba3d82a08d9897b0ad3223a99ea25f07eb85825382c899d20.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c8202afaf07ed281bc5fdc5ab7546062ffb45eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
