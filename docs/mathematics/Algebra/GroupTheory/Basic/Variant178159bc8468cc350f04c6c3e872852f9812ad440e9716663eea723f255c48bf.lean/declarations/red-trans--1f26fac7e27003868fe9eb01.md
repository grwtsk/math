## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:65c81ced-f4db-1114-7247-5cbcb1c68bc9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

namespace Red

/-- Predicate asserting that the word `w₁` can be reduced to `w₂` in one step, i.e. there are words
`w₃ w₄` and letter `x` such that `w₁ = w₃xx⁻¹w₄` and `w₂ = w₃w₄` -/
@[to_additive "Predicate asserting that the word `w₁` can be reduced to `w₂` in one step, i.e. there
  are words `w₃ w₄` and letter `x` such that `w₁ = w₃ + x + (-x) + w₄` and `w₂ = w₃w₄`"]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant178159bc8468cc350f04c6c3e872852f9812ad440e9716663eea723f255c48bf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant178159bc8468cc350f04c6c3e872852f9812ad440e9716663eea723f255c48bf.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cbfcfb52e251c4e1efad45501fe0bd45c4e8d0df` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
