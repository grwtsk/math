## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fea7136c46a79a59444f2d75a431635ffb45c0fa003c5398906ba9c0f5153104`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 467–476.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mkFract : (Ico (0 : R) 1 → G) ≃ (R →+c[1, a] G) where
  toFun f := ⟨fun x ↦ f ⟨Int.fract x, Int.fract_nonneg _, Int.fract_lt_one _⟩ + ⌊x⌋ • a, fun x ↦ by
    simp [add_one_zsmul, add_assoc]⟩
  invFun f x := f x
  left_inv _ := by ext x; simp [Int.fract_eq_self.2 x.2, Int.floor_eq_zero_iff.2 x.2]
  right_inv f := by ext x; simp [map_fract]

end FloorRing

end AddConstMap
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant232018613f2b1d13638fc4e9b783c9dafc461d27cb7189e2b1361cc5bc8b6e05.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant232018613f2b1d13638fc4e9b783c9dafc461d27cb7189e2b1361cc5bc8b6e05.lean#L467).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0b6f158def9999cfd7332419005455adced36735` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
