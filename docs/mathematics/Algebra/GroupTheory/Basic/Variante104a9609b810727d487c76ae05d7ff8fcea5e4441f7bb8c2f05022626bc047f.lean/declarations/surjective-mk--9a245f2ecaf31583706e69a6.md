## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1b216d19-a891-2178-3586-3dab4e8c4d4b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 115–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem surjective_mk {rels : FreeMonoid α → FreeMonoid α → Prop} :
    Function.Surjective (mk rels) := fun x ↦ PresentedMonoid.inductionOn x fun a ↦ .intro a rfl

section ToMonoid
variable {α M : Type*} [Monoid M] (f : α → M)
variable {rels : FreeMonoid α → FreeMonoid α → Prop}
variable (h : ∀ a b : FreeMonoid α, rels a b → FreeMonoid.lift f a = FreeMonoid.lift f b)

/-- The extension of a map `f : α → M` that satisfies the given relations to a monoid homomorphism
from `PresentedMonoid rels → M`. -/
@[to_additive "The extension of a map `f : α → M` that satisfies the given relations to an
additive-monoid homomorphism from `PresentedAddMonoid rels → M`"]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variante104a9609b810727d487c76ae05d7ff8fcea5e4441f7bb8c2f05022626bc047f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variante104a9609b810727d487c76ae05d7ff8fcea5e4441f7bb8c2f05022626bc047f.lean#L115).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8aac935b9e8a3f7a4c3c7d7a81ca6d728888aa46` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
