## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:018b3049a38a8d539a6516b12b51a3cc5ebfff4c96e989d5d68b9b5d52d22945`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 573–580.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected abbrev starAddMonoid [Star R] [AddMonoid R] [AddMonoid S] [StarAddMonoid S]
    (hf : Injective f) (star : ∀ x, f (star x) = star (f x)) (add : ∀ x y, f (x + y) = f x + f y) :
    StarAddMonoid R where
  toInvolutiveStar := hf.involutiveStar f star
  star_add x y := hf <| by rw [star, add, star_add, add, star, star]

/-- A non-unital non-associative ring endowed with `star` is a star ring if it admits an injective
map that preserves `star`, `*` and `+` to a star ring. See note [reducible non-instances]. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant3103ba9d246323bb0fd3670604c221c3c5c367cd60d0970a6b122cce0d7eaee6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant3103ba9d246323bb0fd3670604c221c3c5c367cd60d0970a6b122cce0d7eaee6.lean#L573).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bed47465b009816e4394655fddb3319e4c22bd76` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
