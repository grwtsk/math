## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:57d64a3d52cd6d21099c8005993724eec4f0b70586b874f39822105b3882f35d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance zpowers_isMulCommutative (g : G) : IsMulCommutative (zpowers g) :=
  ⟨⟨fun ⟨_, _, h₁⟩ ⟨_, _, h₂⟩ => by
      rw [Subtype.ext_iff, coe_mul, coe_mul, Subtype.coe_mk, Subtype.coe_mk, ← h₁, ← h₂,
        zpow_mul_comm]⟩⟩

@[deprecated (since := "2025-04-09")] alias zpowers_isCommutative := zpowers_isMulCommutative
@[deprecated (since := "2025-04-09")] alias _root_.AddSubgroup.zmultiples_isCommutative :=
  AddSubgroup.zmultiples_isAddCommutative

@[to_additive (attr := simp)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant4e9cf9ae1d7706667159dea0ba8cb1e08e4169a3d416509d0fe4979da5ccecc8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant4e9cf9ae1d7706667159dea0ba8cb1e08e4169a3d416509d0fe4979da5ccecc8.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `84f74b665a3ff6998894946ecff8d8dbc6638c85` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
