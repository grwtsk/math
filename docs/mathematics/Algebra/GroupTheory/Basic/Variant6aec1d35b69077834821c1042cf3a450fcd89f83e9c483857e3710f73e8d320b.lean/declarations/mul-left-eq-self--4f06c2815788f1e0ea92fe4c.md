## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ecc87fb1-312d-5183-7a71-e595de81931c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 216–222.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_left_eq_self : a * b = b ↔ a = 1 := calc
  a * b = b ↔ a * b = 1 * b := by rw [one_mul]
  _ ↔ a = 1 := mul_right_cancel_iff
#align mul_left_eq_self mul_left_eq_self
#align add_left_eq_self add_left_eq_self

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant6aec1d35b69077834821c1042cf3a450fcd89f83e9c483857e3710f73e8d320b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant6aec1d35b69077834821c1042cf3a450fcd89f83e9c483857e3710f73e8d320b.lean#L216).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c84fc623276b0799fb14c49f15281bddacae8efe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
