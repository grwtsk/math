## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:62b911e8-9a4a-e083-390d-b512d76ff359`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 930–936.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_eq_of_eq_div' (h : b = c / a) : a * b = c := by
  simp [h]
  rw [mul_comm c, mul_inv_cancel_left]
#align mul_eq_of_eq_div' mul_eq_of_eq_div'
#align add_eq_of_eq_sub' add_eq_of_eq_sub'

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant6aec1d35b69077834821c1042cf3a450fcd89f83e9c483857e3710f73e8d320b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant6aec1d35b69077834821c1042cf3a450fcd89f83e9c483857e3710f73e8d320b.lean#L930).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c84fc623276b0799fb14c49f15281bddacae8efe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
