## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3a6b76a70aa189e91a6353d45cf04292e720b512a8850f322f453959f592ee82`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 356–373.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {R M : Type*} [CommMonoid M] [SMul R M] [IsScalarTower R M M] : SMulCommClass R M M where
  smul_comm r s x := by
    rw [← one_smul M (s • x), ← smul_assoc, smul_comm, smul_assoc, one_smul]

-- Note: Previously there was a `MulDistribMulAction R (Localization S)`.
-- It was removed as it is not the correct action.

end Scalar

end Localization

variable {S N}

namespace MonoidHom

/-- Makes a localization map from a `CommMonoid` hom satisfying the characteristic predicate. -/
@[to_additive
    "Makes a localization map from an `AddCommMonoid` hom satisfying the characteristic predicate."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantff34d48a26daf5afbb41a63d4c9d105bfa38cdd636611e0cffad98779380778c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantff34d48a26daf5afbb41a63d4c9d105bfa38cdd636611e0cffad98779380778c.lean#L356).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b6ad4d45fb75bf6e2fb813747fdaf3b4f3d74e39` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
