## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5d879d2fab6f42fb3961e32a9f611c49352bf5cc6535beecbdef8338e215657e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 905–925.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : LawfulMonad FreeGroup.{u} := LawfulMonad.mk'
  (id_map := fun x =>
    FreeGroup.induction_on x (map_one id) (fun x => map_pure id x) (fun x ih => by rw [map_inv, ih])
      fun x y ihx ihy => by rw [map_mul, ihx, ihy])
  (pure_bind := fun x f => pure_bind f x)
  (bind_assoc := fun x =>
    FreeGroup.induction_on x
      (by intros; iterate 3 rw [one_bind])
      (fun x => by intros; iterate 2 rw [pure_bind])
      (fun x ih => by intros; (iterate 3 rw [inv_bind]); rw [ih])
      (fun x y ihx ihy => by intros; (iterate 3 rw [mul_bind]); rw [ihx, ihy]))
  (bind_pure_comp := fun f x =>
    FreeGroup.induction_on x
      (by rw [one_bind, map_one])
      (fun x => by rw [pure_bind, map_pure])
      (fun x ih => by rw [inv_bind, map_inv, ih])
      (fun x y ihx ihy => by rw [mul_bind, map_mul, ihx, ihy]))

end Category

end FreeGroup
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant52560a43009f09219c125caaa8bf2c1a5f9795557131dbd809bc6e8405497391.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant52560a43009f09219c125caaa8bf2c1a5f9795557131dbd809bc6e8405497391.lean#L905).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `af769677f07851e84182859693fd0ac5ed86c1dd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
