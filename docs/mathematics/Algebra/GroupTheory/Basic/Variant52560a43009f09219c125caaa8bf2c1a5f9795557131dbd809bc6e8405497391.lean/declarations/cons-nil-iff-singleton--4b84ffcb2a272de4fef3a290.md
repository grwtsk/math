## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:699e9e58-73fe-187b-29e5-de1ded69d41f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 274–285.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cons_nil_iff_singleton {x b} : Red ((x, b) :: L) [] ↔ Red L [(x, not b)] :=
  Iff.intro
    (fun h => by
      have h₁ : Red ((x, not b) :: (x, b) :: L) [(x, not b)] := cons_cons h
      have h₂ : Red ((x, not b) :: (x, b) :: L) L := ReflTransGen.single Step.cons_not_rev
      let ⟨L', h₁, h₂⟩ := church_rosser h₁ h₂
      rw [singleton_iff] at h₁
      subst L'
      assumption)
    fun h => (cons_cons h).tail Step.cons_not

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant52560a43009f09219c125caaa8bf2c1a5f9795557131dbd809bc6e8405497391.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant52560a43009f09219c125caaa8bf2c1a5f9795557131dbd809bc6e8405497391.lean#L274).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `af769677f07851e84182859693fd0ac5ed86c1dd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
