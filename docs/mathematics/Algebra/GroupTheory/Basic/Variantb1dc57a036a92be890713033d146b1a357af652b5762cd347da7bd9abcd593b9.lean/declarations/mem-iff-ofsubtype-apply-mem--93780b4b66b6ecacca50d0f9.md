## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c67bc922-b6ba-9afb-f1af-bb77d70780f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 471–478.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_iff_ofSubtype_apply_mem (f : Perm (Subtype p)) (x : α) :
    p x ↔ p ((ofSubtype f : α → α) x) :=
  if h : p x then by
    simpa only [h, true_iff_iff, MonoidHom.coe_mk, ofSubtype_apply_of_mem f h] using (f ⟨x, h⟩).2
  else by simp [h, ofSubtype_apply_of_not_mem f h]
#align equiv.perm.mem_iff_of_subtype_apply_mem Equiv.Perm.mem_iff_ofSubtype_apply_mem

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantb1dc57a036a92be890713033d146b1a357af652b5762cd347da7bd9abcd593b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantb1dc57a036a92be890713033d146b1a357af652b5762cd347da7bd9abcd593b9.lean#L471).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9089d75f89716e574c300bf8d9d6ae80c3d7901e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
