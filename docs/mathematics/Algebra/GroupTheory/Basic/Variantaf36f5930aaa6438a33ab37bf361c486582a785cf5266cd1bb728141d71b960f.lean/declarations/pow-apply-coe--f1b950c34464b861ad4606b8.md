## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cfa3fa00-38db-054d-468a-c3047584e138`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 357–362.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pow_apply_coe (χ : MulChar R R') (n : ℕ) (a : Rˣ) : (χ ^ n) a = χ a ^ n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rw [pow_zero, pow_zero, one_apply_coe]
  | succ n ih => rw [pow_succ, pow_succ, mul_apply, ih]

/-- If `n` is positive, then `(χ ^ n) a = (χ a) ^ n`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantaf36f5930aaa6438a33ab37bf361c486582a785cf5266cd1bb728141d71b960f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantaf36f5930aaa6438a33ab37bf361c486582a785cf5266cd1bb728141d71b960f.lean#L357).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1a4f9d43e29eae9bcb559cf515bfcbc90efdae91` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
