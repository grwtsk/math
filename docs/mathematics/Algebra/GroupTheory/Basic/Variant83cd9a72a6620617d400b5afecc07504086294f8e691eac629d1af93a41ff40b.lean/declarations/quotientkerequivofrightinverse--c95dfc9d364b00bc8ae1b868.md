## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1fdabbb5eaac456de3cdefdbb9c33d99ab7fe93f6466a57a5efa85feee863067`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 149–157.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def quotientKerEquivOfRightInverse (ψ : H → G) (hφ : RightInverse ψ φ) : G ⧸ ker φ ≃* H :=
  { kerLift φ with
    toFun := kerLift φ
    invFun := mk ∘ ψ
    left_inv := fun x => kerLift_injective φ (by rw [Function.comp_apply, kerLift_mk, hφ])
    right_inv := hφ }

/-- The canonical isomorphism `G/⊥ ≃* G`. -/
@[to_additive (attr := simps!) /-- The canonical isomorphism `G/⊥ ≃+ G`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant83cd9a72a6620617d400b5afecc07504086294f8e691eac629d1af93a41ff40b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant83cd9a72a6620617d400b5afecc07504086294f8e691eac629d1af93a41ff40b.lean#L149).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a93a59bba6b604056d5152bef719eabaa3503d5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
