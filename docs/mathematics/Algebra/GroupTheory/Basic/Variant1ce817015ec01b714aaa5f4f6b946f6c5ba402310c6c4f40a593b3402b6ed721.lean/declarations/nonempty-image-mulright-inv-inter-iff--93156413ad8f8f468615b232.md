## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:efcc8d2a-78af-14ad-a15c-8f17acafcfec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 796–802.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[to_additive] theorem nonempty_image_mulRight_inv_inter_iff {a : α} :
    ((· * a⁻¹) '' s ∩ t).Nonempty ↔ ((a * ·) '' s⁻¹ ∩ t⁻¹).Nonempty := by
  rw [← nonempty_inv, inter_inv]; simp_rw [← image_inv_eq_inv, image_image, mul_inv_rev, inv_inv]

/-- `Set α` is a division monoid under pointwise operations if `α` is. -/
@[to_additive (attr := instance_reducible)
    /-- `Set α` is a subtraction monoid under pointwise operations if `α` is. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant1ce817015ec01b714aaa5f4f6b946f6c5ba402310c6c4f40a593b3402b6ed721.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variant1ce817015ec01b714aaa5f4f6b946f6c5ba402310c6c4f40a593b3402b6ed721.lean#L796).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ce9ccce091e01e2819ccccbab70935c2518bdca8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
