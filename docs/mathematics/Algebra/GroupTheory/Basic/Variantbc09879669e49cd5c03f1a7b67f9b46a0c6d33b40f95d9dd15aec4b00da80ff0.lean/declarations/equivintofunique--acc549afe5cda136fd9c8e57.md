## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f69b96b12e3575263887c70a1614ffe8e11fdf7137977dc770ee6a664f8c5eac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 959–974.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def equivIntOfUnique [Unique α] : FreeGroup α ≃ ℤ where
  toFun x := sum (map 1 x)
  invFun x := of default ^ x
  left_inv x := by
    induction x with
    | one => simp
    | of x => simp [Unique.default_eq x]
    | inv_of x hx => simp [Unique.default_eq x]
    | mul x y hx hy => simp [zpow_add, hx, hy]
  right_inv x := by
    induction x with
    | zero => simp
    | succ x hx => simpa [zpow_add_one] using hx
    | pred x hx => simpa [zpow_sub_one, ← sub_eq_add_neg] using hx

/-- The isomorphism between the free group on a unique type and the integers. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantbc09879669e49cd5c03f1a7b67f9b46a0c6d33b40f95d9dd15aec4b00da80ff0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantbc09879669e49cd5c03f1a7b67f9b46a0c6d33b40f95d9dd15aec4b00da80ff0.lean#L959).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb7975ce0da642f83a73d935238750d988813eef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
