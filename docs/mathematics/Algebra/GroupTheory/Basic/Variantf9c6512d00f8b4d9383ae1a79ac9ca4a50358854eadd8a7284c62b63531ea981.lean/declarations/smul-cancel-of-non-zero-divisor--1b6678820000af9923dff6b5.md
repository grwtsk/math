## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ed2b85ed-f6b3-36b3-37fb-b5e6c951c166`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–122.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem smul_cancel_of_non_zero_divisor {M G : Type*} [Monoid M] [AddGroup G]
    [DistribMulAction M G] (k : M) (h : ∀ x : G, k • x = 0 → x = 0) {a b : G} (h' : k • a = k • b) :
    a = b := by
  rw [← sub_eq_zero]
  refine h _ ?_
  rw [smul_sub, h', sub_self]

namespace MulAction
variable {G α β : Type*} [Group G] [MulAction G α] [MulAction G β]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantf9c6512d00f8b4d9383ae1a79ac9ca4a50358854eadd8a7284c62b63531ea981.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Basic/Variantf9c6512d00f8b4d9383ae1a79ac9ca4a50358854eadd8a7284c62b63531ea981.lean#L113).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `45a245cf5a9ca61c1961b7d9febaa959ca0aa21f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
