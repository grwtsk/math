## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f98664b2-2595-f8b4-af76-c23546b5e683`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1323–1329.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem MonotoneOn.mul_const' [CovariantClass α α (swap (· * ·)) (· ≤ ·)] (hf : MonotoneOn f s)
    (a : α) :
    MonotoneOn (fun x => f x * a) s := fun _ hx _ hy h => mul_le_mul_right' (hf hx hy h) a
#align monotone_on.mul_const' MonotoneOn.mul_const'
#align monotone_on.add_const MonotoneOn.add_const

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Lemmas/Variant288258f6a4f8de825532677524c349a725a8d4888bb35adbb0b1c32fb6861190.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Lemmas/Variant288258f6a4f8de825532677524c349a725a8d4888bb35adbb0b1c32fb6861190.lean#L1323).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93c5dbcb8e9006c93f13e932c2ae88af47ef9f27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
