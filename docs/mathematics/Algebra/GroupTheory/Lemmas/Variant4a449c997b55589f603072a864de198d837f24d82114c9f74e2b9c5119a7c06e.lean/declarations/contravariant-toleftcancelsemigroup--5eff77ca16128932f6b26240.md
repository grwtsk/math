## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:21dc13693182b414e56019b1e6f51948822d64f0a1af9aa6db7a225f4d3c5ab1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1219–1231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Contravariant.toLeftCancelSemigroup [ContravariantClass α α (· * ·) (· ≤ ·)] :
    LeftCancelSemigroup α :=
  { ‹Semigroup α› with mul_left_cancel := fun a b c => mul_left_cancel'' }
#align contravariant.to_left_cancel_semigroup Contravariant.toLeftCancelSemigroup
#align contravariant.to_left_cancel_add_semigroup Contravariant.toAddLeftCancelSemigroup

/- This is not instance, since we want to have an instance from `RightCancelSemigroup`s
to the appropriate `CovariantClass`. -/
/-- A semigroup with a partial order and satisfying `RightCancelSemigroup`
(i.e. `a * c < b * c → a < b`) is a `right_cancel Semigroup`. -/
@[to_additive
"An additive semigroup with a partial order and satisfying `AddRightCancelSemigroup`
(`a + c < b + c → a < b`) is a `right_cancel AddSemigroup`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Lemmas/Variant4a449c997b55589f603072a864de198d837f24d82114c9f74e2b9c5119a7c06e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Lemmas/Variant4a449c997b55589f603072a864de198d837f24d82114c9f74e2b9c5119a7c06e.lean#L1219).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9584337874155f8b0b3d61930a857873f57f9622` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
