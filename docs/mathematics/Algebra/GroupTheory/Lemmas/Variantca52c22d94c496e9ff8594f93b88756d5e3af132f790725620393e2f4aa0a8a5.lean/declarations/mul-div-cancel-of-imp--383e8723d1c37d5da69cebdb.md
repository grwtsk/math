## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ed1d08d8-d6f4-0701-fb2c-a88799d6b626`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 176–179.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_div_cancel_of_imp' {a b : G₀} (h : b = 0 → a = 0) : b * (a / b) = a := by
  rw [mul_comm, div_mul_cancel_of_imp h]
#align mul_div_cancel_of_imp' mul_div_cancel_of_imp'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Lemmas/Variantca52c22d94c496e9ff8594f93b88756d5e3af132f790725620393e2f4aa0a8a5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Lemmas/Variantca52c22d94c496e9ff8594f93b88756d5e3af132f790725620393e2f4aa0a8a5.lean#L176).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e83fdf511c3b2bd8daadc2d3dabba984e43a0973` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
