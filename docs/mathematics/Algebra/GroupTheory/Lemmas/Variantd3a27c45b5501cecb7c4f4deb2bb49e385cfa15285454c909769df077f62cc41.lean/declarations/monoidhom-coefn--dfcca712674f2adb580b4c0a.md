## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5640aef94cfb66d3c770c999db85b36b4e74fd5d65a5d8c22a87b887706e76f8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 229–238.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def MonoidHom.coeFn (α β : Type*) [MulOneClass α] [CommMonoid β] : (α →* β) →* α → β where
  toFun g := g
  map_one' := rfl
  map_mul' _ _ := rfl

/-- Monoid homomorphism between the function spaces `I → α` and `I → β`, induced by a monoid
homomorphism `f` between `α` and `β`. -/
@[to_additive (attr := simps)
  /-- Additive monoid homomorphism between the function spaces `I → α` and `I → β`, induced by an
  additive monoid homomorphism `f` between `α` and `β` -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Lemmas/Variantd3a27c45b5501cecb7c4f4deb2bb49e385cfa15285454c909769df077f62cc41.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Lemmas/Variantd3a27c45b5501cecb7c4f4deb2bb49e385cfa15285454c909769df077f62cc41.lean#L229).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `89c6fff9d700c8bf472eb97f897eaaf5d8a0e062` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
