## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d7231bda-5656-5c6d-eb0d-6628f243c1f9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 597–601.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem zsmul_eq_mul [Ring R] (a : R) : ∀ n : ℤ, n • a = n * a
  | (n : ℕ) => by rw [coe_nat_zsmul, nsmul_eq_mul, Int.cast_ofNat]
  | -[n+1] => by simp [Nat.cast_succ, neg_add_rev, Int.cast_negSucc, add_mul]
#align zsmul_eq_mul zsmul_eq_mul

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Lemmas/Variante7ca6e56d72f285c3e11b68227f7245a1d8b8eaf7844a5fc1b4c128a9b394454.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Lemmas/Variante7ca6e56d72f285c3e11b68227f7245a1d8b8eaf7844a5fc1b4c128a9b394454.lean#L597).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93e48c115a1b5b62b7930981447cbd1f44e2729c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
