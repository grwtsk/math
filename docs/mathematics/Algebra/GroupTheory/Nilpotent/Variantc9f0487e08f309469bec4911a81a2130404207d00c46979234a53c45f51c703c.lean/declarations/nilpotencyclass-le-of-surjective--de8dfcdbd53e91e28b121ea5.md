## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0facd8d1-1e06-04a0-ac68-59969c4e71fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 546–558.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nilpotencyClass_le_of_surjective {G' : Type*} [Group G'] (f : G →* G')
    (hf : Function.Surjective f) [h : IsNilpotent G] :
    Group.nilpotencyClass (hG := nilpotent_of_surjective _ hf) ≤ Group.nilpotencyClass G := by
  classical apply Nat.find_mono
  intro n hn
  rw [eq_top_iff]
  calc
    ⊤ = f.range := symm (f.range_eq_top_of_surjective hf)
    _ = Subgroup.map f ⊤ := MonoidHom.range_eq_map _
    _ = Subgroup.map f (upperCentralSeries G n) := by rw [hn]
    _ ≤ upperCentralSeries G' n := upperCentralSeries.map hf n

/-- Nilpotency respects isomorphisms -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Nilpotent/Variantc9f0487e08f309469bec4911a81a2130404207d00c46979234a53c45f51c703c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Nilpotent/Variantc9f0487e08f309469bec4911a81a2130404207d00c46979234a53c45f51c703c.lean#L546).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7daadc8d4a5272557076fb6cb1d6dcf712139a6d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
