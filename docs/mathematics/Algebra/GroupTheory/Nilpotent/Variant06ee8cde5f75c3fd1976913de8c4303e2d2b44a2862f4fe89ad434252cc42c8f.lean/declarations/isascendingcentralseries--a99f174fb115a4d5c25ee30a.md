## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:671154e10700a3de8fad338ca5a8e230f79853bab1d07eea0778337d06e091cc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–187.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IsAscendingCentralSeries (H : ℕ → Subgroup G) : Prop :=
  H 0 = ⊥ ∧ ∀ (x : G) (n : ℕ), x ∈ H (n + 1) → ∀ g, x * g * x⁻¹ * g⁻¹ ∈ H n
#align is_ascending_central_series IsAscendingCentralSeries

/-- A sequence of subgroups of `G` is a descending central series if `H 0` is `G` and
  `⁅H n, G⁆ ⊆ H (n + 1)` for all `n`. Note that we do not require that `H n = {1}` for some `n`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Nilpotent/Variant06ee8cde5f75c3fd1976913de8c4303e2d2b44a2862f4fe89ad434252cc42c8f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Nilpotent/Variant06ee8cde5f75c3fd1976913de8c4303e2d2b44a2862f4fe89ad434252cc42c8f.lean#L182).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1408797175d66cebe86309621d6063bfdcba86d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
