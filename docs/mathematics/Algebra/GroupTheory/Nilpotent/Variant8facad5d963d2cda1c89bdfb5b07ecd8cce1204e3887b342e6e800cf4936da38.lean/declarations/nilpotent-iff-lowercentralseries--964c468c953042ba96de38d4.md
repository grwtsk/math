## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:44f21de2-662c-6fa5-dc54-f408d3cd3b35`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 514–529.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem nilpotent_iff_lowerCentralSeries :
    IsNilpotent G ↔ ∃ n, lowerCentralSeries (⊤ : Subgroup G) n = ⊥ :=
  Group.isNilpotent_top.symm.trans (isNilpotent_iff_lowerCentralSeries ⊤)

end Subgroup

section Classical

variable (G) in
open scoped Classical in
/-- The nilpotency class of a nilpotent group is the smallest natural `n` such that
the `n`-th term of the upper central series is `G`. If `G` is not nilpotent then the nilpotency
class takes the junk value 0. -/
@[to_additive /-- The nilpotency class of a nilpotent additive group is the smallest natural `n`
such that the `n`-th term of the upper central series is `G`. If `G` is not nilpotent then the
nilpotency class takes the junk value 0. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Nilpotent/Variant8facad5d963d2cda1c89bdfb5b07ecd8cce1204e3887b342e6e800cf4936da38.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Nilpotent/Variant8facad5d963d2cda1c89bdfb5b07ecd8cce1204e3887b342e6e800cf4936da38.lean#L514).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5fa00367eb3bad43d0c638d420316f801679775a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
