## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0a3e4962-3d38-a6b5-7c88-317700ffa446`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 922–938.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nilpotent_center_quotient_ind {P : ∀ (G) [Group G] [IsNilpotent G], Prop}
    (G : Type*) [Group G] [IsNilpotent G]
    (hbase : ∀ (G) [Group G] [Subsingleton G], P G)
    (hstep : ∀ (G) [Group G] [IsNilpotent G], P (G ⧸ center G) → P G) : P G := by
  obtain ⟨n, h⟩ : ∃ n, Group.nilpotencyClass G = n := ⟨_, rfl⟩
  induction n generalizing G with
  | zero =>
    have := nilpotencyClass_zero_iff_subsingleton.mp h
    exact hbase _
  | succ n ih =>
    have hn : Group.nilpotencyClass (G ⧸ center G) = n := by
      simp [nilpotencyClass_quotient_center, h]
    exact hstep _ (ih _ hn)

end Group

-- todo: namespace `derivedSeries` and to_additivize.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Nilpotent/Variant63511213e5886a297f6bdf5b650cd2b5f3f63d4f244684a71c31455f21f3f4e5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Nilpotent/Variant63511213e5886a297f6bdf5b650cd2b5f3f63d4f244684a71c31455f21f3f4e5.lean#L922).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `30c59694ffb89b9851d8498640ef653bd9c59778` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
