## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c35ed1b922dfa7f4d4c7aa2cb4147a343acb62d523933f2d4c3d6d82007a5f3d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 344–356.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def evalₐ (R : Type*) [CommSemiring R] [Semiring Y] [Algebra R Y] (x : X) :
    LocallyConstant X Y →ₐ[R] Y :=
  (Pi.evalAlgHom _ _ x).comp (coeFnAlgHom R)

end Eval

section Comap

variable [TopologicalSpace Y]

/-- `LocallyConstant.comap` as a `MulHom`. -/
@[to_additive (attr := simps) "`LocallyConstant.comap` as an `AddHom`."]
noncomputable
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Algebra/Variantf986d1f530fc0b3ecf7032d817582a39d8ce27de94033cd48eca1e9de47bd59b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Algebra/Variantf986d1f530fc0b3ecf7032d817582a39d8ce27de94033cd48eca1e9de47bd59b.lean#L344).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c86fa2c9e8239dd99ddb9d25368c5e573aa70b4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
