## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a05ec22f1a3e00be303971f3bef2564b4a3e92a0e93759267e5c3ef7352cb6cd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 202–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instDivInvMonoid [DivInvMonoid α] : DivInvMonoid (WithZero α) where
  div_eq_mul_inv
    | none, _ => rfl
    | some _, none => rfl
    | some a, some b => congr_arg some (div_eq_mul_inv a b)
  zpow n a := a ^ n
  zpow_zero'
    | none => rfl
    | some _ => congr_arg some (zpow_zero _)
  zpow_succ'
    | n, none => by change 0 ^ _ = 0 ^ _ * 0; simp only [mul_zero]; rfl
    | n, some _ => congr_arg some (DivInvMonoid.zpow_succ' _ _)
  zpow_neg'
    | n, none => rfl
    | n, some _ => congr_arg some (DivInvMonoid.zpow_neg' _ _)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/WithZero/Variantba4d4e992ac3cf1e1812b94c83df1ba3856a3ecf3bf921fb4bd80dd9c39c1f20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/WithZero/Variantba4d4e992ac3cf1e1812b94c83df1ba3856a3ecf3bf921fb4bd80dd9c39c1f20.lean#L202).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `868a2d52c68dd3491abf1414b84702efca0ff30a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
