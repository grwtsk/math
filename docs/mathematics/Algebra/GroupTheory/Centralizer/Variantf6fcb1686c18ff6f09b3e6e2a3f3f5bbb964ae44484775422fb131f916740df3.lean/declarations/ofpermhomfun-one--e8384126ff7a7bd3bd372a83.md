## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3c4a1551-ea34-4793-91e0-4b3f9c2010ec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 352–359.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ofPermHomFun_one (x : α) : (ofPermHomFun a 1) x = x := by
  rcases mem_fixedPoints_or_exists_zpow_eq a x with (hx | ⟨c, hc, m, hm⟩)
  · rw [ofPermHomFun_apply_of_mem_fixedPoints a _ hx]
  · rw [ofPermHomFun_apply_of_cycleOf_mem a _ hc hm, OneMemClass.coe_one, coe_one, id_eq, hm]

/-- Given `a : g.Basis` and a permutation of `g.cycleFactorsFinset` that
  preserve the lengths of the cycles, a permutation of `α` that
  moves the `Basis` and commutes with `g` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Centralizer/Variantf6fcb1686c18ff6f09b3e6e2a3f3f5bbb964ae44484775422fb131f916740df3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Centralizer/Variantf6fcb1686c18ff6f09b3e6e2a3f3f5bbb964ae44484775422fb131f916740df3.lean#L352).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d69eedbbaa6aea3acbc9778d6e1be02643b802a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
