## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:52e5dd8168f27e4a972bfe6e0f7724b5abf83c855a37b5f236abee20346e3270`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 95–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev closureCommMonoidOfComm {s : Set M} (hcomm : ∀ a ∈ s, ∀ b ∈ s, a * b = b * a) :
    CommMonoid (closure s) :=
  { (closure s).toMonoid with
    mul_comm := fun ⟨_, h₁⟩ ⟨_, h₂⟩ ↦
      have := closure_le_centralizer_centralizer s
      Subtype.ext <| Set.centralizer_centralizer_comm_of_comm hcomm _ (this h₁) _ (this h₂) }

end

end Submonoid
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Centralizer/Variant0b72b1bb9ba7cd01714f441bd7a36936bc2a140a0ae4a8040a4660352a021715.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Centralizer/Variant0b72b1bb9ba7cd01714f441bd7a36936bc2a140a0ae4a8040a4660352a021715.lean#L95).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `678208079f4bf9ecdabc4294a6e8a2a042a55898` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
