## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a21f81ea2a1602272c128a8f32a14c78a51d3bd1d3c1dd45a0a758f8582e5dea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 349–357.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def ofPermHom : range_toPermHom' g →* Perm α where
  toFun τ := {
    toFun := ofPermHomFun a τ
    invFun := ofPermHomFun a τ⁻¹
    left_inv := fun x ↦ by rw [← ofPermHomFun_mul, inv_mul_cancel, ofPermHomFun_one]
    right_inv := fun x ↦ by rw [← ofPermHomFun_mul, mul_inv_cancel, ofPermHomFun_one] }
  map_one' := ext fun x ↦ ofPermHomFun_one a x
  map_mul' := fun σ τ ↦ ext fun x ↦ by simp [mul_apply, ofPermHomFun_mul a σ τ x]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Centralizer/Variant7c93aa8a72a347e32026c75b73e1b517144b87f67d1bee0edf62800516a62d0d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Centralizer/Variant7c93aa8a72a347e32026c75b73e1b517144b87f67d1bee0edf62800516a62d0d.lean#L349).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0b31d5347353f78d4a7c8c5000b56cc15c29a8bb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
