## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:42fb904a-ccf6-2ace-6e36-3e7c8f1e299b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 409–422.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem decomposeSteps_recompose (h : ℕ+) (n : ℕ) :
    (decomposeSteps h n).laps * cycleLength h +
        (decomposeSteps h n).residual = n := by
  simpa [decomposeSteps, Nat.mul_comm] using
    (Nat.div_add_mod n (cycleLength h))

/--
`q` complete circuits act first as the `q`th power of based monodromy; the
remaining `n` edges then act from the same base phase.  The explicit `.trans`
orientation matters: for linear equivalences, `f.trans g` applies `f` and
then `g`, whereas the group multiplication convention satisfies
`f * g = g.trans f`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/CyclicHolonomy/Variant8c023ab2404a0837420e7192004609ebc44a28f770846e4e4420d3f73703ed44.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/CyclicHolonomy/Variant8c023ab2404a0837420e7192004609ebc44a28f770846e4e4420d3f73703ed44.lean#L409).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `68a18bf167ec625c0ba80015abe96b4d64f04b94` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
