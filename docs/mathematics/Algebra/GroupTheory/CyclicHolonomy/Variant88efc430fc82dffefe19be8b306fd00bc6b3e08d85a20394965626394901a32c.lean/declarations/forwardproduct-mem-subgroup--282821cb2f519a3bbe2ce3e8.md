## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:853eab80-c7d0-a3a7-16d3-fa80c6e1ddd7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–224.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem forwardProduct_mem_subgroup (system : StepSystem h)
    (G : Subgroup (Fiber3 ≃ₗ[ℝ] Fiber3))
    (hG : StepsInSubgroup system G) (p : CoverPhase h) (n : ℕ) :
    system.forwardProduct p n ∈ G := by
  induction n generalizing p with
  | zero =>
      exact G.one_mem
  | succ n ih =>
      rw [system.forwardProduct_succ, ← LinearEquiv.mul_eq_trans]
      exact G.mul_mem (ih (p := successor h p)) (hG p)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/CyclicHolonomy/Variant88efc430fc82dffefe19be8b306fd00bc6b3e08d85a20394965626394901a32c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/CyclicHolonomy/Variant88efc430fc82dffefe19be8b306fd00bc6b3e08d85a20394965626394901a32c.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5271aff56c2493cef936719e00a6bf53503b36c3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
