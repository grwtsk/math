## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:039c8466fbb142754e854a6b4161b1013ae65334f6826e784ad8d76f8b3e0f5a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–98.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class NonUnitalRingHomClass (F : Type*) (α β : outParam (Type*)) [NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring α]
  [NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring β] extends MulHomClass F α β, AddMonoidHomClass F α β
#align non_unital_ring_hom_class NonUnitalRingHomClass

variable [NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring α] [NonUnitalNonAssocSemiring β] [NonUnitalRingHomClass F α β]

/-- Turn an element of a type `F` satisfying `NonUnitalRingHomClass F α β` into an actual
`NonUnitalRingHom`. This is declared as the default coercion from `F` to `α →ₙ+* β`. -/
@[coe]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Ring/Variant9725dd08c871dc7d01bcaf731cfdfec88760b464ef410493c3da0dfce77da4e4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Ring/Variant9725dd08c871dc7d01bcaf731cfdfec88760b464ef410493c3da0dfce77da4e4.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80d9623f7ab39ce0ed7b4510866b80bfe977fb89` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
