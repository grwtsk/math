## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d247129c-db30-8435-07c0-10132f229756`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 241–250.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem fromUnitLift_injective [Fact <| 0 < n] :
    Function.Injective <| @fromUnitLift R _ _ K _ _ _ n _ := by
  dsimp only [fromUnitLift, MonoidHom.coe_comp, MulEquiv.coe_toMonoidHom]
  exact Function.Injective.comp (QuotientGroup.kerLift_injective _) (MulEquiv.injective _)

end selmerGroup

end

end IsDedekindDomain
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/SelmerGroup/Variant88bcff4b15ae99a6a4839ca8773a11f629124f371fd34eae91d91547ed8ada11.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/SelmerGroup/Variant88bcff4b15ae99a6a4839ca8773a11f629124f371fd34eae91d91547ed8ada11.lean#L241).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cec46ad74a3a463c4af4c940068dc1bcb50a86f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
