## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e129f55054e64eebf54d75efb15fcf46815197b486e2ccedcac365e72660bf78`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 92–121.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure MulActionHom where
  /-- The underlying function. -/
  protected toFun : X → Y
  /-- The proposition that the function commutes with the actions. -/
  protected map_smul' : ∀ (m : M) (x : X), toFun (m • x) = (φ m) • toFun x

/-- `φ`-equivariant functions `X → Y`,
where `φ : M → N`, where `M` and `N` act on `X` and `Y` respectively. -/
notation:25 (name := «MulActionHomLocal≺») X " →ₑ[" φ:25 "] " Y:0 => MulActionHom φ X Y

/-- `M`-equivariant functions `X → Y` with respect to the action of `M`.
This is the same as `X →ₑ[@id M] Y`. -/
notation:25 (name := «MulActionHomIdLocal≺») X " →[" M:25 "] " Y:0 => MulActionHom (@id M) X Y

/-- `φ`-equivariant functions `X → Y`,
where `φ : M → N`, where `M` and `N` act additively on `X` and `Y` respectively

We use the same notation as for multiplicative actions, as conflicts are unlikely. -/
notation:25 (name := «AddActionHomLocal≺») X " →ₑ[" φ:25 "] " Y:0 => AddActionHom φ X Y

/-- `M`-equivariant functions `X → Y` with respect to the additive action of `M`.
This is the same as `X →ₑ[@id M] Y`.

We use the same notation as for multiplicative actions, as conflicts are unlikely. -/
notation:25 (name := «AddActionHomIdLocal≺») X " →[" M:25 "] " Y:0 => AddActionHom (@id M) X Y

/-- `AddActionSemiHomClass F φ X Y` states that
  `F` is a type of morphisms which are `φ`-equivariant.

You should extend this class when you extend `AddActionHom`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Hom/Varianta7b90eff7b1a2a8078e4a318c6f0aa877bf1cbbb4dfa19f427f6f2f8b11ba48d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Hom/Varianta7b90eff7b1a2a8078e4a318c6f0aa877bf1cbbb4dfa19f427f6f2f8b11ba48d.lean#L92).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `85d6a80071c9a60726fbc6f38f37756eb6a8d136` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
