## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5cfd738840a88082387a3c70a82a8b6c5bb8747f4c6de17ca85dbc4b7dbdad84`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 659–675.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class MulDistribMulActionSemiHomClass (F : Type*)
    {M N : outParam Type*} (φ : outParam (M → N))
    (A B : outParam Type*)
    [Monoid M] [Monoid N]
    [Monoid A] [Monoid B] [MulDistribMulAction M A] [MulDistribMulAction N B]
    [FunLike F A B] : Prop
    extends MulActionSemiHomClass F φ A B, MonoidHomClass F A B

/-- `MulDistribMulActionHomClass F M A B` states that `F` is a type of morphisms preserving
the monoid structure and equivariant with respect to the action of `M`.
It is an abbreviation to `MulDistribMulActionHomClass F (MonoidHom.id M) A B`
You should extend this class when you extend `MulDistribMulActionHom`. -/
@[to_additive (dont_translate := M) DistribMulActionHomClass
/-- `DistribMulActionHomClass F M A B` states that `F` is a type of morphisms preserving
the additive monoid structure and equivariant with respect to the action of `M`.
It is an abbreviation to `DistribMulActionHomClass F (MonoidHom.id M) A B`
You should extend this class when you extend `DistribMulActionHom`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Hom/Varianta7b90eff7b1a2a8078e4a318c6f0aa877bf1cbbb4dfa19f427f6f2f8b11ba48d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Hom/Varianta7b90eff7b1a2a8078e4a318c6f0aa877bf1cbbb4dfa19f427f6f2f8b11ba48d.lean#L659).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `85d6a80071c9a60726fbc6f38f37756eb6a8d136` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
