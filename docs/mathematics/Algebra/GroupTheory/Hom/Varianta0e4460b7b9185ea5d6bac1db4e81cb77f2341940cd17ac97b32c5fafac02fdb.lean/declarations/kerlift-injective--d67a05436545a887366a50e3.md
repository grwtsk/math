## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5a3dc27b-a0c0-9f3b-a951-860d0b227c55`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 295–302.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem kerLift_injective (f : M →* P) : Injective (kerLift f) := fun x y =>
  Quotient.inductionOn₂' x y fun _ _ => (ker f).eq.2

/-- Given congruence relations `c, d` on a monoid such that `d` contains `c`, `d`'s quotient
    map induces a homomorphism from the quotient by `c` to the quotient by `d`. -/
@[to_additive "Given additive congruence relations `c, d` on an `AddMonoid` such that `d`
contains `c`, `d`'s quotient map induces a homomorphism from the quotient by `c` to the quotient
by `d`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Hom/Varianta0e4460b7b9185ea5d6bac1db4e81cb77f2341940cd17ac97b32c5fafac02fdb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Hom/Varianta0e4460b7b9185ea5d6bac1db4e81cb77f2341940cd17ac97b32c5fafac02fdb.lean#L295).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a9db0d480f3d03f00b5d8d97d0c115fd22f0949` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
