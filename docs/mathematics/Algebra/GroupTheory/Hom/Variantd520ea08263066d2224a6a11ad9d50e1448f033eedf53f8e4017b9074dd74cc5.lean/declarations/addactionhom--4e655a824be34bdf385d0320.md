## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:be18e7632ba738199979c5f75d8e67d15f710480ce654f50575aa996e74bd3fb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure AddActionHom {M N : Type*} (φ: M → N) (X : Type*) [VAdd M X] (Y : Type*) [VAdd N Y] where
  /-- The underlying function. -/
  protected toFun : X → Y
  /-- The proposition that the function commutes with the additive actions. -/
  protected map_vadd' : ∀ (m : M) (x : X), toFun (m +ᵥ x) = (φ m) +ᵥ toFun x

/-- Equivariant functions :
When `φ : M → N` is a function, and types `X` and `Y` are endowed with actions of `M` and `N`,
a function `f : X → Y` is `φ`-equivariant if `f (m • x) = (φ m) • (f x)`. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Hom/Variantd520ea08263066d2224a6a11ad9d50e1448f033eedf53f8e4017b9074dd74cc5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Hom/Variantd520ea08263066d2224a6a11ad9d50e1448f033eedf53f8e4017b9074dd74cc5.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e917791cd9952f7a22b9db6c34814674e7b08ac1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
