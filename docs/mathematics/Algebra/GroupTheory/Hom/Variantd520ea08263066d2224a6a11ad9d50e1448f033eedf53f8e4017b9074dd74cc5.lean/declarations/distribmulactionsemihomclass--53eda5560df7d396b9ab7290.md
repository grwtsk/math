## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5e434d4e2ca028b029b5b9efbb82141e843d1262e698b7d1018e3a1bb1bc91f4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 593–604.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class DistribMulActionSemiHomClass (F : Type*)
    {M N : outParam Type*} (φ : outParam (M → N))
    (A B : outParam Type*)
    [Monoid M] [Monoid N]
    [AddMonoid A] [AddMonoid B] [DistribMulAction M A] [DistribMulAction N B]
    [FunLike F A B] : Prop
    extends MulActionSemiHomClass F φ A B, AddMonoidHomClass F A B

/-- `DistribMulActionHomClass F M A B` states that `F` is a type of morphisms preserving
  the additive monoid structure and equivariant with respect to the action of `M`.
    It is an abbreviation to `DistribMulActionHomClass F (MonoidHom.id M) A B`
You should extend this class when you extend `DistribMulActionHom`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Hom/Variantd520ea08263066d2224a6a11ad9d50e1448f033eedf53f8e4017b9074dd74cc5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Hom/Variantd520ea08263066d2224a6a11ad9d50e1448f033eedf53f8e4017b9074dd74cc5.lean#L593).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e917791cd9952f7a22b9db6c34814674e7b08ac1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
