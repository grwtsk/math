## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b63686bc266ef474597cea221f3e912ab6e63bb1d846159f25b961b720298ffa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 425–454.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance commGroup {β} [CommGroup β]: CommGroup (A →*[n] β) :=
  { FreimanHom.commMonoid with
    div_eq_mul_inv := by
      intros
      ext
      apply div_eq_mul_inv
    mul_left_inv := by
      intros
      ext
      apply mul_left_inv}
#align freiman_hom.comm_group FreimanHom.commGroup
#align add_freiman_hom.add_comm_group AddFreimanHom.addCommGroup

end FreimanHom

--TODO: change to `MonoidHomClass F A β → FreimanHomClass F A β n` once `map_multiset_prod` is
-- generalized
/-- A monoid homomorphism is naturally a `FreimanHom` on its entire domain.

We can't leave the domain `A : Set α` of the `FreimanHom` a free variable, since it wouldn't be
inferrable. -/
@[to_additive AddMonoidHom.addFreimanHomClass
      " An additive monoid homomorphism is naturally an `AddFreimanHom` on its entire
      domain.

      We can't leave the domain `A : Set α` of the `AddFreimanHom` a free variable, since it
      wouldn't be inferrable."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Freiman/Variantce26be2a90e3fa04e54b652af2fbf516f2cfd52515f6bbd54dab991e18adc4fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Freiman/Variantce26be2a90e3fa04e54b652af2fbf516f2cfd52515f6bbd54dab991e18adc4fb.lean#L425).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `85787176970648026ac23eb1e2206b448897bd7b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
