## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e68516b2218ed7b3e719653831bfdd2d7bc4a8dd8a7a2486c71c33554f02d29d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 337–347.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance QuotientGroup.fg [Group.FG G] (N : Subgroup G) [Subgroup.Normal N] : Group.FG <| G ⧸ N :=
  Group.fg_of_surjective <| QuotientGroup.mk'_surjective N

end QuotientGroup

namespace Prod
variable [Monoid N]

open Monoid in
/-- The product of finitely generated monoids is finitely generated. -/
@[to_additive "The product of finitely generated monoids is finitely generated."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Finiteness/Variantfbd934d4f0fdf6147e5115d871e6379687cf244777b045ad59d2894dcd270593.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Finiteness/Variantfbd934d4f0fdf6147e5115d871e6379687cf244777b045ad59d2894dcd270593.lean#L337).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d68bccb21392b9b45bec632d8967377e941a231b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
