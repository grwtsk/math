## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:538413e7-4505-44a7-edbe-fb8826019e97`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 917–925.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- The product of `f y` over `y ∈ g '' s` equals the product of `f (g i)` over `s`
provided that `g` is injective on `s ∩ mulSupport (f ∘ g)`. -/

      /-- The sum of `f y` over `y ∈ g '' s` equals the sum of `f (g i)` over `s` provided that
      `g` is injective on `s ∩ support (f ∘ g)`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Finprod/Variantfbf36d4e85e3dc96ac1ece87de1e8471b35db813f6bc980b0f4f40e0a08b94da.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Finprod/Variantfbf36d4e85e3dc96ac1ece87de1e8471b35db813f6bc980b0f4f40e0a08b94da.lean#L917).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `59c7b9fbb6e2aa88d2b73affa83e503356bcad58` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
