## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ce5c212d1cf70e210ad154d7c6451b9e4e1c551b36e1c460bd66e0b62004f19e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class IsMultiplyPreprimitive (M α : Type*) [Group M] [MulAction M α] (n : ℕ) where
  /-- An `n`-preprimitive action is `n`-pretransitive. -/
  isMultiplyPretransitive (M α n) : IsMultiplyPretransitive M α n
  /-- In an `n`-preprimitive action, the action of `fixingSubgroup M s` on `ofFixingSubgroup M s`
  is preprimitive, for all sets `s` such that `s.encard + 1 = n`. -/
  isPreprimitive_ofFixingSubgroup (M n) {s : Set α} (hs : s.encard + 1 = n) :
    IsPreprimitive (fixingSubgroup M s) (ofFixingSubgroup M s)

variable (M α : Type*) [Group M] [MulAction M α]

@[to_additive]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/MultiplePrimitivity/Variant2e247e32ad2d1d66db1e1c90d5b7f55e06491317893d4cbf770f5127c7122c8c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/MultiplePrimitivity/Variant2e247e32ad2d1d66db1e1c90d5b7f55e06491317893d4cbf770f5127c7122c8c.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c6d8cdec8221628505254ecf73d93f1dbf22864` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
