## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c3d4b611fd4255c66060d5f8249a67ca4fae6100d75a0026dd1b68b5feb42b3e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 115–120.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def restr (f : Equidecomp X G) (A : Set X) : Equidecomp X G where
  toPartialEquiv := f.toPartialEquiv.restr A
  isDecompOn' := ⟨f.witness,
    f.isDecompOn.mono (source_restr_subset_source _ _) fun _ ↦ congrFun rfl⟩

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Equidecomp/Varianta1cec875ae78c35f50191734249c974d881324b47057b73cdd7bcd98728142e8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Equidecomp/Varianta1cec875ae78c35f50191734249c974d881324b47057b73cdd7bcd98728142e8.lean#L115).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `46600cabfab38113407f4441f2faa60bcaf790fe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
