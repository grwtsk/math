## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1549a63b45c90b290a2e42341107d84f0469204f8cac2914adca1fc095838463`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 178–184.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance addMonoidWithOne [AddMonoidWithOne α] : AddMonoidWithOne (ULift α) :=
  { ULift.one, ULift.addMonoid with
      natCast := fun n => ⟨n⟩
      natCast_zero := congr_arg ULift.up Nat.cast_zero,
      natCast_succ := fun _ => congr_arg ULift.up (Nat.cast_succ _) }
#align ulift.add_monoid_with_one ULift.addMonoidWithOne

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/ULift/Variant43614884d424ab1a8a7fef6b97fa2399ef3c13b756bf8b62e2f76e686af13d55.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/ULift/Variant43614884d424ab1a8a7fef6b97fa2399ef3c13b756bf8b62e2f76e686af13d55.lean#L178).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b0814ba3858c091295fb63c80a5949f83f25b5a9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
