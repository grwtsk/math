## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:85e0b7eb-8092-90c3-c67d-0d1b82ccd94d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 276–282.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coe_mul_of_right_le_normalizer_left (N H : Subgroup G) (hLE : H ≤ N.normalizer) :
    (↑(N ⊔ H) : Set G) = N * H := by
  rw [← set_mul_normalizer_comm _ _ hLE, sup_comm, coe_mul_of_left_le_normalizer_right _ _ hLE]

/-- The carrier of `H ⊔ N` is just `↑H * ↑N` (pointwise set product) when `N` is normal. -/
@[to_additive "The carrier of `H ⊔ N` is just `↑H + ↑N` (pointwise set addition)
when `N` is normal."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Pointwise/Variantfe9005cbda7d80a18d67451ada664cae208aee3a1592620cefa05945531bbdae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Pointwise/Variantfe9005cbda7d80a18d67451ada664cae208aee3a1592620cefa05945531bbdae.lean#L276).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `69f17308e6b72d3dcd99c04c51b742513f7eefac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
