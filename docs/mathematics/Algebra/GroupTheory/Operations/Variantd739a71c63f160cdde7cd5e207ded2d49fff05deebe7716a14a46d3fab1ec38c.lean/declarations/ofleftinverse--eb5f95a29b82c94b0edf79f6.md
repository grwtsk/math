## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ae0a7df770bb214d989c367508b24a033b34b2fd25e1ecf6e30cebba0aa1c012`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 974–991.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofLeftInverse' (f : M →* N) {g : N → M} (h : Function.LeftInverse g f) :
    M ≃* MonoidHom.mrange f :=
  { f.mrangeRestrict with
    toFun := f.mrangeRestrict
    invFun := g ∘ (MonoidHom.mrange f).subtype
    left_inv := h
    right_inv := fun x =>
      Subtype.ext <|
        let ⟨x', hx'⟩ := MonoidHom.mem_mrange.mp x.2
        show f (g x) = x by rw [← hx', h x'] }

/-- A `MulEquiv` `φ` between two monoids `M` and `N` induces a `MulEquiv` between
a submonoid `S ≤ M` and the submonoid `φ(S) ≤ N`.
See `MonoidHom.submonoidMap` for a variant for `MonoidHom`s. -/

      "An `AddEquiv` `φ` between two additive monoids `M` and `N` induces an `AddEquiv`
      between a submonoid `S ≤ M` and the submonoid `φ(S) ≤ N`. See
      `AddMonoidHom.addSubmonoidMap` for a variant for `AddMonoidHom`s."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Operations/Variantd739a71c63f160cdde7cd5e207ded2d49fff05deebe7716a14a46d3fab1ec38c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Operations/Variantd739a71c63f160cdde7cd5e207ded2d49fff05deebe7716a14a46d3fab1ec38c.lean#L974).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `14a7258d37edd4a861952d8497629bf826588ad3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
