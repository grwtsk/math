## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7682cfb9beb6820d06ee1b37582587534b19daa12421c51e6ca6e813de285e59`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 124–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def AddSubmonoid.toSubmonoid : AddSubmonoid A ≃o Submonoid (Multiplicative A) where
  toFun S :=
    { carrier := Multiplicative.toAdd ⁻¹' S
      one_mem' := S.zero_mem'
      mul_mem' := fun ha hb => S.add_mem' ha hb }
  invFun S :=
    { carrier := Multiplicative.ofAdd ⁻¹' S
      zero_mem' := S.one_mem'
      add_mem' := fun ha hb => S.mul_mem' ha hb}
  left_inv x := by cases x; rfl
  right_inv x := by cases x; rfl
  map_rel_iff' := Iff.rfl

/-- Submonoids of a monoid `Multiplicative A` are isomorphic to additive submonoids of `A`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Operations/Variant1f0da4fb68ec5a6f13cba11a159e7cf5b6c018c60ad96d549a7100d0967f75fd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Operations/Variant1f0da4fb68ec5a6f13cba11a159e7cf5b6c018c60ad96d549a7100d0967f75fd.lean#L124).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80aae71eb7463e4feeb75c9a35992df9092d976e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
