## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f33cb602-5401-e975-5f4f-a01f49bf8e35`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–136.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem AddSubmonoid.toSubmonoid'_closure (S : Set (Additive M)) :
    AddSubmonoid.toSubmonoid' (AddSubmonoid.closure S)
      = Submonoid.closure (Additive.ofMul ⁻¹' S) :=
  le_antisymm
    (AddSubmonoid.toSubmonoid'.le_symm_apply.1 <|
      AddSubmonoid.closure_le.2 (Submonoid.subset_closure (M := M)))
    (Submonoid.closure_le.2 <| AddSubmonoid.subset_closure (M := Additive M))

end

variable {A : Type*} [AddZeroClass A]

/-- Additive submonoids of an additive monoid `A` are isomorphic to
multiplicative submonoids of `Multiplicative A`. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Operations/Variant3f29a54a9a6089ddb99c5177597e30972cd6a999e762ec5068219b133622566f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Operations/Variant3f29a54a9a6089ddb99c5177597e30972cd6a999e762ec5068219b133622566f.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `771d0f88676a2f1e1679e76f0dd9594241434a59` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
