## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c55b4d6ad3c34df16d1528394bb32bb5d13fc4058ce8a55c37c0b805fb1913d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 744–750.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance toCommMonoid {M} [CommMonoid M] (S : Submonoid M) : CommMonoid S :=
  Subtype.coe_injective.commMonoid (↑) rfl (fun _ _ => rfl) fun _ _ => rfl
#align submonoid.to_comm_monoid Submonoid.toCommMonoid
#align add_submonoid.to_add_comm_monoid AddSubmonoid.toAddCommMonoid

/-- A submonoid of an `OrderedCommMonoid` is an `OrderedCommMonoid`. -/
@[to_additive "An `AddSubmonoid` of an `OrderedAddCommMonoid` is an `OrderedAddCommMonoid`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Operations/Variant29490f6ad391eada6b964349922c9c213287155dcf707e0db42850d314b01193.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Operations/Variant29490f6ad391eada6b964349922c9c213287155dcf707e0db42850d314b01193.lean#L744).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `889f97dea8be98bfb53d0ed2a7ec849bada3d1ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
