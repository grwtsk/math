## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a5f5a9d80d89ae1c2807effa0006c68d4bee1e2c2ebee7041a285770407f1bf7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1134–1144.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def codRestrict {S} [SetLike S N] [SubmonoidClass S N] (f : M →* N) (s : S) (h : ∀ x, f x ∈ s) :
    M →* s where
  toFun n := ⟨f n, h n⟩
  map_one' := Subtype.eq f.map_one
  map_mul' x y := Subtype.eq (f.map_mul x y)

#align monoid_hom.cod_restrict_apply MonoidHom.codRestrict_apply

/-- Restriction of a monoid hom to its range interpreted as a submonoid. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Operations/Variant29490f6ad391eada6b964349922c9c213287155dcf707e0db42850d314b01193.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Operations/Variant29490f6ad391eada6b964349922c9c213287155dcf707e0db42850d314b01193.lean#L1134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `889f97dea8be98bfb53d0ed2a7ec849bada3d1ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
