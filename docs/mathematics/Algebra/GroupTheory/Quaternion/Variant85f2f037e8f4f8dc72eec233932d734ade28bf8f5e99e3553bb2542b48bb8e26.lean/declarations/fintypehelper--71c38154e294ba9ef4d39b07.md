## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4ca25a08a95d3afb4b3e4b7fe067e6e2907fd28c4277c3ad862ed6ed119e221c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def fintypeHelper : ZMod (2 * n) ⊕ ZMod (2 * n) ≃ QuaternionGroup n where
  invFun i :=
    match i with
    | a j => Sum.inl j
    | xa j => Sum.inr j
  toFun i :=
    match i with
    | Sum.inl j => a j
    | Sum.inr j => xa j
  left_inv := by rintro (x | x) <;> rfl
  right_inv := by rintro (x | x) <;> rfl

/-- The special case that more or less by definition `QuaternionGroup 0` is isomorphic to the
infinite dihedral group. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quaternion/Variant85f2f037e8f4f8dc72eec233932d734ade28bf8f5e99e3553bb2542b48bb8e26.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quaternion/Variant85f2f037e8f4f8dc72eec233932d734ade28bf8f5e99e3553bb2542b48bb8e26.lean#L136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6bec925b9a2a3d0350b7c9263a651c0290bf74e0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
