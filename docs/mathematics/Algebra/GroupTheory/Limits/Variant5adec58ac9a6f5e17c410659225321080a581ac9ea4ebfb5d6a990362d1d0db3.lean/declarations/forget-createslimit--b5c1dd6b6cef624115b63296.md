## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:25aab853da2ea023fca24f680152c00a212312b2c853a87faaa51efe8ae21839`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 190–209.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance forget₂CreatesLimit (F : J ⥤ CommMonCatMax.{u,v}) :
    CreatesLimit F (forget₂ CommMonCat MonCatMax.{u, v}) :=
  createsLimitOfReflectsIso fun c' t =>
    { liftedCone :=
        { pt := CommMonCat.of (Types.limitCone (F ⋙ forget CommMonCat)).pt
          π :=
            { app := MonCat.limitπMonoidHom (F ⋙ forget₂ CommMonCatMax.{u,v} MonCatMax.{u,v})
              naturality :=
                (MonCat.HasLimits.limitCone
                      (F ⋙ forget₂ CommMonCat MonCat.{max v u})).π.naturality } }
      validLift := by apply IsLimit.uniqueUpToIso (MonCat.HasLimits.limitConeIsLimit _) t
      makesLimit :=
        IsLimit.ofFaithful (forget₂ CommMonCat MonCat.{max v u})
          (MonCat.HasLimits.limitConeIsLimit _) (fun s => _) fun s => rfl }

/-- A choice of limit cone for a functor into `CommMonCat`.
(Generally, you'll just want to use `limit F`.)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Limits/Variant5adec58ac9a6f5e17c410659225321080a581ac9ea4ebfb5d6a990362d1d0db3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Limits/Variant5adec58ac9a6f5e17c410659225321080a581ac9ea4ebfb5d6a990362d1d0db3.lean#L190).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2ef51a45cd0b54e762e9159e66d825dd59f9b482` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
