## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:51879eb36b6d9f5ec28ee6ccdcb65ff9c5b03d94b4b095dde93dc470368e3260`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 147–160.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance forgetPreservesLimits : PreservesLimits (forget MonCat.{u}) :=
  MonCat.forgetPreservesLimitsOfSize.{u, u}
#align Mon.forget_preserves_limits MonCat.forgetPreservesLimits
#align AddMon.forget_preserves_limits AddMonCat.forgetPreservesLimits

end MonCat

open MonCat

-- Porting note: typemax hack

/-- An alias for `CommMonCat.{max u v}`, to deal around unification issues. -/
@[to_additive (attr := nolint checkUnivs) AddCommMonCatMax
  "An alias for `AddCommMonCat.{max u v}`, to deal around unification issues."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Limits/Variant5adec58ac9a6f5e17c410659225321080a581ac9ea4ebfb5d6a990362d1d0db3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Limits/Variant5adec58ac9a6f5e17c410659225321080a581ac9ea4ebfb5d6a990362d1d0db3.lean#L147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2ef51a45cd0b54e762e9159e66d825dd59f9b482` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
