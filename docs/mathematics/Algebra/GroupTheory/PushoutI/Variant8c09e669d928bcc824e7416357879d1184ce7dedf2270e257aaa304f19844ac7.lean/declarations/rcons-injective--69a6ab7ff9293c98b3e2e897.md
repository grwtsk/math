## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c1723365-2020-972f-dd04-1c8eb9eec72a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 411–423.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rcons_injective {i : ι} : Function.Injective (rcons (d := d) i) := by
  rintro ⟨⟨head₁, tail₁⟩, _⟩ ⟨⟨head₂, tail₂⟩, _⟩
  simp only [rcons, NormalWord.mk.injEq, EmbeddingLike.apply_eq_iff_eq,
    Word.Pair.mk.injEq, Pair.mk.injEq, and_imp]
  rintro h₁ rfl h₃
  rw [← equiv_fst_mul_equiv_snd (d.compl i) head₁,
      ← equiv_fst_mul_equiv_snd (d.compl i) head₂,
    h₁, h₃]
  simp

/-- The equivalence between `NormalWord`s and pairs. We can turn a `NormalWord` into a
pair by taking the head of the `List` if it is in `G i` and multiplying it by the element of the
base group. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/PushoutI/Variant8c09e669d928bcc824e7416357879d1184ce7dedf2270e257aaa304f19844ac7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/PushoutI/Variant8c09e669d928bcc824e7416357879d1184ce7dedf2270e257aaa304f19844ac7.lean#L411).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e959329afe5777ba1c5ee22ee787160b8e89729a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
