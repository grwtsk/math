## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:23b0afb1918e1f265ea3221efdd36c11acbc873d721b6add5fb109f7b9256a2d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 251–263.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure _root_.GRWTSK.Algebra.GroupTheory.Transversal.Variante377c936e26bb06c4a0c8ee2c87218d870c5d56db2c336a9d613c010c548fdce.Monoid.PushoutI.NormalWord (d : Transversal φ) extends CoprodI.Word G where
  /-- Every `NormalWord` is the product of an element of the base group and a word made up
  of letters each of which is in the transversal. `head` is that element of the base group. -/
  head : H
  /-- All letter in the word are in the transversal. -/
  normalized : ∀ i g, ⟨i, g⟩ ∈ toList → g ∈ d.set i

/--
A `Pair d i` is a word in the coproduct, `Coprod G`, the `tail`, and an element of the group `G i`,
the `head`. The first letter of the `tail` must not be an element of `G i`.
Note that the `head` may be `1` Every letter in the `tail` must be in the transversal given by `d`.
Similar to `Monoid.CoprodI.Pair` except every letter must be in the transversal
(not including the head letter). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/PushoutI/Variant92e29d04338b326b8821cab96f2210dbd10e73e60eac84fbccd8536a52423ff7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/PushoutI/Variant92e29d04338b326b8821cab96f2210dbd10e73e60eac84fbccd8536a52423ff7.lean#L251).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `886fd98ef9c3e064abf5fed42fbbfa9bdae022e1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
