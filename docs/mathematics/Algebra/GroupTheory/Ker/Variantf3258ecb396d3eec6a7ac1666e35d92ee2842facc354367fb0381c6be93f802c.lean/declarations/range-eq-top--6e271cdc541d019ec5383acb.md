## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:501d866e-9480-1e57-c21c-748cfa06ecbf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 134–142.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem range_eq_top {N} [Group N] {f : G →* N} :
    f.range = (⊤ : Subgroup N) ↔ Function.Surjective f :=
  SetLike.ext'_iff.trans <| Iff.trans (by rw [coe_range, coe_top]) Set.range_eq_univ

@[deprecated (since := "2024-11-11")] alias range_top_iff_surjective := range_eq_top

/-- The range of a surjective monoid homomorphism is the whole of the codomain. -/
@[to_additive (attr := simp)
  "The range of a surjective `AddMonoid` homomorphism is the whole of the codomain."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Ker/Variantf3258ecb396d3eec6a7ac1666e35d92ee2842facc354367fb0381c6be93f802c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Ker/Variantf3258ecb396d3eec6a7ac1666e35d92ee2842facc354367fb0381c6be93f802c.lean#L134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a47c77ea50fd32465a64114617d1507c2cfda4cf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
