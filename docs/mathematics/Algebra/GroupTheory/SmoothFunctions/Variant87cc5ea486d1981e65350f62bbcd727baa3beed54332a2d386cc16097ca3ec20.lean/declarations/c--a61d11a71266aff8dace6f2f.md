## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dfc18c3f9b9dcfc43c719dfc9e29b3514e81910ffb2897335a8f71dbe516643e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 326–334.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def C : 𝕜 →+* C^∞⟮I, N; 𝓘(𝕜, A), A⟯ where
  toFun := fun c : 𝕜 => ⟨fun _ => (algebraMap 𝕜 A) c, smooth_const⟩
  map_one' := by ext; exact (algebraMap 𝕜 A).map_one
  map_mul' c₁ c₂ := by ext; exact (algebraMap 𝕜 A).map_mul _ _
  map_zero' := by ext; exact (algebraMap 𝕜 A).map_zero
  map_add' c₁ c₂ := by ext; exact (algebraMap 𝕜 A).map_add _ _

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/SmoothFunctions/Variant87cc5ea486d1981e65350f62bbcd727baa3beed54332a2d386cc16097ca3ec20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/SmoothFunctions/Variant87cc5ea486d1981e65350f62bbcd727baa3beed54332a2d386cc16097ca3ec20.lean#L326).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `30abc1a101585ed9c4a237ecb9ebd6572d38f632` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
