## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d12dcdc4-62c6-9530-ea64-2f0d507d0a37`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 398–409.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tsub_right_inj (hba : b ≤ a) (hca : c ≤ a) : a - b = a - c ↔ b = c :=
  Contravariant.AddLECancellable.tsub_right_inj Contravariant.AddLECancellable
    Contravariant.AddLECancellable hba hca
#align tsub_right_inj tsub_right_inj

variable (α)

/-- A `CanonicallyOrderedAddMonoid` with ordered subtraction and order-reflecting addition is
cancellative. This is not an instance as it would form a typeclass loop.

See note [reducible non-instances]. -/
@[reducible]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Canonical/Varianta8b25be65d0c797393057996682096928efe06dbb652550384db4c9b46fea567.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Canonical/Varianta8b25be65d0c797393057996682096928efe06dbb652550384db4c9b46fea567.lean#L398).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c3adcef18088bc9179bd47c28c51dee8772f4322` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
