## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0bf6728a-67c9-fef8-46a1-6d6417d95ffd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 170–203.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

## Pointwise image of the `fixedBy` set by a commuting group element

If two group elements `g` and `h` commute, then `g` fixes `h • x` (resp. `h +ᵥ x`)
if and only if `g` fixes `x`.

This is equivalent to say that if `Commute g h`, then `fixedBy α g ∈ fixedBy (Set α) h` and
`(fixedBy α g)ᶜ ∈ fixedBy (Set α) h`.

/--
If `g` and `h` commute, then `g` fixes `h • x` iff `g` fixes `x`.
This is equivalent to say that the set `fixedBy α g` is fixed by `h`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/FixedPoints/Variantd18cd3e893ffc7d7761d15fcf99c070b41a2fc09193d50213158108ab817200a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/FixedPoints/Variantd18cd3e893ffc7d7761d15fcf99c070b41a2fc09193d50213158108ab817200a.lean#L170).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3142750e6825a5ad4b607b744e62eae3673d9281` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
