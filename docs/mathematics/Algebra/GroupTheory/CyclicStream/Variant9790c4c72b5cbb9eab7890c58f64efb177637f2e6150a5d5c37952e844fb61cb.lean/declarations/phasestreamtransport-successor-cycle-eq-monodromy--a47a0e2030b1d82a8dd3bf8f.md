## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:57b2e6ff-e169-b89f-6fe8-434275448111`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 319–328.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem phaseStreamTransport_successor_cycle_eq_monodromy
    (system : StepSystem h) (p : CoverPhase h) :
    phaseStreamTransport (successorPhaseStream h p) system.step
        (cycleLength h) =
      Surface.Core.CyclicHolonomy.StepSystem.monodromy system p := by
  rw [phaseStreamTransport_successor_eq_forwardProduct]
  rfl

/-- Every finite stream transport is invertible, hence bijective on the fiber. -/
@[surface_novel, surface_published]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/CyclicStream/Variant9790c4c72b5cbb9eab7890c58f64efb177637f2e6150a5d5c37952e844fb61cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/CyclicStream/Variant9790c4c72b5cbb9eab7890c58f64efb177637f2e6150a5d5c37952e844fb61cb.lean#L319).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6a1cd880ff1a1d35b5c60d87f00671d55c6671c5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
