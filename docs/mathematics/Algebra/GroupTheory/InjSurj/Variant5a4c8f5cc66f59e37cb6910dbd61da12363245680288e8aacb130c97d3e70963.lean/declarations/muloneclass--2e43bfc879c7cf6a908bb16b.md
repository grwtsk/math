## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8f79e00247c607100a4f45196d17f392b7c5a53f49d263b528d9ddd9028158ab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 405–420.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def mulOneClass [MulOneClass M₁] (f : M₁ → M₂) (hf : Surjective f) (one : f 1 = 1)
    (mul : ∀ x y, f (x * y) = f x * f y) : MulOneClass M₂ :=
  { ‹One M₂›, ‹Mul M₂› with
    one_mul := hf.forall.2 fun x => by erw [← one, ← mul, one_mul],
    mul_one := hf.forall.2 fun x => by erw [← one, ← mul, mul_one] }
#align function.surjective.mul_one_class Function.Surjective.mulOneClass
#align function.surjective.add_zero_class Function.Surjective.addZeroClass

variable [Pow M₂ ℕ]

/-- A type endowed with `1` and `*` is a monoid, if it admits a surjective map that preserves `1`
and `*` to a monoid. See note [reducible non-instances]. -/
@[to_additive (attr := reducible)
"A type endowed with `0` and `+` is an additive monoid, if it admits a
surjective map that preserves `0` and `+` to an additive monoid. This version takes a custom `nsmul`
as a `[SMul ℕ M₂]` argument."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/InjSurj/Variant5a4c8f5cc66f59e37cb6910dbd61da12363245680288e8aacb130c97d3e70963.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/InjSurj/Variant5a4c8f5cc66f59e37cb6910dbd61da12363245680288e8aacb130c97d3e70963.lean#L405).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9b195f0645776128c58669d3e3b0a2b078f0e817` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
