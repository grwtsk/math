## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:eb6c471df9345ceb03e699f26785c4565c61c52d07fc005344deab1b54c5a0ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 74–86.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def leftCancelSemigroup [LeftCancelSemigroup M₂] (f : M₁ → M₂) (hf : Injective f)
    (mul : ∀ x y, f (x * y) = f x * f y) : LeftCancelSemigroup M₁ :=
  { hf.semigroup f mul with
    mul := (· * ·),
    mul_left_cancel := fun x y z H => hf <| (mul_right_inj (f x)).1 <| by erw [← mul, ← mul, H] }
#align function.injective.left_cancel_semigroup Function.Injective.leftCancelSemigroup
#align function.injective.add_left_cancel_semigroup Function.Injective.addLeftCancelSemigroup

/-- A type endowed with `*` is a right cancel semigroup, if it admits an injective map that
preserves `*` to a right cancel semigroup.  See note [reducible non-instances]. -/
@[to_additive (attr := reducible) "A type endowed with `+` is an additive right
cancel semigroup, if it admits an injective map that preserves `+` to an additive right cancel
semigroup."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/InjSurj/Variant5a4c8f5cc66f59e37cb6910dbd61da12363245680288e8aacb130c97d3e70963.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/InjSurj/Variant5a4c8f5cc66f59e37cb6910dbd61da12363245680288e8aacb130c97d3e70963.lean#L74).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9b195f0645776128c58669d3e3b0a2b078f0e817` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
