## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:24efeb56b4e57e4a8718b7d3535265279dc322a42424cc8a7b32136a4c99b105`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 162–171.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected abbrev cancelMonoid [CancelMonoid M₂] (f : M₁ → M₂) (hf : Injective f) (one : f 1 = 1)
    (mul : ∀ x y, f (x * y) = f x * f y) (npow : ∀ (x) (n : ℕ), f (x ^ n) = f x ^ n) :
    CancelMonoid M₁ :=
  { hf.leftCancelMonoid f one mul npow, hf.rightCancelMonoid f one mul npow with }

/-- A type endowed with `1` and `*` is a commutative monoid, if it admits an injective map that
preserves `1` and `*` to a commutative monoid.  See note [reducible non-instances]. -/
@[to_additive
"A type endowed with `0` and `+` is an additive commutative monoid, if it
admits an injective map that preserves `0` and `+` to an additive commutative monoid."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/InjSurj/Variant94e683d5630cabe2b8a92a9962d93b2330fff322fd30ce696ca377ea9b523e21.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/InjSurj/Variant94e683d5630cabe2b8a92a9962d93b2330fff322fd30ce696ca377ea9b523e21.lean#L162).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `94bc7fdeaa445e5c7334268f718554ca40814d41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
