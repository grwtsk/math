## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4ba5889ae638850aa6bff0fe0faeb24889d0c2fbaaf847453edf54ed76ab35c7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 138–147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def Function.Injective.monoidWithZero [Zero M₀'] [Mul M₀'] [One M₀'] [Pow M₀' ℕ]
    [MonoidWithZero M₀] (f : M₀' → M₀) (hf : Injective f) (zero : f 0 = 0) (one : f 1 = 1)
    (mul : ∀ x y, f (x * y) = f x * f y) (npow : ∀ (x) (n : ℕ), f (x ^ n) = f x ^ n) :
    MonoidWithZero M₀' :=
  { hf.monoid f one mul npow, hf.mulZeroClass f zero mul with }
#align function.injective.monoid_with_zero Function.Injective.monoidWithZero

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/InjSurj/Variant5d5a9515d50328a98df66768d7ccd6cc3bd091a3411c72ac5687e70118eed9fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/InjSurj/Variant5d5a9515d50328a98df66768d7ccd6cc3bd091a3411c72ac5687e70118eed9fb.lean#L138).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cef88b19cd6ae9593f9215b934b6c493e02fa859` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
