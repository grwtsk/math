## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c7c34e2462688a6828032bee6775793eb329a363dfe4d39dee4f3a45a27c3a9a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 447–459.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected abbrev involutiveInv {M₂ : Type*} [Inv M₂] [InvolutiveInv M₁] (f : M₁ → M₂)
    (hf : Surjective f) (inv : ∀ x, f x⁻¹ = (f x)⁻¹) : InvolutiveInv M₂ where
  inv := Inv.inv
  inv_inv := hf.forall.2 fun x => by rw [← inv, ← inv, inv_inv]

variable [Inv M₂] [Div M₂] [Pow M₂ ℤ]

/-- A type endowed with `1`, `*`, `⁻¹`, and `/` is a `DivInvMonoid` if it admits a surjective map
that preserves `1`, `*`, `⁻¹`, and `/` to a `DivInvMonoid`. See note [reducible non-instances]. -/
@[to_additive subNegMonoid
"A type endowed with `0`, `+`, unary `-`, and binary `-` is a
`SubNegMonoid` if it admits a surjective map that preserves `0`, `+`, unary `-`, and binary `-` to
a `SubNegMonoid`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/InjSurj/Variant674469a730bc6f8723779ed09ced3837059a4eba935b3841fd2c3847c9769802.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/InjSurj/Variant674469a730bc6f8723779ed09ced3837059a4eba935b3841fd2c3847c9769802.lean#L447).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8b4d81026a7c5e40ca912aea33b3a918edc5e0b3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
