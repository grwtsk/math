## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3044ddab-ac41-1bc4-17f9-eff67318e558`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 225–235.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Equiv.Perm.not_solvable (X : Type*) (hX : 5 ≤ Cardinal.mk X) :
    ¬IsSolvable (Equiv.Perm X) := by
  intro h
  have key : Nonempty (Fin 5 ↪ X) := by
    rwa [← Cardinal.lift_mk_le, Cardinal.mk_fin, Cardinal.lift_natCast, Cardinal.lift_id]
  exact
    Equiv.Perm.fin_5_not_solvable
      (solvable_of_solvable_injective (Equiv.Perm.viaEmbeddingHom_injective (Nonempty.some key)))
#align equiv.perm.not_solvable Equiv.Perm.not_solvable

end PermNotSolvable
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Solvable/Variant0382b1870fa523a4d133f12bd1d96ce3c7084fc2044ad639000f7c64f18c5f40.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Solvable/Variant0382b1870fa523a4d133f12bd1d96ce3c7084fc2044ad639000f7c64f18c5f40.lean#L225).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fa4613f2bafdf0dc87d60acbb53ef6f836635021` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
