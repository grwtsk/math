## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5c0f902a-7583-1e88-33d5-be124dbf8c8f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_derivedSeries_eq (hf : Function.Surjective f) (n : ℕ) :
    (derivedSeries G n).map f = derivedSeries G' n :=
  le_antisymm (map_derivedSeries_le_derivedSeries f n) (derivedSeries_le_map_derivedSeries hf n)
#align map_derived_series_eq map_derivedSeries_eq

end DerivedSeriesMap

end CommutatorMap

section Solvable

variable (G)

/-- A group `G` is solvable if its derived series is eventually trivial. We use this definition
  because it's the most convenient one to work with. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Solvable/Variant4e629f6728a54219546174078829570e840927756b520384a3a08a74e3108a66.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Solvable/Variant4e629f6728a54219546174078829570e840927756b520384a3a08a74e3108a66.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ec1a76ed6fe416bdc45377137673ddf8ae18ce1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
