## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8d0e3e47ada8c1b50e041eb21e48f79a8e50cfba23257130eaff9ac74c130df1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 379–400.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance MonoidHom.monoidHomClass : MonoidHomClass (M →* N) M N where
  coe f := f.toFun
  coe_injective' f g h := by
    cases f
    cases g
    congr
    apply FunLike.coe_injective'
    exact h
  map_mul := MonoidHom.map_mul'
  map_one f := f.toOneHom.map_one'
#align monoid_hom.monoid_hom_class MonoidHom.monoidHomClass
#align add_monoid_hom.add_monoid_hom_class AddMonoidHom.addMonoidHomClass

-- Porting note: we need to add an extra `to_additive`.
-- This is waiting on https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/660
attribute [to_additive existing] MonoidHomClass.toOneHomClass

/-- Turn an element of a type `F` satisfying `MonoidHomClass F M N` into an actual
`MonoidHom`. This is declared as the default coercion from `F` to `M →* N`. -/
@[to_additive (attr := coe)
"Turn an element of a type `F` satisfying `AddMonoidHomClass F M N` into an
actual `MonoidHom`. This is declared as the default coercion from `F` to `M →+ N`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Group/Variant327e4bff9e5dcb549ecff48cd8dba9dba86a7696891fc34e1dfc65d4bc366fa3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Group/Variant327e4bff9e5dcb549ecff48cd8dba9dba86a7696891fc34e1dfc65d4bc366fa3.lean#L379).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `52c49b8b81a338bc3faa867a4119e74986f0f8fb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
