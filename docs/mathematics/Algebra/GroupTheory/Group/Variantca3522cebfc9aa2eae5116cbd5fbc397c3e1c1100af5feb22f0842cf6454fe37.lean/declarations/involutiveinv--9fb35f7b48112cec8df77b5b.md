## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:67497fca0b1ccfc9be40a57370d22f2d8c5182a85776383b21fbd3e352107216`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 222–227.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected abbrev involutiveInv [InvolutiveInv β] [IsInvApply F α β] : InvolutiveInv F :=
  DFunLike.coe_injective.involutiveInv (fun (f : F) ↦ (f : α → β)) coe_inv

/-- A `FunLike` type with `1` and inverse is an `InvOneClass` if `β` is an `InvOneClass`. -/
@[to_additive /-- A `FunLike` type with `0` and negation is a `NegZeroClass` if `β` is a
`NegZeroClass`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Group/Variantca3522cebfc9aa2eae5116cbd5fbc397c3e1c1100af5feb22f0842cf6454fe37.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Group/Variantca3522cebfc9aa2eae5116cbd5fbc397c3e1c1100af5feb22f0842cf6454fe37.lean#L222).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0078f1dc9b74fe6764084ac1733cdf90d8433e8f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
