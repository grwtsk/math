## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c885265d594ecf6fef817fb2cf42e3ede0af4f40fffaf745047519ff89e52439`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 350–360.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def arrowMulDistribMulAction {G A B : Type*} [Group G] [MulAction G A] [Monoid B] :
    MulDistribMulAction G (A → B) where
  smul_one _ := rfl
  smul_mul _ _ _ := rfl
#align arrow_mul_distrib_mul_action arrowMulDistribMulAction

attribute [local instance] arrowMulDistribMulAction

/-- Given groups `G H` with `G` acting on `A`, `G` acts by
  multiplicative automorphisms on `A → H`. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Group/Variant074fe97ab6717b7951d2154f85d7a4cface934afbe8d02e6d00e18a73ba1dbf5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Group/Variant074fe97ab6717b7951d2154f85d7a4cface934afbe8d02e6d00e18a73ba1dbf5.lean#L350).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `33528194679fa6b43084b07def63e50147bca10b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
