## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ddabae0a-b727-be63-c444-5a84813aeb8b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 167–173.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma act_self_act_eq (x y : S) : x ◃ (x ◃ y) = x ◃ y := by
  have h : x ◃ (x ◃ y) = (x ◃ 1) ◃ (x ◃ y) := by rw [act_one]
  rw [h, ← Shelf.self_distrib, one_act]

/--
The associativity of a unital shelf comes for free.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quandle/Variant2c7a3783e2e77b19c7a9595468c15c0a390d5c11d95962b03fc2120a062c5fa3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quandle/Variant2c7a3783e2e77b19c7a9595468c15c0a390d5c11d95962b03fc2120a062c5fa3.lean#L167).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
