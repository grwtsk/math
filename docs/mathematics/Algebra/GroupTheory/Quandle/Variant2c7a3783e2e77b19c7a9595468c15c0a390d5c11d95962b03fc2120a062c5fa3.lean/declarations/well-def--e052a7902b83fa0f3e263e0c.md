## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5edefed2-ca5b-af36-b670-0be4435a6137`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 638–657.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem well_def {R : Type*} [Rack R] {G : Type*} [Group G] (f : R →◃ Quandle.Conj G) :
    ∀ {a b : PreEnvelGroup R},
      PreEnvelGroupRel' R a b → toEnvelGroup.mapAux f a = toEnvelGroup.mapAux f b
  | _, _, PreEnvelGroupRel'.refl => rfl
  | _, _, PreEnvelGroupRel'.symm h => (well_def f h).symm
  | _, _, PreEnvelGroupRel'.trans hac hcb => Eq.trans (well_def f hac) (well_def f hcb)
  | _, _, PreEnvelGroupRel'.congr_mul ha hb => by
    simp [toEnvelGroup.mapAux, well_def f ha, well_def f hb]
  | _, _, congr_inv ha => by simp [toEnvelGroup.mapAux, well_def f ha]
  | _, _, assoc a b c => by apply mul_assoc
  | _, _, PreEnvelGroupRel'.one_mul a => by simp [toEnvelGroup.mapAux]
  | _, _, PreEnvelGroupRel'.mul_one a => by simp [toEnvelGroup.mapAux]
  | _, _, PreEnvelGroupRel'.inv_mul_cancel a => by simp [toEnvelGroup.mapAux]
  | _, _, act_incl x y => by simp [toEnvelGroup.mapAux]

end toEnvelGroup.mapAux

/-- Given a map from a rack to a group, lift it to being a map from the enveloping group.
More precisely, the `EnvelGroup` functor is left adjoint to `Quandle.Conj`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quandle/Variant2c7a3783e2e77b19c7a9595468c15c0a390d5c11d95962b03fc2120a062c5fa3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quandle/Variant2c7a3783e2e77b19c7a9595468c15c0a390d5c11d95962b03fc2120a062c5fa3.lean#L638).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e18199575dd30a54e1624941f724a86b161fba2a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
