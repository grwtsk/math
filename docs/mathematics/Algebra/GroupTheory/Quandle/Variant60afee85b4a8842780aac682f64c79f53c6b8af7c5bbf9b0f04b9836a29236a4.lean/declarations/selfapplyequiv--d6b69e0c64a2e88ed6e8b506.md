## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:82cc498ee27a735c1429a672c906ac1c60897636045422c7818397d566358efa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 303–310.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def selfApplyEquiv (R : Type*) [Rack R] : R ≃ R where
  toFun x := x ◃ x
  invFun x := x ◃⁻¹ x
  left_inv x := by simp
  right_inv x := by simp

/-- An involutory rack is one for which `Rack.oppositeRack R x` is an involution for every x.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quandle/Variant60afee85b4a8842780aac682f64c79f53c6b8af7c5bbf9b0f04b9836a29236a4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Quandle/Variant60afee85b4a8842780aac682f64c79f53c6b8af7c5bbf9b0f04b9836a29236a4.lean#L303).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9531cb0a30ce31817293be23085f337956497c11` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
