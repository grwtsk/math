## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:605a23f27503f40a52f51af2af0d982acaafee842b6e5ad3f97fa334f9f2788d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–66.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def noncommCoprod (comm : ∀ m n, Commute (f m) (g n)) : M × N →ₙ* P where
  toFun mn := f mn.fst * g mn.snd
  map_mul' mn mn' := by simpa using (comm _ _).mul_mul_mul_comm _ _

/-- Variant of `MulHom.noncommCoprod_apply` with the product written in the other direction. -/
@[to_additive
  /-- Variant of `AddHom.noncommCoprod_apply`, with the sum written in the other direction -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/NoncommCoprod/Variantb8bd8807c8b7b0cdb012a81911ceeb90a743941d068f14df51f0585cde5fe54b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/NoncommCoprod/Variantb8bd8807c8b7b0cdb012a81911ceeb90a743941d068f14df51f0585cde5fe54b.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e029c0b9e087062e5d102c6030d3941f57dba40` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
