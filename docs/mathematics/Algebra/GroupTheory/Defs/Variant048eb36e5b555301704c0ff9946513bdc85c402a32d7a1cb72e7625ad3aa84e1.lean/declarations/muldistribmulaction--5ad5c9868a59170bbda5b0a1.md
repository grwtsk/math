## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:06293ad6d8b482d77c20e24903478d70ac3e3f9f4644aada7ce5b47cc1ef40c7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 989–1004.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class MulDistribMulAction (M : Type*) (A : Type*) [Monoid M] [Monoid A] extends
  MulAction M A where
  /-- Distributivity of `•` across `*` -/
  smul_mul : ∀ (r : M) (x y : A), r • (x * y) = r • x * r • y
  /-- Multiplying `1` by a scalar gives `1` -/
  smul_one : ∀ r : M, r • (1 : A) = 1
#align mul_distrib_mul_action MulDistribMulAction
#align mul_distrib_mul_action.ext MulDistribMulAction.ext
#align mul_distrib_mul_action.ext_iff MulDistribMulAction.ext_iff

export MulDistribMulAction (smul_one)

section

variable [Monoid M] [Monoid A] [MulDistribMulAction M A]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant048eb36e5b555301704c0ff9946513bdc85c402a32d7a1cb72e7625ad3aa84e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant048eb36e5b555301704c0ff9946513bdc85c402a32d7a1cb72e7625ad3aa84e1.lean#L989).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `90b6bdb127a3daef34af9220186b980e813ac7e2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
