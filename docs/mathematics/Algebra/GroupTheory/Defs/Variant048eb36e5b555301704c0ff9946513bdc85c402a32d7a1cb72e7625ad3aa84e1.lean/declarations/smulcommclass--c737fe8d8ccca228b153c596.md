## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:63999cd781a968bf439cca016d7e9bbd8c0e69d252d38650ee7ce7090d712a07`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 193–226.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

library_note "bundled maps over different rings"/--
Frequently, we find ourselves wanting to express a bilinear map `M →ₗ[R] N →ₗ[R] P` or an
equivalence between maps `(M →ₗ[R] N) ≃ₗ[R] (M' →ₗ[R] N')` where the maps have an associated ring
`R`. Unfortunately, using definitions like these requires that `R` satisfy `CommSemiring R`, and
not just `Semiring R`. Using `M →ₗ[R] N →+ P` and `(M →ₗ[R] N) ≃+ (M' →ₗ[R] N')` avoids this
problem, but throws away structure that is useful for when we _do_ have a commutative (semi)ring.

To avoid making this compromise, we instead state these definitions as `M →ₗ[R] N →ₗ[S] P` or
`(M →ₗ[R] N) ≃ₗ[S] (M' →ₗ[R] N')` and require `SMulCommClass S R` on the appropriate modules. When
the caller has `CommSemiring R`, they can set `S = R` and `smulCommClass_self` will populate the
instance. If the caller only has `Semiring R` they can still set either `R = ℕ` or `S = ℕ`, and
`AddCommMonoid.nat_smulCommClass` or `AddCommMonoid.nat_smulCommClass'` will populate
the typeclass, which is still sufficient to recover a `≃+` or `→+` structure.

An example of where this is used is `LinearMap.prod_equiv`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant048eb36e5b555301704c0ff9946513bdc85c402a32d7a1cb72e7625ad3aa84e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant048eb36e5b555301704c0ff9946513bdc85c402a32d7a1cb72e7625ad3aa84e1.lean#L193).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `90b6bdb127a3daef34af9220186b980e813ac7e2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
