## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c757849b10c7fb421efef96e09760a271e44d6b5cd4e6d8520141899b5bdcee8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 65–76.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance OrderedCancelCommMonoid.to_contravariantClass_left (M : Type*)
    [OrderedCancelCommMonoid M] :
    ContravariantClass M M (· * ·) (· < ·) where
  elim _ _ _ := OrderedCancelCommMonoid.lt_of_mul_lt_mul_left _ _ _
#align ordered_cancel_comm_monoid.to_contravariant_class_left OrderedCancelCommMonoid.to_contravariantClass_left
#align ordered_cancel_add_comm_monoid.to_contravariant_class_left OrderedCancelAddCommMonoid.to_contravariantClass_left

/- This instance can be proven with `by infer_instance`.  However, by analogy with the
instance `OrderedCancelCommMonoid.to_covariantClass_right` above, I imagine that without
this instance, some Type would not have a `ContravariantClass M M (function.swap (*)) (<)`
instance. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variantd1d94e90480ceddebfbb82cae145889512d384fdf8fcbc8c9677a317557a59f9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variantd1d94e90480ceddebfbb82cae145889512d384fdf8fcbc8c9677a317557a59f9.lean#L65).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `decba60056e607c4903cba3905ebd711d754300d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
