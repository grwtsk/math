## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6ca2027170d712328241e4b9debd85b4c612e5d8115fbc2c34379fd8f6536274`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 35–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class OrderedCancelCommMonoid (α : Type u) extends CommMonoid α, PartialOrder α where
  /-- Multiplication is monotone in an ordered cancellative commutative monoid. -/
  protected mul_le_mul_left : ∀ a b : α, a ≤ b → ∀ c : α, c * a ≤ c * b
  /-- Cancellation is compatible with the order in an ordered cancellative commutative monoid. -/
  protected le_of_mul_le_mul_left : ∀ a b c : α, a * b ≤ a * c → b ≤ c
#align ordered_cancel_comm_monoid OrderedCancelCommMonoid

attribute [to_additive OrderedCancelAddCommMonoid] OrderedCancelCommMonoid

section OrderedCancelCommMonoid

variable [OrderedCancelCommMonoid α] {a b c d : α}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variantd1d94e90480ceddebfbb82cae145889512d384fdf8fcbc8c9677a317557a59f9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variantd1d94e90480ceddebfbb82cae145889512d384fdf8fcbc8c9677a317557a59f9.lean#L35).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `decba60056e607c4903cba3905ebd711d754300d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
