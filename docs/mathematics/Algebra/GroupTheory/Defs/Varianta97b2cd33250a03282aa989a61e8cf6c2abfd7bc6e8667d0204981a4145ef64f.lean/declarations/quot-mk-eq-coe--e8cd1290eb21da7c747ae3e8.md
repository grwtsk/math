## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eb8314cc-7b76-134a-2ecf-844f63ead4de`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 220–227.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem quot_mk_eq_coe {M : Type*} [Mul M] (c : Con M) (x : M) : Quot.mk c x = (x : c.Quotient) :=
  rfl

-- Porting note (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/11215): TODO: restore `elab_as_elim`
/-- The function on the quotient by a congruence relation `c` induced by a function that is
    constant on `c`'s equivalence classes. -/
@[to_additive "The function on the quotient by a congruence relation `c`
induced by a function that is constant on `c`'s equivalence classes."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Varianta97b2cd33250a03282aa989a61e8cf6c2abfd7bc6e8667d0204981a4145ef64f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Varianta97b2cd33250a03282aa989a61e8cf6c2abfd7bc6e8667d0204981a4145ef64f.lean#L220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9a479ddfb5ef61861dfc3b8a388f0033678b4c26` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
