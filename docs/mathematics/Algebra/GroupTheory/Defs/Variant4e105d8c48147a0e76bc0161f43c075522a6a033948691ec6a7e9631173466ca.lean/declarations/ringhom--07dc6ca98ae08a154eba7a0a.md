## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e76a986592d137c9f42207c451cc339e654b7fc6c6e3ea3fadc453e14cfb4004`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 290–319.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure RingHom (α : Type*) (β : Type*) [NonAssocSemiring α] [NonAssocSemiring β] extends
  α →* β, α →+ β, α →ₙ+* β, α →*₀ β

/-- `α →+* β` denotes the type of ring homomorphisms from `α` to `β`. -/
infixr:25 " →+* " => RingHom

/-- Reinterpret a ring homomorphism `f : α →+* β` as a monoid with zero homomorphism `α →*₀ β`.
The `simp`-normal form is `(f : α →*₀ β)`. -/
add_decl_doc RingHom.toMonoidWithZeroHom

/-- Reinterpret a ring homomorphism `f : α →+* β` as a monoid homomorphism `α →* β`.
The `simp`-normal form is `(f : α →* β)`. -/
add_decl_doc RingHom.toMonoidHom

/-- Reinterpret a ring homomorphism `f : α →+* β` as an additive monoid homomorphism `α →+ β`.
The `simp`-normal form is `(f : α →+ β)`. -/
add_decl_doc RingHom.toAddMonoidHom

/-- Reinterpret a ring homomorphism `f : α →+* β` as a non-unital ring homomorphism `α →ₙ+* β`. The
`simp`-normal form is `(f : α →ₙ+* β)`. -/
add_decl_doc RingHom.toNonUnitalRingHom

section RingHomClass

/-- `RingHomClass F α β` states that `F` is a type of (semi)ring homomorphisms.
You should extend this class when you extend `RingHom`.

This extends from both `MonoidHomClass` and `MonoidWithZeroHomClass` in
order to put the fields in a sensible order, even though
`MonoidWithZeroHomClass` already extends `MonoidHomClass`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant4e105d8c48147a0e76bc0161f43c075522a6a033948691ec6a7e9631173466ca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant4e105d8c48147a0e76bc0161f43c075522a6a033948691ec6a7e9631173466ca.lean#L290).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a85899d6573801a37704fcdeaedbd1ba4b9baa8c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
