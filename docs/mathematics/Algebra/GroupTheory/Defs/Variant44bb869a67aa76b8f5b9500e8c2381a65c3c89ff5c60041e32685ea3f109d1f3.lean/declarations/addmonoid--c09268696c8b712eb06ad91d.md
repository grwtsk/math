## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:46bbdac9353e313b3b3604de4b4e6aa085e68db5e55cab54354c3ee2369a6828`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 594–610.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class AddMonoid (M : Type u) extends AddSemigroup M, AddZeroClass M where
  /-- Multiplication by a natural number. -/
  protected nsmul : ℕ → M → M := nsmulRec
  /-- Multiplication by `(0 : ℕ)` gives `0`. -/
  protected nsmul_zero : ∀ x, nsmul 0 x = 0 := by intros; rfl
  /-- Multiplication by `(n + 1 : ℕ)` behaves as expected. -/
  protected nsmul_succ : ∀ (n : ℕ) (x), nsmul (n + 1) x = x + nsmul n x := by intros; rfl
#align add_monoid AddMonoid

attribute [instance 150] AddSemigroup.toAdd
attribute [instance 50] AddZeroClass.toAdd

#align add_monoid.nsmul_zero' AddMonoid.nsmul_zero
#align add_monoid.nsmul_succ' AddMonoid.nsmul_succ

/-- A `Monoid` is a `Semigroup` with an element `1` such that `1 * a = a * 1 = a`. -/
@[to_additive]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant44bb869a67aa76b8f5b9500e8c2381a65c3c89ff5c60041e32685ea3f109d1f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant44bb869a67aa76b8f5b9500e8c2381a65c3c89ff5c60041e32685ea3f109d1f3.lean#L594).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `94f1c538b336da8cbfce2a2ff534e145fbae559c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
