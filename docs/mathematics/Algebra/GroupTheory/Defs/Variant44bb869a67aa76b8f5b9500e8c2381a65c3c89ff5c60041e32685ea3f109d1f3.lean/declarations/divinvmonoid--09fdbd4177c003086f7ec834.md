## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9f176cc282d9a424f916cf4958dc9e9734511c97a61baf98353cfa3b802c16e6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 875–896.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class DivInvMonoid (G : Type u) extends Monoid G, Inv G, Div G where
  protected div := DivInvMonoid.div'
  /-- `a / b := a * b⁻¹` -/
  protected div_eq_mul_inv : ∀ a b : G, a / b = a * b⁻¹ := by intros; rfl
  /-- The power operation: `a ^ n = a * ··· * a`; `a ^ (-n) = a⁻¹ * ··· a⁻¹` (`n` times) -/
  protected zpow : ℤ → G → G := zpowRec
  /-- `a ^ 0 = 1` -/
  protected zpow_zero' : ∀ a : G, zpow 0 a = 1 := by intros; rfl
  /-- `a ^ (n + 1) = a * a ^ n` -/
  protected zpow_succ' (n : ℕ) (a : G) : zpow (Int.ofNat n.succ) a = a * zpow (Int.ofNat n) a := by
    intros; rfl
  /-- `a ^ -(n + 1) = (a ^ (n + 1))⁻¹` -/
  protected zpow_neg' (n : ℕ) (a : G) : zpow (Int.negSucc n) a = (zpow n.succ a)⁻¹ := by intros; rfl
#align div_inv_monoid DivInvMonoid

/-- In a class equipped with instances of both `AddMonoid` and `Neg`, this definition records what
the default definition for `Sub` would be: `a + -b`.  This is later provided as the default value
for the `Sub` instance in `SubNegMonoid`.

We keep it as a separate definition rather than inlining it in `SubNegMonoid` so that the `Sub`
field of individual `SubNegMonoid`s constructed using that default value will not be unfolded at
`.instance` transparency. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant44bb869a67aa76b8f5b9500e8c2381a65c3c89ff5c60041e32685ea3f109d1f3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant44bb869a67aa76b8f5b9500e8c2381a65c3c89ff5c60041e32685ea3f109d1f3.lean#L875).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `94f1c538b336da8cbfce2a2ff534e145fbae559c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
