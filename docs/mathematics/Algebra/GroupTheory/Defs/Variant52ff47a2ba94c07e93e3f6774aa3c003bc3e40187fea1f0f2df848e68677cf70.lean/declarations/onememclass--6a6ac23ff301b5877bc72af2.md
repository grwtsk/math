## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:947fb94634c934749e4d2ea2e8647e9af1cb7d86d41aff216cf241a1dc8a6470`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–68.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class OneMemClass (S : Type*) (M : outParam Type*) [One M] [SetLike S M] : Prop where
  /-- By definition, if we have `OneMemClass S M`, we have `1 ∈ s` for all `s : S`. -/
  one_mem : ∀ s : S, (1 : M) ∈ s

export OneMemClass (one_mem)

/-- `ZeroMemClass S M` says `S` is a type of subsets `s ≤ M`, such that `0 ∈ s` for all `s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant52ff47a2ba94c07e93e3f6774aa3c003bc3e40187fea1f0f2df848e68677cf70.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant52ff47a2ba94c07e93e3f6774aa3c003bc3e40187fea1f0f2df848e68677cf70.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `97308e6d16215d5d170ef93facca68776b9874a7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
