## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4515c8023262ed0ea427f393aa0dcf21bfe8976a0f5e0771d99a5ed9db70c859`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 134–151.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class AddHomClass (F : Type*) (M N : outParam Type*) [Add M] [Add N] [FunLike F M N] : Prop where
  /-- The proposition that the function preserves addition -/
  map_add : ∀ (f : F) (x y : M), f (x + y) = f x + f y

-- Instances and lemmas are defined below through `@[to_additive]`.
end Add

section add_zero

/-- `M →+ N` is the type of functions `M → N` that preserve the `AddZero` structure.

`AddMonoidHom` is also used for group homomorphisms.

When possible, instead of parametrizing results over `(f : M →+ N)`,
you should parametrize over `(F : Type*) [AddMonoidHomClass F M N] (f : F)`.

When you extend this structure, make sure to extend `AddMonoidHomClass`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant75c37312a35d159fe1ebbb09629516f92fc6bb49a528fb71e19755330f1bac2b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant75c37312a35d159fe1ebbb09629516f92fc6bb49a528fb71e19755330f1bac2b.lean#L134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1c61d344e5dfa13d6c2c2af05988bb19768bccf0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
