## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:87252fdc2e18c3c66ce4253068e61922c9f3f39b0ca95cf1febc5de821001ded`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 916–930.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def MulHom.inverse [Mul M] [Mul N] (f : M →ₙ* N) (g : N → M)
    (h₁ : Function.LeftInverse g f)
    (h₂ : Function.RightInverse g f) : N →ₙ* M where
  toFun := g
  map_mul' x y :=
    calc
      g (x * y) = g (f (g x) * f (g y)) := by rw [h₂ x, h₂ y]
      _ = g (f (g x * g y)) := by rw [f.map_mul]
      _ = g x * g y := h₁ _

/-- If `M` and `N` have multiplications, `f` is a surjective multiplicative map,
and `M` is commutative, then `N` is commutative. -/
@[to_additive
/-- If `M` and `N` have additions, `f` is a surjective additive map,
and `M` is commutative, then `N` is commutative. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variantd52664f316c2cc3b8323f05b428ddfb4df5b48dc50b0d5e318f70c385255deeb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variantd52664f316c2cc3b8323f05b428ddfb4df5b48dc50b0d5e318f70c385255deeb.lean#L916).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `08ea8a26e80a36ecc853991ae0119013566ebdb1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
