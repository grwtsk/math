## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f4ba2be521a733cd0e555d32319f7b5d8086cfc31bf923811190d2198cf01ce4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 127–133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def numDenCasesOn'.{u} {C : ℚ → Sort u} (a : ℚ) (H : ∀ (n : ℤ) (d : ℕ), d ≠ 0 → C (n /. d)) :
    C a :=
  numDenCasesOn a fun n d h _ => H n d h.ne'

/-- Define a (dependent) function or prove `∀ r : ℚ, p r` by dealing with rational
numbers of the form `mk' n d` with `d ≠ 0`. -/
@[elab_as_elim]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant55d8147aae66cf29f38e84ec71d0303f5abb37228310f9704870a17efd997819.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant55d8147aae66cf29f38e84ec71d0303f5abb37228310f9704870a17efd997819.lean#L127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6cfe75c22ec9c6f6ac810b97a48a74d1c4d1a932` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
