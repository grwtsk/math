## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1c20695fb8b540f06cfccc460be18a460fcf6a4006d66f3c35f1ba3090771b1f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 237–245.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def liftOn {β} {c : Con M} (q : c.Quotient) (f : M → β) (h : ∀ a b, c a b → f a = f b) :
    β :=
  Quotient.liftOn' q f h

-- Porting note (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/11215): TODO: restore `elab_as_elim`
/-- The binary function on the quotient by a congruence relation `c` induced by a binary function
that is constant on `c`'s equivalence classes. -/
@[to_additive /-- The binary function on the quotient by a congruence relation `c`
induced by a binary function that is constant on `c`'s equivalence classes. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant8c261d24f6156a028e1c8a998d01c63b54f16b249874124a251445f8f4b2c7a3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant8c261d24f6156a028e1c8a998d01c63b54f16b249874124a251445f8f4b2c7a3.lean#L237).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e85153085a2a9a4befadf559b9a13ac81ad47ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
