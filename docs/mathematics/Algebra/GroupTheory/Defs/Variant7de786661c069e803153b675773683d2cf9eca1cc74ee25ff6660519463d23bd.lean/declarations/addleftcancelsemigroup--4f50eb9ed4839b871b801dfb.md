## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6965aa1974eb84096e2db5864135949285b3fa3ffe9d51b3ad200ec8732e46d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 379–391.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class AddLeftCancelSemigroup (G : Type u) extends AddSemigroup G where
  protected add_left_cancel : ∀ a b c : G, a + b = a + c → b = c
#align add_left_cancel_semigroup AddLeftCancelSemigroup
#align add_left_cancel_semigroup.ext AddLeftCancelSemigroup.ext
#align add_left_cancel_semigroup.ext_iff AddLeftCancelSemigroup.ext_iff

attribute [instance 75] AddLeftCancelSemigroup.toAddSemigroup -- See note [lower cancel priority]

attribute [to_additive] LeftCancelSemigroup

/-- Any `LeftCancelSemigroup` satisfies `IsLeftCancelMul`. -/
@[to_additive AddLeftCancelSemigroup.toIsLeftCancelAdd "Any `AddLeftCancelSemigroup` satisfies
`IsLeftCancelAdd`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant7de786661c069e803153b675773683d2cf9eca1cc74ee25ff6660519463d23bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variant7de786661c069e803153b675773683d2cf9eca1cc74ee25ff6660519463d23bd.lean#L379).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f003d088fa05a121539a5354348460eebb30bd5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
