## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e5ff23bd-e928-649c-5522-05a01ca9fb41`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 503–525.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  generalize hk : k + 1 = k'
  replace hk : k' ≠ 0 := by omega

    cases b <;> simp only [Nat.bit, cond_false, cond_true, ← Nat.two_mul, npowRec'_two_mul]
    rw [npowRec'_succ (by omega), npowRec'_two_mul, ← npowRec'_two_mul,
      ← npowRec'_mul_comm (by omega), mul_assoc]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variantd2826d4f51e7bcbd11cff996c635751cf7828612bef1bf5a39df08be26d2e660.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variantd2826d4f51e7bcbd11cff996c635751cf7828612bef1bf5a39df08be26d2e660.lean#L503).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9616cb3e7e2a09560f7e41c0b5ac43aef8caf9af` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
