## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:747b486d-7213-4d62-d3aa-89f306702396`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 586–590.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[to_additive] lemma left_inv_eq_right_inv (hba : b * a = 1) (hac : a * c = 1) : b = c := by
  rw [← one_mul c, ← hba, mul_assoc, hac, mul_one b]

-- the attributes are intentionally out of order. `zero_smul` proves `zero_nsmul`.
@[to_additive zero_nsmul, simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variantd2826d4f51e7bcbd11cff996c635751cf7828612bef1bf5a39df08be26d2e660.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variantd2826d4f51e7bcbd11cff996c635751cf7828612bef1bf5a39df08be26d2e660.lean#L586).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9616cb3e7e2a09560f7e41c0b5ac43aef8caf9af` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
