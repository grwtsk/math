## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cdc44f88d1856561a446a33659621b486a9d4d0e817f3a016d4108da5970b69d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1012–1022.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class DivisionMonoid (G : Type u) extends DivInvMonoid G, InvolutiveInv G where
  protected mul_inv_rev (a b : G) : (a * b)⁻¹ = b⁻¹ * a⁻¹
  /-- Despite the asymmetry of `inv_eq_of_mul`, the symmetric version is true thanks to the
  involutivity of inversion. -/
  protected inv_eq_of_mul (a b : G) : a * b = 1 → a⁻¹ = b

section DivisionMonoid

variable [DivisionMonoid G] {a b : G}

@[to_additive (attr := simp) neg_add_rev]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variantd2826d4f51e7bcbd11cff996c635751cf7828612bef1bf5a39df08be26d2e660.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variantd2826d4f51e7bcbd11cff996c635751cf7828612bef1bf5a39df08be26d2e660.lean#L1012).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9616cb3e7e2a09560f7e41c0b5ac43aef8caf9af` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
