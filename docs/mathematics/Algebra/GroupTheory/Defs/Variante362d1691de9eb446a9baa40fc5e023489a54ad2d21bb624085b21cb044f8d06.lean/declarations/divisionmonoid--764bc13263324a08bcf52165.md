## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5b2fbed3dcf11424cd8f0252102371c6a5c0a4d428e1a32b9fd6a77b25b60f8b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 359–374.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance divisionMonoid [DivisionMonoid α] : DivisionMonoid (WithZero α) :=
  { WithZero.divInvMonoid, WithZero.involutiveInv with
    mul_inv_rev := fun a b =>
      match a, b with
      | none, none => rfl
      | none, some b => rfl
      | some a, none => rfl
      | some a, some b => congr_arg some <| mul_inv_rev _ _,
    inv_eq_of_mul := fun a b ↦
      match a, b with
      | none, none => fun _ ↦ rfl
      | none, some b => fun _ ↦ by contradiction
      | some a, none => fun _ ↦ by contradiction
      | some a, some b => fun h ↦
        congr_arg some <| inv_eq_of_mul_eq_one_right <| Option.some_injective _ h }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variante362d1691de9eb446a9baa40fc5e023489a54ad2d21bb624085b21cb044f8d06.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Defs/Variante362d1691de9eb446a9baa40fc5e023489a54ad2d21bb624085b21cb044f8d06.lean#L359).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `06337bba5087b716585d0d60823a10c70aa655b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
