## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ab3b811b3ff3f7575b4a0fbd570e93cd159dcf50e302ab5fdd5cce5d35a017b4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 653–667.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev commMonoidOfExponentTwo [IsCancelMul G] (hG : Monoid.exponent G = 2) : CommMonoid G where
  mul_comm := mul_comm_of_exponent_two hG

end Monoid

section Group

variable [Group G]

/--
If `H` is a normal subgroup of `G`, then the exponent of `G ⧸ H` divides the exponent of `G`.
-/
@[to_additive
/-- If `H` is a normal additive subgroup of `G`, then the exponent of `G ⧸ H` divides the
exponent of `G`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Exponent/Varianteefa1a66bae11a275f016ef6d2aad6fe4e81e0ad5a00456946d7f67898f8d60f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Exponent/Varianteefa1a66bae11a275f016ef6d2aad6fe4e81e0ad5a00456946d7f67898f8d60f.lean#L653).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c86c5366a4495322423562f335e163c7c593612e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
