## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7caf93ff48cccab24249e6782c770f05af2c3a3f782a4f817de3c3bdff00ea60`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–81.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ExponentExists :=
  ∃ n, 0 < n ∧ ∀ g : G, g ^ n = 1

open scoped Classical in
/-- The exponent of a group is the smallest positive integer `n` such that `g ^ n = 1` for all
`g ∈ G` if it exists, otherwise it is zero by convention. -/
@[to_additive
/-- The exponent of an additive group is the smallest positive integer `n` such that
`n • g = 0` for all `g ∈ G` if it exists, otherwise it is zero by convention. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Exponent/Variant7535449fe771b72005c17c20b7e4f19fd77f86936e1ef320f11ad0b2bf137700.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Exponent/Variant7535449fe771b72005c17c20b7e4f19fd77f86936e1ef320f11ad0b2bf137700.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `150eeadb58b5a30e718cfbe9af487892f8c50d27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
