## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1d86a4603110b676f55e148eecf28b34cb5a310ce1d84e290d6cadaf44ef7fda`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 51–61.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure IsAddSubmonoid (s : Set A) : Prop where
  /-- The proposition that s contains 0. -/
  zero_mem : (0 : A) ∈ s
  /-- The proposition that s is closed under addition. -/
  add_mem {a b} : a ∈ s → b ∈ s → a + b ∈ s
#align is_add_submonoid IsAddSubmonoid

/-- `s` is a submonoid: a set containing 1 and closed under multiplication.
Note that this structure is deprecated, and the bundled variant `Submonoid M` should be
preferred. -/
@[to_additive]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Submonoid/Variantd1ea931742f3d7732ad48456813b56768b36548a5c283d9ddded5ab5864faf65.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Submonoid/Variantd1ea931742f3d7732ad48456813b56768b36548a5c283d9ddded5ab5864faf65.lean#L51).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6ed115176b334e3f03a238e4d3bd6594faf748c0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
