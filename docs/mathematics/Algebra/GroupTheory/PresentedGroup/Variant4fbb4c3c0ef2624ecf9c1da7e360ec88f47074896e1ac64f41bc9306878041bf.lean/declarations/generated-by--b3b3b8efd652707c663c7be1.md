## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:61d99251-dba5-cb4e-1f0e-d8363eba4224`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

section ToGroup

/-
Presented groups satisfy a universal property. If `G` is a group and `f : α → G` is a map such that
the images of `f` satisfy all the given relations, then `f` extends uniquely to a group homomorphism
from `PresentedGroup rels` to `G`.

variable {G : Type*} [Group G] {f : α → G} {rels : Set (FreeGroup α)}

local notation "F" => FreeGroup.lift f

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/PresentedGroup/Variant4fbb4c3c0ef2624ecf9c1da7e360ec88f47074896e1ac64f41bc9306878041bf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/PresentedGroup/Variant4fbb4c3c0ef2624ecf9c1da7e360ec88f47074896e1ac64f41bc9306878041bf.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dc1160834884601ee908cec64d5c9eb138b4c429` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
