## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a3f079584a7d2d105664e9de124f74f7f3a19992183e6e236b945f2df9d45d9b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 220–232.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def MulEquiv.abelianizationCongr : Abelianization G ≃* Abelianization H where
  toFun := Abelianization.map e.toMonoidHom
  invFun := Abelianization.map e.symm.toMonoidHom
  left_inv := by
    rintro ⟨a⟩
    simp
  right_inv := by
    rintro ⟨a⟩
    simp
  map_mul' := MonoidHom.map_mul _
#align mul_equiv.abelianization_congr MulEquiv.abelianizationCongr

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Abelianization/Varianta01953586be1204027f7a5cf74e0d44ebb5ca91b2402b56cbf8a5e358e45dd4a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Abelianization/Varianta01953586be1204027f7a5cf74e0d44ebb5ca91b2402b56cbf8a5e358e45dd4a.lean#L220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cb0df9725c3fc70c4730e9bd0ce3e5afc8ebbf9d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
