## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:51d0c600d01f36d587e87f2bd755f6c82d074236160d4741907acdcef5933722`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 85–96.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive _root_.AddSubgroup.IsSubnormal {G : Type*} [AddGroup G] : AddSubgroup G → Prop where
  /-- The whole additive subgroup `G` is subnormal in itself. -/
  | top : IsSubnormal (⊤ : AddSubgroup G)
  /-- An additive subgroup `H` is subnormal if there is a subnormal additive subgroup `K`
  containing `H` that is subnormal itself and such that `H` is normal in `K`. -/
  | step : ∀ H K, (h_le : H ≤ K) → (hSubn : IsSubnormal K) → (hN : (H.addSubgroupOf K).Normal) →
    IsSubnormal H

attribute [simp] Subgroup.IsSubnormal.top

/-- A normal subgroup is subnormal. -/
@[to_additive /-- A normal additive subgroup is subnormal. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/IsSubnormal/Variant78ab4c2ec2a4d17c156c3aaed826ce9f43afa79c4c0b93e940688cc51f6355ad.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/IsSubnormal/Variant78ab4c2ec2a4d17c156c3aaed826ce9f43afa79c4c0b93e940688cc51f6355ad.lean#L85).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `880d7813b14732058ff59505c84e821e6442eab9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
