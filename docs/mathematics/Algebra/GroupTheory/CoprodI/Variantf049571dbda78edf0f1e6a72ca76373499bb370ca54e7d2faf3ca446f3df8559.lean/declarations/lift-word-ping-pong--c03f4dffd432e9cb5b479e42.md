## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ebe43d1e-6895-4f64-08ae-96219f3fc5ee`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 823–835.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lift_word_ping_pong {i j k} (w : NeWord H i j) (hk : j ≠ k) :
    lift f w.prod • X k ⊆ X i := by
  induction w generalizing k with
  | singleton x hne_one => simpa using hpp hk _ hne_one
  | @append i j k l w₁ hne w₂ hIw₁ hIw₂ =>
    calc
      lift f (NeWord.append w₁ hne w₂).prod • X k = lift f w₁.prod • lift f w₂.prod • X k := by
        simp [mul_smul]
      _ ⊆ lift f w₁.prod • X _ := smul_set_subset_smul_set_iff.mpr (hIw₂ hk)
      _ ⊆ X i := hIw₁ hne

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/CoprodI/Variantf049571dbda78edf0f1e6a72ca76373499bb370ca54e7d2faf3ca446f3df8559.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/CoprodI/Variantf049571dbda78edf0f1e6a72ca76373499bb370ca54e7d2faf3ca446f3df8559.lean#L823).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `faae9fbe0da89dd14edad39462e48e55bb4b8171` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
