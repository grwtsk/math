## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:88ff4144ec09ad95c8e8014388ebf609c137d26ac45608dee10630ee9dc89dbb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–42.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [∀ i, DecompositionMonoid (G i)] : DecompositionMonoid (∀ i, G i) where
  primal a b c h := by
    simp_rw [pi_dvd_iff] at h ⊢
    choose a₁ a₂ h₁ h₂ eq using fun i ↦ DecompositionMonoid.primal _ (h i)
    exact ⟨a₁, a₂, h₁, h₂, funext eq⟩
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Prod/Variant5d7b3468c286e92c9aea05bce4b31281f22c5cbc3df2807661c31340297f5f7d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Prod/Variant5d7b3468c286e92c9aea05bce4b31281f22c5cbc3df2807661c31340297f5f7d.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `355b2cfd6033daa6d63d8c8facc81d5cf63385ed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
