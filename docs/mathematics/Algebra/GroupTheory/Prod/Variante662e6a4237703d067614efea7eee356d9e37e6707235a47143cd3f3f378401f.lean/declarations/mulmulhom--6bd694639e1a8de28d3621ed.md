## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0b3f034fbb58c76f3262b0eb1cf7c0e6278b9fe34a4c39736d423877a0c26398`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 821–831.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mulMulHom [CommSemigroup α] :
    α × α →ₙ* α where
  toFun a := a.1 * a.2
  map_mul' _ _ := mul_mul_mul_comm _ _ _ _
#align mul_mul_hom mulMulHom
#align add_add_hom addAddHom
#align mul_mul_hom_apply mulMulHom_apply
#align add_add_hom_apply addAddHom_apply

/-- Multiplication as a monoid homomorphism. -/
@[to_additive (attr := simps) "Addition as an additive monoid homomorphism."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Prod/Variante662e6a4237703d067614efea7eee356d9e37e6707235a47143cd3f3f378401f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Prod/Variante662e6a4237703d067614efea7eee356d9e37e6707235a47143cd3f3f378401f.lean#L821).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `652f478cb23c07fee184650d53dd730d10c761a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
