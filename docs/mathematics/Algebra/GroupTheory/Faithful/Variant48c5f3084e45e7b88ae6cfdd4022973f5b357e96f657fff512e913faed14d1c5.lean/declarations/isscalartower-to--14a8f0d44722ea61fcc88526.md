## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d0a9e774-1653-959a-24b5-ca30db61cee1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–125.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    [SMul M N] [SMul M P] [SMul M Q] [SMul N P] [SMul N Q] [SMul P Q] [FaithfulSMul P Q]
    [IsScalarTower M N Q] [IsScalarTower M P Q] [IsScalarTower N P Q] : IsScalarTower M N P where
  smul_assoc m n p := by simp_rw [← (smul_left_injective' (α := Q)).eq_iff, smul_assoc]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Faithful/Variant48c5f3084e45e7b88ae6cfdd4022973f5b357e96f657fff512e913faed14d1c5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Faithful/Variant48c5f3084e45e7b88ae6cfdd4022973f5b357e96f657fff512e913faed14d1c5.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5efcb6287cb7009e8d50f4ee2bfd1ce76f65d65f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
