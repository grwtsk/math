## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2dba4b72793802d85d2bd793e59e9521ca6f59b333306e7709e0b61c39d31edc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–61.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class FaithfulSMul (M : Type*) (α : Type*) [SMul M α] : Prop where
  /-- Two elements `m₁` and `m₂` are equal whenever they act in the same way on all points. -/
  eq_of_smul_eq_smul : ∀ {m₁ m₂ : M}, (∀ a : α, m₁ • a = m₂ • a) → m₁ = m₂

export FaithfulSMul (eq_of_smul_eq_smul)
export FaithfulVAdd (eq_of_vadd_eq_vadd)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Faithful/Variant24e9171a27f31c343af23028e45ab2278d37a5f4c5fd3c121a40bc4d53972e1d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Faithful/Variant24e9171a27f31c343af23028e45ab2278d37a5f4c5fd3c121a40bc4d53972e1d.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `83eae5f921866fd801de14d28d5ea312e0707187` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
