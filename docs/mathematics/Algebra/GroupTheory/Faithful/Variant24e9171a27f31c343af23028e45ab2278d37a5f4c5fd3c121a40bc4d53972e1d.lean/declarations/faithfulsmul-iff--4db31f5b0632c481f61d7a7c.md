## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5622ce28-9d14-90a2-4e8f-08458e325f3c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–106.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem faithfulSMul_iff [Group G] [MulAction G α] :
    FaithfulSMul G α ↔ (∀ g : G, (∀ a : α, g • a = a) → g = 1) := by
  refine ⟨fun h a ha ↦ h.eq_of_smul_eq_smul ?_, fun h ↦ ⟨fun {a₁ a₂} h' ↦ ?_⟩⟩
  · simpa only [one_smul]
  · rw [← inv_inv a₂, eq_inv_of_mul_eq_one_left (h (a₂⁻¹ * a₁) ?_), inv_inv]
    simpa only [mul_smul, inv_smul_eq_iff] using h'

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Faithful/Variant24e9171a27f31c343af23028e45ab2278d37a5f4c5fd3c121a40bc4d53972e1d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Faithful/Variant24e9171a27f31c343af23028e45ab2278d37a5f4c5fd3c121a40bc4d53972e1d.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `83eae5f921866fd801de14d28d5ea312e0707187` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
