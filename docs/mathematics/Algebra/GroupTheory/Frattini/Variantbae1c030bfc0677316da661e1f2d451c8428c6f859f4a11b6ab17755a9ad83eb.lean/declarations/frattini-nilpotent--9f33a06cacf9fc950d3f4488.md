## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b8b39467-f820-ff6f-14d3-f54f5e3ddf50`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem frattini_nilpotent [Finite G] : Group.IsNilpotent (frattini G) := by
  -- We use the characterisation of nilpotency in terms of all Sylow subgroups being normal.
  have q := (Group.isNilpotent_of_finite_tfae (G := frattini G)).out 1 4
  rw [q]; clear q
  -- Consider each prime `p` and Sylow `p`-subgroup `P` of `frattini G`.
  intro p p_prime P
  -- The Frattini argument shows that the normalizer of `P` in `G`
  -- together with `frattini G` generates `G`.
  have frattini_argument := Sylow.normalizer_sup_eq_top P
  -- and hence by the nongenerating property of the Frattini subgroup that
  -- the normalizer of `P` in `G` is `G`.
  have normalizer_P := frattini_nongenerating frattini_argument
  -- This means that `P` is normal as a subgroup of `G`
  have P_normal_in_G : (map (frattini G).subtype P).Normal := normalizer_eq_top_iff.mp normalizer_P
  -- and hence also as a subgroup of `frattini G`, which was the remaining goal.
  exact P_normal_in_G.of_map_subtype
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Frattini/Variantbae1c030bfc0677316da661e1f2d451c8428c6f859f4a11b6ab17755a9ad83eb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Frattini/Variantbae1c030bfc0677316da661e1f2d451c8428c6f859f4a11b6ab17755a9ad83eb.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aba68a884f6c4c5dc080a33daa32a4dced65f520` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
