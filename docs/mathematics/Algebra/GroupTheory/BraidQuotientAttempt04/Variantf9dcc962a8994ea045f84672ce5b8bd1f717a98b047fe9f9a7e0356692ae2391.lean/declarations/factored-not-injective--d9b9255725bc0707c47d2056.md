## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:85a98733-7af5-a702-615c-9b4a36401a45`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–219.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem factored_not_injective {H:Type*} [Group H] (rho:B3→*H)
    (hrho:FactorsThrough rho) : ¬Function.Injective rho := by
  intro h
  have hb := factored_lostBraid_blindness rho hrho 1
  simp only [one_mul] at hb
  exact lostBraid_ne_one (h hb)

end ContinuousResearch.BraidQuotient
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/BraidQuotientAttempt04/Variantf9dcc962a8994ea045f84672ce5b8bd1f717a98b047fe9f9a7e0356692ae2391.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/BraidQuotientAttempt04/Variantf9dcc962a8994ea045f84672ce5b8bd1f717a98b047fe9f9a7e0356692ae2391.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cf1a7441b52f8d01cd0c19c49fdb6ea88e838a9b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
