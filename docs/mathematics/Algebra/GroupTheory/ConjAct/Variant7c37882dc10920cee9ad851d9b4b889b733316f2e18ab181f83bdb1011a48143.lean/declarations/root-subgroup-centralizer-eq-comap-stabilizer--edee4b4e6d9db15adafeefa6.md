## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b98d724d-df8a-2b15-0ad0-092240dfd441`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–223.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem _root_.Subgroup.centralizer_eq_comap_stabilizer (g : G) :
    Subgroup.centralizer {g} = Subgroup.comap ConjAct.toConjAct.toMonoidHom
      (MulAction.stabilizer (ConjAct G) g) := by
  ext k
-- NOTE: `Subgroup.mem_centralizer_iff` should probably be stated
-- with the equality in the other direction
  simp only [mem_centralizer_iff, Set.mem_singleton_iff, forall_eq, ConjAct.toConjAct_smul]
  rw [eq_comm]
  exact Iff.symm mul_inv_eq_iff_eq_mul

/-- As normal subgroups are closed under conjugation, they inherit the conjugation action
  of the underlying group. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/ConjAct/Variant7c37882dc10920cee9ad851d9b4b889b733316f2e18ab181f83bdb1011a48143.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/ConjAct/Variant7c37882dc10920cee9ad851d9b4b889b733316f2e18ab181f83bdb1011a48143.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `07db7b0b02891091a89e5c802545d49681c7030e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
