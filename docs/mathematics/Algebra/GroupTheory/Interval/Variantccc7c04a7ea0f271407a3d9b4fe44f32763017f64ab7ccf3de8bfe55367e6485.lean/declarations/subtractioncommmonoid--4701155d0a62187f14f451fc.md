## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b71e7c5f388861a9e0eece186bf9282f8a9a5ff64352dbef0dd050099225cfad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 591–606.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance subtractionCommMonoid {α : Type u} [OrderedAddCommGroup α] :
    SubtractionCommMonoid (Interval α) :=
  { Interval.addCommMonoid with
    neg := Neg.neg
    sub := Sub.sub
    sub_eq_add_neg := by
      rintro (_ | s) (_ | t) <;> first |rfl|exact congr_arg some (sub_eq_add_neg _ _)
    neg_neg := by rintro (_ | s) <;> first |rfl|exact congr_arg some (neg_neg _)
    neg_add_rev := by rintro (_ | s) (_ | t) <;> first |rfl|exact congr_arg some (neg_add_rev _ _)
    neg_eq_of_add := by
      rintro (_ | s) (_ | t) h <;>
        first
          | cases h
          | exact congr_arg some (neg_eq_of_add_eq_zero_right <| Option.some_injective _ h) }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Interval/Variantccc7c04a7ea0f271407a3d9b4fe44f32763017f64ab7ccf3de8bfe55367e6485.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Interval/Variantccc7c04a7ea0f271407a3d9b4fe44f32763017f64ab7ccf3de8bfe55367e6485.lean#L591).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d26ed32e73b9e9a6ea4926c0674194b3eef321a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
