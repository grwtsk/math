## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1b600e78-9f44-785b-e1c6-75ad9e6d58ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 275–280.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem transferSylow_restrict_eq_pow : ⇑((transferSylow P hP).restrict (P : Subgroup G)) =
    (fun x : P => x ^ (P : Subgroup G).index) :=
  funext fun g => transferSylow_eq_pow P hP g g.2

/-- **Burnside's normal p-complement theorem**: If `N(P) ≤ C(P)`, then `P` has a normal
complement. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Algebra/GroupTheory/Transfer/Variant4f98b3f670d9a2045c7c716112127eb57f928ae952e19c5e96bfbf4748abd311.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/GroupTheory/Transfer/Variant4f98b3f670d9a2045c7c716112127eb57f928ae952e19c5e96bfbf4748abd311.lean#L275).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f33ef53ddbda61c4e97a059161c54ab54a70be53` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
