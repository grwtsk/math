## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:05f3b4eb-814f-0705-5ada-5ef1f2626ca8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 138–147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Ideal.comap_minimalPrimes_eq_of_surjective {f : R →+* S} (hf : Function.Surjective f)
    (I : Ideal S) : (I.comap f).minimalPrimes = Ideal.comap f '' I.minimalPrimes := by
  ext J
  constructor
  · intro H
    obtain ⟨p, h, rfl⟩ := Ideal.exists_minimalPrimes_comap_eq f J H
    exact ⟨p, h, rfl⟩
  · rintro ⟨J, hJ, rfl⟩
    exact Ideal.minimal_primes_comap_of_surjective hf hJ

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Localization/Variantd3474e0f8fdba7a1c477b84ed900597332b15c2862ada44f41c38505d22a495f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Localization/Variantd3474e0f8fdba7a1c477b84ed900597332b15c2862ada44f41c38505d22a495f.lean#L138).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d47630b9103bcada6637ecd93b0b8734bd7fe2d6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
