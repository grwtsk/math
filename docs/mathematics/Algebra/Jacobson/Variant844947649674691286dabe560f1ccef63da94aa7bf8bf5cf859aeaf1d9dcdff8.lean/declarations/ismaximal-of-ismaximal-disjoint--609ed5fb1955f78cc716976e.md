## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a25a97e3-d61d-cc84-8ecb-f74505960002`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 222–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isMaximal_of_isMaximal_disjoint [IsJacobson R] (I : Ideal R) (hI : I.IsMaximal)
    (hy : y ∉ I) : (map (algebraMap R S) I).IsMaximal := by
  rw [isMaximal_iff_isMaximal_disjoint S y,
    comap_map_of_isPrime_disjoint (powers y) S I (IsMaximal.isPrime hI)

  exact ⟨hI, hy⟩
#align ideal.is_maximal_of_is_maximal_disjoint Ideal.isMaximal_of_isMaximal_disjoint

/-- If `R` is a Jacobson ring, then maximal ideals in the localization at `y`
correspond to maximal ideals in the original ring `R` that don't contain `y` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Jacobson/Variant844947649674691286dabe560f1ccef63da94aa7bf8bf5cf859aeaf1d9dcdff8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Jacobson/Variant844947649674691286dabe560f1ccef63da94aa7bf8bf5cf859aeaf1d9dcdff8.lean#L222).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e8468b041b4419287f77937e8b89c347f23bf87f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
