## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ed4d3252-f86a-a854-6e12-9ca0e5a64e4a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 98–111.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem shrinking_collar_center (beta : Rat)
    (collars : ∀ epsilon : Rat, 0 < epsilon →
       1/2-epsilon ≤ beta ∧ beta ≤ 1/2+epsilon) : beta = 1/2 := by
  by_cases h : beta = 1/2
  · exact h
  · exfalso
    by_cases hi : (1/2 : Rat) < beta
    · have hp : 0 < (beta-1/2)/2 := by grind
      have hh := collars ((beta-1/2)/2) hp
      grind
    · have hp : 0 < (1/2-beta)/2 := by grind
      have hh := collars ((1/2-beta)/2) hp
      grind

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Polynomial/Heat.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Polynomial/Heat.lean#L98).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5c7c40d6b2e32ff8b2a39e0876bf316567b4e73d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
