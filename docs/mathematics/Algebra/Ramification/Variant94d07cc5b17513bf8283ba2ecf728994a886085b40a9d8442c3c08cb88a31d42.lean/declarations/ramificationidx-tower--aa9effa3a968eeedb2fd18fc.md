## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8e8e2ffb-373e-1924-373d-8bac4f2002d0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 222–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ramificationIdx_tower [r.LiesOver q] [Module.Flat S T] :
    r.ramificationIdx R = q.ramificationIdx R * r.ramificationIdx S := by
  by_cases hr : r.IsPrime
  · have : q.IsPrime := isPrime_of_liesOver r q
    let := Localization.AtPrime.algebraOfLiesOver q r
    apply ramificationIdx_tower'
  · rw [ramificationIdx_of_not_isPrime r R hr, ramificationIdx_of_not_isPrime r S hr, mul_zero]

@[deprecated (since := "2026-07-01")] alias ramificationIdx'_tower := ramificationIdx_tower

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Ramification/Variant94d07cc5b17513bf8283ba2ecf728994a886085b40a9d8442c3c08cb88a31d42.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Ramification/Variant94d07cc5b17513bf8283ba2ecf728994a886085b40a9d8442c3c08cb88a31d42.lean#L222).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b03b00f0a11e4dac24dd38293fa2c12c315cf439` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
