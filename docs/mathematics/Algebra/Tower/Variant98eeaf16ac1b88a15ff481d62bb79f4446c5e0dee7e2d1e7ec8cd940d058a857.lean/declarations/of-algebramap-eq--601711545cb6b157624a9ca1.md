## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:784cd2cc-0326-d15d-0283-2a1bf7c86b17`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem of_algebraMap_eq [Algebra R A]
    (h : ∀ x, algebraMap R A x = algebraMap S A (algebraMap R S x)) : IsScalarTower R S A :=
  ⟨fun x y z => by simp_rw [Algebra.smul_def, RingHom.map_mul, mul_assoc, h]⟩
#align is_scalar_tower.of_algebra_map_eq IsScalarTower.of_algebraMap_eq

/-- See note [partially-applied ext lemmas]. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Tower/Variant98eeaf16ac1b88a15ff481d62bb79f4446c5e0dee7e2d1e7ec8cd940d058a857.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Tower/Variant98eeaf16ac1b88a15ff481d62bb79f4446c5e0dee7e2d1e7ec8cd940d058a857.lean#L113).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ccbbf562619b9f237a0807bf6bfc286ca2c4923c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
