## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d923a403-8a70-fcf3-a496-aafa15846df3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 274–280.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem smul_mem_span_smul_of_mem {s : Set S} {t : Set A} {k : S} (hks : k ∈ span R s) {x : A}
    (hx : x ∈ t) : k • x ∈ span R (s • t) :=
  span_induction (fun _ hc => subset_span <| Set.smul_mem_smul hc hx)
    (by rw [zero_smul]; exact zero_mem _)
    (fun c₁ c₂ _ _ ih₁ ih₂ => by rw [add_smul]; exact add_mem ih₁ ih₂)
    (fun b c _ hc => by rw [IsScalarTower.smul_assoc]; exact smul_mem _ _ hc) hks

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Tower/Variant3ecbf285119d77146ab363ed234a5d330ab0a72c925aebc5cc1fc22b1b397731.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Tower/Variant3ecbf285119d77146ab363ed234a5d330ab0a72c925aebc5cc1fc22b1b397731.lean#L274).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb393b63f16e57c6818b88bd36bda4e5a47ce5af` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
