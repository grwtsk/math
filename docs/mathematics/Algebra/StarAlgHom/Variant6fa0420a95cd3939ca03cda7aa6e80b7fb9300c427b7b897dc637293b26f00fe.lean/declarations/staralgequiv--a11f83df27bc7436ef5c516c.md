## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d70259e5ed9eb67ca21e2c0f6ed29805cbe8cbdebe8c7413d7d9e2d6e4ee4901`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 684–703.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure StarAlgEquiv (R A B : Type*) [Add A] [Add B] [Mul A] [Mul B] [SMul R A] [SMul R B]
  [Star A] [Star B] extends A ≃+* B where
  /-- By definition, a ⋆-algebra equivalence preserves the `star` operation. -/
  map_star' : ∀ a : A, toFun (star a) = star (toFun a)
  /-- By definition, a ⋆-algebra equivalence commutes with the action of scalars. -/
  map_smul' : ∀ (r : R) (a : A), toFun (r • a) = r • toFun a
#align star_alg_equiv StarAlgEquiv

@[inherit_doc StarAlgEquiv] infixr:25 " ≃⋆ₐ " => StarAlgEquiv _

@[inherit_doc] notation:25 A " ≃⋆ₐ[" R "] " B => StarAlgEquiv R A B

/-- Reinterpret a star algebra equivalence as a `RingEquiv` by forgetting the interaction with
the star operation and scalar multiplication. -/
add_decl_doc StarAlgEquiv.toRingEquiv

/-- `StarAlgEquivClass F R A B` asserts `F` is a type of bundled ⋆-algebra equivalences between
`A` and `B`.

You should also extend this typeclass when you extend `StarAlgEquiv`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/StarAlgHom/Variant6fa0420a95cd3939ca03cda7aa6e80b7fb9300c427b7b897dc637293b26f00fe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/StarAlgHom/Variant6fa0420a95cd3939ca03cda7aa6e80b7fb9300c427b7b897dc637293b26f00fe.lean#L684).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c6eae49228a1c930a65c798ba53ae85dea04e7a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
