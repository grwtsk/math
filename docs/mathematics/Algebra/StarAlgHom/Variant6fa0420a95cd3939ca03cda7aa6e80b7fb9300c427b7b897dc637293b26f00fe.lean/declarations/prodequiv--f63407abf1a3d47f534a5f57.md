## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f85292fda47888ea83c796d863276867841ea4c5535e2a2fb71474ddbcbf7377`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 666–683.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def prodEquiv : (A →⋆ₐ[R] B) × (A →⋆ₐ[R] C) ≃ (A →⋆ₐ[R] B × C)
    where
  toFun f := f.1.prod f.2
  invFun f := ((fst _ _ _).comp f, (snd _ _ _).comp f)
  left_inv f := by ext <;> rfl
  right_inv f := by ext <;> rfl
#align star_alg_hom.prod_equiv StarAlgHom.prodEquiv

end StarAlgHom

/-! ### Star algebra equivalences -/

-- Porting note: changed order of arguments to work around
-- [https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/2505]
/-- A *⋆-algebra* equivalence is an equivalence preserving addition, multiplication, scalar
multiplication and the star operation, which allows for considering both unital and non-unital
equivalences with a single structure. Currently, `AlgEquiv` requires unital algebras, which is
why this structure does not extend it. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/StarAlgHom/Variant6fa0420a95cd3939ca03cda7aa6e80b7fb9300c427b7b897dc637293b26f00fe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/StarAlgHom/Variant6fa0420a95cd3939ca03cda7aa6e80b7fb9300c427b7b897dc637293b26f00fe.lean#L666).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c6eae49228a1c930a65c798ba53ae85dea04e7a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
