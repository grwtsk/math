## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cd0663bf896f50c62b5db6599d5ee551e31c627ede7a501d107ea402535a4370`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected abbrev addGroupWithOne {S} [Zero S] [One S] [Add S] [SMul ℕ S] [Neg S] [Sub S]
    [SMul ℤ S] [NatCast S] [IntCast S] [AddGroupWithOne R] (f : S → R) (hf : Injective f)
    (zero : f 0 = 0) (one : f 1 = 1) (add : ∀ x y, f (x + y) = f x + f y) (neg : ∀ x, f (-x) = -f x)
    (sub : ∀ x y, f (x - y) = f x - f y) (nsmul : ∀ (n : ℕ) (x), f (n • x) = n • f x)
    (zsmul : ∀ (n : ℤ) (x), f (n • x) = n • f x) (natCast : ∀ n : ℕ, f n = n)
    (intCast : ∀ n : ℤ, f n = n) : AddGroupWithOne S :=
  { hf.addGroup f zero add neg sub (swap nsmul) (swap zsmul),
    hf.addMonoidWithOne f zero one add nsmul natCast with
    intCast := Int.cast,
    intCast_ofNat := fun n => hf (by rw [natCast, intCast, Int.cast_natCast]),
    intCast_negSucc := fun n => hf (by rw [intCast, neg, natCast, Int.cast_negSucc]) }

/-- A type endowed with `0`, `1` and `+` is an additive commutative group with one, if it admits an
injective map that preserves `0`, `1` and `+` to an additive commutative group with one.
See note [reducible non-instances]. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/InjSurj/Variant674bd36a406c3bbc86a87f3fbb38ab2e8d6c64587ecb188fd2758100dd1a2e4e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/InjSurj/Variant674bd36a406c3bbc86a87f3fbb38ab2e8d6c64587ecb188fd2758100dd1a2e4e.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0b5eaf7e8a20ff37c455008a8a941ef47840f5e2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
