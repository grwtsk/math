## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3fe8df7d1317aca9418bdd51485cc7060b0192f555ffb6a198b741a58e06cb46`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 320–330.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected abbrev addMonoidWithOne [AddMonoidWithOne R] (zero : f 0 = 0) (one : f 1 = 1)
    (add : ∀ x y, f (x + y) = f x + f y) (nsmul : ∀ (n : ℕ) (x), f (n • x) = n • f x)
    (natCast : ∀ n : ℕ, f n = n) : AddMonoidWithOne S :=
  { hf.addMonoid f zero add (swap nsmul) with
    natCast := Nat.cast,
    natCast_zero := by rw [← natCast, Nat.cast_zero, zero]
    natCast_succ := fun n => by rw [← natCast, Nat.cast_succ, add, one, natCast] }

/-- A type endowed with `0`, `1` and `+` is an additive monoid with one,
if it admits a surjective map that preserves `0`, `1` and `*` from an additive monoid with one.
See note [reducible non-instances]. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/InjSurj/Variantda72762a45e90ef1bc67b2a4da6a24d1f279f309b66584fe63c3fc49d8e82a6b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/InjSurj/Variantda72762a45e90ef1bc67b2a4da6a24d1f279f309b66584fe63c3fc49d8e82a6b.lean#L320).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `560da9c3b7abcf55ff42c2337f8bb163f35f7f68` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
