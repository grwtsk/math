## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:481b7cfc-1dc7-e644-449d-adf4718aa75b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma normalClosure_le_iSup_adjoin :
    normalClosure F K L ≤ ⨆ x : K, IntermediateField.adjoin F ((minpoly F x).rootSet L) :=
  iSup_le fun f _ ⟨x, hx⟩ ↦ le_iSup (α := IntermediateField F L) _ x <|
    IntermediateField.subset_adjoin F _ <| by
      rw [mem_rootSet_of_ne (minpoly.ne_zero (Algebra.IsIntegral.isIntegral x)), ← hx,
        AlgHom.toRingHom_eq_coe, AlgHom.coe_toRingHom, aeval_algHom_apply, minpoly.aeval, map_zero]

variable (splits : ∀ x : K, (minpoly F x).Splits (algebraMap F L))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Closure/Variant0dcfd45998aaf3453776d5feb07ff7ff5651a783ee0b266a2adce5bdbc41dff2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Closure/Variant0dcfd45998aaf3453776d5feb07ff7ff5651a783ee0b266a2adce5bdbc41dff2.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a8c9add38b9573e5ca038f524bd6e9424a464ba2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
