## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d8f84789-1b43-71ee-99d2-42b6a31af8e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 153–160.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem nonempty_algEquiv_iff_of_invertible_two [Invertible (2 : R)] :
    Nonempty (QuadraticAlgebra R a b ≃ₐ[R] QuadraticAlgebra R a' b') ↔
      ∃ u : Rˣ, discr a b = (u : R) ^ 2 * discr a' b' := by
  rw [nonempty_algEquiv_iff (isUnit_of_invertible (2 : R)).isRegular]
  simp [(isUnit_of_invertible (2 : R)).dvd]

/-- Over `ℤ` the discriminant is a complete invariant of quadratic algebras up to
isomorphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Discriminant/Variant99ef406f4a793e091149192fc403c9cd5d5dcdb59b070885a85e0d1bf19731fe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Discriminant/Variant99ef406f4a793e091149192fc403c9cd5d5dcdb59b070885a85e0d1bf19731fe.lean#L153).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f94de84008804b2f718166291f9c3a04b62d1011` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
