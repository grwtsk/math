## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c7735cb385e8b617ed1951f0f221ecef2c8bb9af49c2e37ab74771fb06ecd3be`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 99–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance hasCoeffs : D.P.HasCoeffs (D.subalgebra R) where
  coeffs_subset_range := by
    #adaptation_note /-- Before https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/13166
    (replacing grind's canonicalizer with a type-directed normalizer), `grind` closed this goal
    without the `rw`. It is not yet clear whether this is due to defeq abuse in Mathlib or a
    problem in the new canonicalizer; a minimization would help. The original proof was:
    `grind [subalgebra, Subalgebra.setRange_algebraMap, Algebra.subset_adjoin]` -/
    rw [Subalgebra.setRange_algebraMap]
    grind [subalgebra, Algebra.subset_adjoin]

set_option quotPrecheck false in
local notation "f₀" =>
  Ideal.Quotient.mkₐ (D.subalgebra R)
    (Ideal.span <| .range <| D.P.relationOfHasCoeffs (D.subalgebra R))

set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/NoetherianDescent/Variantadb740c2a8de4d5284e0c523d18a5e78a29bcea8442f974998e0e5d8f4c5dec9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/NoetherianDescent/Variantadb740c2a8de4d5284e0c523d18a5e78a29bcea8442f974998e0e5d8f4c5dec9.lean#L99).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f6ff5fc455611e01e0150760ab9d6660ffe0600f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
