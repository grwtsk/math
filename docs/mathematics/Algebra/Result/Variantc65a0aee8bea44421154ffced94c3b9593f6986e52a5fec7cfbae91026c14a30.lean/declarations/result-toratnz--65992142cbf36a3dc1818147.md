## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5f5de4fc3b0ac62259728771789b9a42108b9f66a88bd86373741c2f18480b8c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 332–341.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Result.toRatNZ {α : Q(Type u)} {e : Q($α)} : Result e → Option (Rat × Option Expr)
  | .isBool .. => none
  | .isNat _ lit _ => some (lit.natLit!, none)
  | .isNegNat _ lit _ => some (-lit.natLit!, none)
  | .isRat _ q _ _ p => some (q, q(IsRat.den_nz $p))

/--
Extract from a `Result` the integer value (as both a term and an expression),
and the proof that the original expression is equal to this integer.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Result/Variantc65a0aee8bea44421154ffced94c3b9593f6986e52a5fec7cfbae91026c14a30.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Result/Variantc65a0aee8bea44421154ffced94c3b9593f6986e52a5fec7cfbae91026c14a30.lean#L332).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `94f7db976f56cb5607ea8cb1a42e5f0cb7fc46ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
