## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b9ea4e0a68da5523c3fac7ba84898bb3157ecf98daec82fbe29e421a11aaf522`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 413–421.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Result.toRat {α : Q(Type u)} {e : Q($α)} : Result e → Option Rat
  | .isBool .. => none
  | .isNat _ lit _ => some lit.natLit!
  | .isNegNat _ lit _ => some (-lit.natLit!)
  | .isNNRat _ q .. => some q
  | .isNegNNRat _ q .. => some q

/-- Returns the rational number that is the result of `norm_num` evaluation, along with a proof
that the denominator is nonzero in the `isRat` case. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Result/Variant6db6a2db2b67ba833f006cfa20fcb727089a4bae5c83ca23b3a11e5de20610ef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Result/Variant6db6a2db2b67ba833f006cfa20fcb727089a4bae5c83ca23b3a11e5de20610ef.lean#L413).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0f6b328574094be8ac34357633d5aaec21a6727d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
