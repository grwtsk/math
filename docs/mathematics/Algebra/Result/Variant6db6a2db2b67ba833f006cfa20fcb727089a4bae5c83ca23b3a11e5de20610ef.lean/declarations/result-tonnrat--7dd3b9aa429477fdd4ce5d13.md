## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ef609ef79cfc7dbd566d720aa1cbb3c03ed733c5556b400ebdd70271aa190f70`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 445–457.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Result.toNNRat' {α : Q(Type u)} {e : Q($α)}
    (_i : Q(DivisionSemiring $α) := by with_reducible assumption) :
    Result e → Option (Rat × (n : Q(ℕ)) × (d : Q(ℕ)) × Q(IsNNRat $e $n $d))
  | .isNat _ lit proof =>
    have proof : Q(@IsNat _ instAddMonoidWithOne' $e $lit) := proof
    some ⟨lit.natLit!, q($lit), q(nat_lit 1), q(($proof).to_isNNRat)⟩
  | .isNNRat _ q n d proof => some ⟨q, n, d, proof⟩
  | _ => none

/--
Extract from a `Result` the rational value (as both a term and an expression),
and the proof that the original expression is equal to this rational number.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Result/Variant6db6a2db2b67ba833f006cfa20fcb727089a4bae5c83ca23b3a11e5de20610ef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Result/Variant6db6a2db2b67ba833f006cfa20fcb727089a4bae5c83ca23b3a11e5de20610ef.lean#L445).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0f6b328574094be8ac34357633d5aaec21a6727d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
