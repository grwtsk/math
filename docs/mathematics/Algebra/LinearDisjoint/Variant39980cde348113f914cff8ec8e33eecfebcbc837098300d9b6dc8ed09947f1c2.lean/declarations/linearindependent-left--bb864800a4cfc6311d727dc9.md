## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:22703445-3cda-3e77-5549-342a03660d2a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 239–246.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem linearIndependent_left (H : A.LinearDisjoint L)
    {ι : Type*} {a : ι → A} (ha : LinearIndependent F a) : LinearIndependent L (A.val ∘ a) :=
  (Subalgebra.LinearDisjoint.linearIndependent_left_of_flat H ha).map_of_injective_injective
    (AlgEquiv.ofInjectiveField (IsScalarTower.toAlgHom F L E)) (AddMonoidHom.id E)
    (by simp) (by simp) (fun _ _ ↦ by simp_rw [Algebra.smul_def]; rfl)

/-- If there exists an `F`-basis of `A` which remains linearly independent over `L`, then
`A` and `L` are linearly disjoint. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/LinearDisjoint/Variant39980cde348113f914cff8ec8e33eecfebcbc837098300d9b6dc8ed09947f1c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/LinearDisjoint/Variant39980cde348113f914cff8ec8e33eecfebcbc837098300d9b6dc8ed09947f1c2.lean#L239).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `920e0027760d6d79581119139254f9c6a08848d2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
