## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d23ac5dc0742cb6a7b59cb1bb9cb5360a5f87b3014eb0c705b1e2d802be29fa2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 512–525.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected abbrev field [Field β] : Field α := by
  let add_group_with_one := e.addGroupWithOne
  let neg := e.Neg
  let inv := e.Inv
  let div := e.div
  let mul := e.mul
  let npow := e.pow ℕ
  let zpow := e.pow ℤ
  let nnratCast := e.nnratCast
  let ratCast := e.ratCast
  let nnqsmul := e.smul ℚ≥0
  let qsmul := e.smul ℚ
  apply e.injective.field _ <;> intros <;> exact e.apply_symm_apply _

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/TransferInstance/Variant23bf0c782f9aa17226237ed1dd2a425c21d5b9d03d233885990803e4892f1f39.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/TransferInstance/Variant23bf0c782f9aa17226237ed1dd2a425c21d5b9d03d233885990803e4892f1f39.lean#L512).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cee8ee048be766898c8a5093ebf90a0e3a5e99ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
