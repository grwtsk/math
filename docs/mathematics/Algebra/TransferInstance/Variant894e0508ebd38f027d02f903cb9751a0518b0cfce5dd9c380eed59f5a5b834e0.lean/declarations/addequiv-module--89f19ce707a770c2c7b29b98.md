## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0e3723d6a9a364921e567c30a75f01832e9b29fe4a41d0a72874121deffb5df9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 693–704.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev AddEquiv.module (e : α ≃+ β) :
    Module A α where
  toSMul := e.toEquiv.smul A
  one_smul := by simp [Equiv.smul_def]
  mul_smul := by simp [Equiv.smul_def, mul_smul]
  smul_zero := by simp [Equiv.smul_def]
  smul_add := by simp [Equiv.smul_def]
  add_smul := by simp [Equiv.smul_def, add_smul]
  zero_smul := by simp [Equiv.smul_def]

/-- The module instance from `AddEquiv.module` is compatible with the `R`-module structures,
if the `AddEquiv` is induced by an `R`-module isomorphism. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/TransferInstance/Variant894e0508ebd38f027d02f903cb9751a0518b0cfce5dd9c380eed59f5a5b834e0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/TransferInstance/Variant894e0508ebd38f027d02f903cb9751a0518b0cfce5dd9c380eed59f5a5b834e0.lean#L693).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f1ea70614d8266216a7e85e83750321db238fb4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
