## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:84a17a23fdf1177515bcd24ce3cf326a8ae2a7b808c3439f647a46c7c90af5f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 578–592.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def linearEquiv (e : α ≃ β) [AddCommMonoid β] [Module R β] : by
    let addCommMonoid := Equiv.addCommMonoid e
    let module := Equiv.module R e
    exact α ≃ₗ[R] β := by
  intros
  exact
    { Equiv.addEquiv e with
      map_smul' := fun r x => by
        apply e.symm.injective
        simp only [toFun_as_coe, RingHom.id_apply, EmbeddingLike.apply_eq_iff_eq]
        exact Iff.mpr (apply_eq_iff_eq_symm_apply _) rfl }

variable (α) in
/-- Shrink `α` to a smaller universe preserves module structure. -/
@[simps!]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/TransferInstance/Variant894e0508ebd38f027d02f903cb9751a0518b0cfce5dd9c380eed59f5a5b834e0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/TransferInstance/Variant894e0508ebd38f027d02f903cb9751a0518b0cfce5dd9c380eed59f5a5b834e0.lean#L578).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f1ea70614d8266216a7e85e83750321db238fb4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
