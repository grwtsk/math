## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:90078f27c6e0a0abad4174437fbcfa7f97a98534861c6b04e018a5f9436bcf84`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 264–269.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Step.scalar_tower (n) : IsScalarTower k (Step k n) (Step k (n + 1)) :=
  IsScalarTower.of_algebraMap_eq fun z =>
    @Nat.leRecOn_succ (Step k) 0 n n.zero_le (n + 1).zero_le (@fun n => toStepSucc k n) z
#align algebraic_closure.step.scalar_tower AlgebraicClosure.Step.scalar_tower

--Porting Note: Added to make `Step.isIntegral` faster
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/AlgebraicClosure/Variantb50c24e5815678e06e9be62e0f289b550ee56ffb697ccb8cf031c6747e60d610.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/AlgebraicClosure/Variantb50c24e5815678e06e9be62e0f289b550ee56ffb697ccb8cf031c6747e60d610.lean#L264).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cc7b96bb8d7b6be77ae4e9e5d9d82af70e1e6736` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
