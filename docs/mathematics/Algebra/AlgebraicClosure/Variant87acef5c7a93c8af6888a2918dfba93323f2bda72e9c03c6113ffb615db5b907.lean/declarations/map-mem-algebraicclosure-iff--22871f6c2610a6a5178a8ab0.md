## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4593f2cc-bd67-d613-a354-a92e3ea0e94c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 67–74.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_mem_algebraicClosure_iff (i : E →ₐ[F] K) {x : E} :
    i x ∈ algebraicClosure F K ↔ x ∈ algebraicClosure F E := by
  simp_rw [mem_algebraicClosure_iff', ← minpoly.ne_zero_iff, minpoly.algHom_eq i i.injective]

namespace algebraicClosure

/-- If `i` is an `F`-algebra homomorphism from `E` to `K`, then the preimage of
`algebraicClosure F K` under the map `i` is equal to `algebraicClosure F E`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/AlgebraicClosure/Variant87acef5c7a93c8af6888a2918dfba93323f2bda72e9c03c6113ffb615db5b907.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/AlgebraicClosure/Variant87acef5c7a93c8af6888a2918dfba93323f2bda72e9c03c6113ffb615db5b907.lean#L67).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bd401aa570b7d998350c5dfb28c129ce78e7ec96` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
