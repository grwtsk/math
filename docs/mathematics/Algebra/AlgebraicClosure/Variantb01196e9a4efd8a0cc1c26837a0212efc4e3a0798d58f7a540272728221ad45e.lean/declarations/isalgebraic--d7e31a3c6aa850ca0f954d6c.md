## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2793242447f0ff88532d0ba0eaab0ef311469619b78c0f052893aa81d39bf2c0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 187–206.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance isAlgebraic : Algebra.IsAlgebraic k (AlgebraicClosure k) :=
  ⟨fun z =>
    IsIntegral.isAlgebraic <| by
      let ⟨p, hp⟩ := Ideal.Quotient.mk_surjective z
      rw [← hp]
      induction p using MvPolynomial.induction_on generalizing z with
        | C => exact isIntegral_algebraMap
        | add _ _ ha hb => exact (ha _ rfl).add (hb _ rfl)
        | mul_X p fi ih =>
          rw [map_mul]
          refine (ih _ rfl).mul ⟨_, fi.1.2, ?_⟩
          simp_rw [← eval_map, Monics.map_eq_prod, eval_prod, Polynomial.map_sub, eval_sub]
          apply Finset.prod_eq_zero (Finset.mem_univ fi.2)
          rw [map_C]
          -- The `erw` is needed here because the `R` in `eval` is `AlgebraicClosure k`,
          -- but this has been unfolded in the arguments of `eval`.
          erw [eval_C]
          simp⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/AlgebraicClosure/Variantb01196e9a4efd8a0cc1c26837a0212efc4e3a0798d58f7a540272728221ad45e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/AlgebraicClosure/Variantb01196e9a4efd8a0cc1c26837a0212efc4e3a0798d58f7a540272728221ad45e.lean#L187).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `15fa2c7599026f625a9ecf007aadc2eaa3498135` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
