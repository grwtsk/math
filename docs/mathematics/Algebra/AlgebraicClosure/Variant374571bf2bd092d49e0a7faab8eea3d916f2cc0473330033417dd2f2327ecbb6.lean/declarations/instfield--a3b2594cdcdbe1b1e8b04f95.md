## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6df2d1959436d7f9cf358f9348149ab868397e6bb704a3bbd2a2b21b0e11d172`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 153–168.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instField : Field (AlgebraicClosure k) where
  __ := instCommRing _
  __ := instGroupWithZero _
  nnqsmul := (· • ·)
  qsmul := (· • ·)
  nnratCast q := algebraMap k _ q
  ratCast q := algebraMap k _ q
  nnratCast_def q := by change algebraMap k _ _ = _; simp_rw [NNRat.cast_def, map_div₀, map_natCast]
  ratCast_def q := by
    change algebraMap k _ _ = _; rw [Rat.cast_def, map_div₀, map_intCast, map_natCast]
  nnqsmul_def q x := Quotient.inductionOn x fun p ↦ congr_arg Quotient.mk'' <| by
    ext; simp [MvPolynomial.algebraMap_eq, NNRat.smul_def]
  qsmul_def q x := Quotient.inductionOn x fun p ↦ congr_arg Quotient.mk'' <| by
    ext; simp [MvPolynomial.algebraMap_eq, Rat.smul_def]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/AlgebraicClosure/Variant374571bf2bd092d49e0a7faab8eea3d916f2cc0473330033417dd2f2327ecbb6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/AlgebraicClosure/Variant374571bf2bd092d49e0a7faab8eea3d916f2cc0473330033417dd2f2327ecbb6.lean#L153).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9a7fffe7dd90004b7ec42783aef97285f931af13` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
