## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f36ae0c3-a3c0-19e8-56d8-119a20ae989a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 194–199.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_top_iff : algebraicClosure F E = ⊤ ↔ Algebra.IsAlgebraic F E :=
  ⟨fun h ↦ ⟨fun _ ↦ mem_algebraicClosure_iff.1 (h ▸ mem_top)⟩,
    fun _ ↦ top_unique fun x _ ↦ mem_algebraicClosure_iff.2 (Algebra.IsAlgebraic.isAlgebraic x)⟩

/-- If `K / E / F` is a field extension tower, then `algebraicClosure F K` is contained in
`algebraicClosure E K`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/AlgebraicClosure/Varianta64bc74911271986c1a0009618b7bd17c0c399e980221e437f1a810bde0b8863.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/AlgebraicClosure/Varianta64bc74911271986c1a0009618b7bd17c0c399e980221e437f1a810bde0b8863.lean#L194).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `794f32f75e23ef4526a2b5da7239e57a88283659` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
