## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:680a4fa1-841c-9aea-2f8d-4e34c1925bdb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 398–402.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem comap_bot_le_of_injective (hf : Function.Injective f) : comap f ⊥ ≤ I := by
  refine le_trans (fun x hx => ?_) bot_le
  rw [mem_comap, Submodule.mem_bot, ← map_zero f] at hx
  exact Eq.symm (hf hx) ▸ Submodule.zero_mem ⊥

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/Maps/Variant1a9bed5409f1eb9c610eb05afccc23778b31ea46c0f0d0ca8d37bf1e338de002.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/Maps/Variant1a9bed5409f1eb9c610eb05afccc23778b31ea46c0f0d0ca8d37bf1e338de002.lean#L398).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `78b13e000b0f7a434acd12f304133cec8247015a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
