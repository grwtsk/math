## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9050f576-27d0-ba30-d546-06a07d51fcb3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 167–177.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem LinearMap.rTensor_range :
    range (rTensor Q g) =
      range (rTensor Q (Submodule.subtype (range g))) := by
  have : g = (Submodule.subtype _).comp g.rangeRestrict := rfl
  nth_rewrite 1 [this]
  rw [rTensor_comp]
  apply range_comp_of_range_eq_top
  rw [range_eq_top]
  apply rTensor_surjective
  rw [← range_eq_top, range_rangeRestrict]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Algebra/RightExactness/Variant53f7844a2c726a21385b358df8c1cec3f628266f5b190b6d4e7e65a0cb870629.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Algebra/RightExactness/Variant53f7844a2c726a21385b358df8c1cec3f628266f5b190b6d4e7e65a0cb870629.lean#L167).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b1dc5533a78a54da60f8f336052f02e6c1a67f6a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
