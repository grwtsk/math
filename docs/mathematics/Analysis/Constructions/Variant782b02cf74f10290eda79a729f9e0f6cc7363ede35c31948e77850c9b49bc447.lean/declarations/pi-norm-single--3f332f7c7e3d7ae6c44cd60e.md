## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2dacb14a-eea7-3004-0ee5-d9ada125850c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 417–434.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ‖Pi.single i y‖ = ‖y‖ :=
  congr_arg Subtype.val <| Pi.nnnorm_single y

end Pi

/-! ### Multiplicative opposite -/

namespace MulOpposite

/-- The (additive) norm on the multiplicative opposite is the same as the norm on the original type.

Note that we do not provide this more generally as `Norm Eᵐᵒᵖ`, as this is not always a good
choice of norm in the multiplicative `SeminormedGroup E` case.

We could repeat this instance to provide a `[SeminormedGroup E] : SeminormedGroup Eᵃᵒᵖ` instance,
but that case would likely never be used.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Constructions/Variant782b02cf74f10290eda79a729f9e0f6cc7363ede35c31948e77850c9b49bc447.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Constructions/Variant782b02cf74f10290eda79a729f9e0f6cc7363ede35c31948e77850c9b49bc447.lean#L417).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1cce627d40eb4cbdb8d6d7cce9fb9c3488d8c4c8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
