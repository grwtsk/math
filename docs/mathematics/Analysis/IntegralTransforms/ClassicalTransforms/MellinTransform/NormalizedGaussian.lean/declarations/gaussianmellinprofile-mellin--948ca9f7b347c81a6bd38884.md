## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a0298d2b-2f1e-964c-ec0a-06f72bfe13eb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 73–85.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem gaussianMellinProfile_mellin (s : ℂ) :
    mellin gaussianMellinProfile s = Complex.exp (s ^ 2) := by
  have heq : mellin gaussianMellinProfile s =
      mellin (fun x => gaussianMellinCoefficient • logarithmicGaussianWith (1/4 : ℂ) x) s := by
    apply setIntegral_congr_fun measurableSet_Ioi
    intro x hx
    dsimp only
    rw [gaussianMellinProfile_eq_quarter hx]
  rw [heq, mellin_const_smul, logarithmicGaussianWith_mellin (by norm_num)]
  change gaussianMellinCoefficient * (_ * Complex.exp _) = _
  rw [← mul_assoc, gaussianMellinCoefficient_normalizes]
  norm_num

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/IntegralTransforms/ClassicalTransforms/MellinTransform/NormalizedGaussian.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MellinTransform/NormalizedGaussian.lean#L73).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a27d43838697c660b546d91d38e35a1bbfa23e5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
