## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a3d64de5-8207-7ffe-eaa5-fa8d68ae770b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 40–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rectangleDivisor_apply
    {f : ℂ → ℂ} {z w s : ℂ}
    (hf : MeromorphicOn f (closedRectangle z w))
    (hs : s ∈ closedRectangle z w) :
    rectangleDivisor f z w s = (meromorphicOrderAt f s).untop₀ := by
  exact MeromorphicOn.divisor_apply hf hs

/-- A compact rectangle meets the zero/pole divisor in only finitely many
points. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeromorphicOrder/Variant696da0b7d03a3406e219c44e26e6c1ab9295f5b467e0f06180066724757fc1d8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeromorphicOrder/Variant696da0b7d03a3406e219c44e26e6c1ab9295f5b467e0f06180066724757fc1d8.lean#L40).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
