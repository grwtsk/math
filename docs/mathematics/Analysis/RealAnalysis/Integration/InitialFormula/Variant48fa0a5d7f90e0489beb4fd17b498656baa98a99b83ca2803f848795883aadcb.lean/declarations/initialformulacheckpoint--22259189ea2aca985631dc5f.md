## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0b8e3a5dec16b09b9f61a4005a48958b0dadc163f44128131368e9355e2de8bf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 647–662.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def InitialFormulaCheckpoint : Prop :=
  ∀ s : ℂ, 1 < s.re →
    IntegrableOn
      (fun A : ℝ ↦
        Complex.exp (-s * A) *
          (weightedSource A : ℂ))
      (Ioi 1) ∧
    Summable
      (fun o : ZeroOccurrence ↦
        equation20Summand (shiftedValue o) s) ∧
    (∫ A in Ioi (1 : ℝ),
      Complex.exp (-s * A) *
        (weightedSource A : ℂ)) =
      ∑' o : ZeroOccurrence,
        equation20Summand (shiftedValue o) s

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/InitialFormula/Variant48fa0a5d7f90e0489beb4fd17b498656baa98a99b83ca2803f848795883aadcb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/InitialFormula/Variant48fa0a5d7f90e0489beb4fd17b498656baa98a99b83ca2803f848795883aadcb.lean#L647).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2adacbe11875d3e1ac1e540fc1412ce79b82d47e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
