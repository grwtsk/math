## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0a1cf8fd4211990e66b5a6eed282a9724fd978238092486c1fc58ef5cae897fb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 410–415.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def occurrenceIntegrand
    (s : ℂ) (o : ZeroOccurrence) (A : ℝ) : ℂ :=
  Complex.exp (-s * A) *
    expandedSummand A (shiftedValue o)

/-- Exact sharp scale factor after applying the equation-(17) bound. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/InitialFormula/Variant2023f6d173b0300b92c6a7dd6a399fe66b9fa98382eebcf09a2da45921d74a4d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/InitialFormula/Variant2023f6d173b0300b92c6a7dd6a399fe66b9fa98382eebcf09a2da45921d74a4d.lean#L410).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `754ccac173094178192c7e051096f1ff06033325` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
