## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:709d2305-ee24-fa14-4e90-1b335ec30d95`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 205–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sampling_padded_endpoint_zero (A x : ℝ) (F : ℝ → ℝ) (hx : 0 < x)
    (hzero : ∀ t, 2 * A ≤ t → F t = 0)
    (u : ℝ) (hu : (⌊Real.exp (2 * A) / x⌋₊ + 1 : ℕ) ≤ u) :
    TwoMomentSampling.samplingIntegrand F x u = 0 := by
  have hN : (0 : ℝ) < (⌊Real.exp (2 * A) / x⌋₊ + 1 : ℕ) := by positivity
  apply sampling_zero A x u F hx (hN.trans_le hu) hzero
  have hfloor := Nat.lt_floor_add_one (Real.exp (2 * A) / x)
  have hd : Real.exp (2 * A) / x < u := by
    push_cast at hu
    exact hfloor.trans_le hu
  simpa only [mul_comm] using ((div_lt_iff₀ hx).mp hd).le

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/HomogeneityDefect/Variantfd859fb654fdf8ef0911c105e5fedc61fe5e9bfb0a4a988251a48d92617639f4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/HomogeneityDefect/Variantfd859fb654fdf8ef0911c105e5fedc61fe5e9bfb0a4a988251a48d92617639f4.lean#L205).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aae5930c09c365323c06ada6904c8975b6ea35f8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
