## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0b26dbf5-bb5a-6ff6-1c1d-8d9ad1ef5280`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 175–183.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem logMap_add (f g : PositiveL2) : logMap (f+g) = logMap f + logMap g := by
  apply Lp.ext
  filter_upwards [logMap_ae (f+g),logMap_ae f,logMap_ae g,
    Lp.coeFn_add (logMap f) (logMap g),exp_quasi.ae_eq_comp (Lp.coeFn_add f g)]

  dsimp only [Pi.add_apply,Function.comp_apply] at hadd hp
  rw [hfg,hadd,hf,hg,logFunc,logFunc,logFunc,hp]
  exact mul_add _ _ _

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LogCoordinateAttempt05/Variantf286c0baf16988bb6caad3f88de0720160047a7cccc6f3fd0af53234a7de7d2d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LogCoordinateAttempt05/Variantf286c0baf16988bb6caad3f88de0720160047a7cccc6f3fd0af53234a7de7d2d.lean#L175).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `72c3836d1e38ba0f9c8ae4b44cee2ff5c44e8b18` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
