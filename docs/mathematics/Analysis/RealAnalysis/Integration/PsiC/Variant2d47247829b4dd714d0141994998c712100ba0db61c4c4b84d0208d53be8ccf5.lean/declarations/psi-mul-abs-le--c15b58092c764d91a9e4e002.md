## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eaf7eb50-98c0-d5d9-d22c-cd1b751298f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–61.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem psi_mul_abs_le (_hc : 4 ≤ c) (_hw : 1 ≤ w) (_hwL : 2 * w ≤ L) (r : ℝ) :
    psiC c L w r * |r| ≤ 2 := by
  unfold psiC
  split_ifs with hr
  · simp [hr]
  · have hra : 0 < |r| := abs_pos.mpr hr
    rw [← le_div_iff₀ hra]
    exact (min_le_right _ _).trans (min_le_left _ _)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PsiC/Variant2d47247829b4dd714d0141994998c712100ba0db61c4c4b84d0208d53be8ccf5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PsiC/Variant2d47247829b4dd714d0141994998c712100ba0db61c4c4b84d0208d53be8ccf5.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8942815d10d4b5f6e37bba5fb2264ca25fc626f7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
