## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f216c92b-fbc7-b28d-d7e9-9f3af5618c41`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 570–581.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integral_sq_mul_sq_le_of_bounds {F : ℝ → ℝ} {C : ℝ}
    (hC : 0 ≤ C) (h1 : ∀ r, |F r| * |r| ≤ 2) (h2 : ∀ r, |F r| * r ^ 2 ≤ C) :
    ∫ r, F r ^ 2 * r ^ 2 ≤ 8 + 2 * C ^ 2 := by
  rw [← integral_momMaj C]
  exact integral_mono_of_nonneg (Eventually.of_forall fun r => by positivity)
    (momMaj_integrable C) (Eventually.of_forall fun r => sq_mul_sq_le_momMaj hC h1 h2 r)


end PsiC
end Zeta23

end
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PsiC/Variant2d47247829b4dd714d0141994998c712100ba0db61c4c4b84d0208d53be8ccf5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PsiC/Variant2d47247829b4dd714d0141994998c712100ba0db61c4c4b84d0208d53be8ccf5.lean#L570).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8942815d10d4b5f6e37bba5fb2264ca25fc626f7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
