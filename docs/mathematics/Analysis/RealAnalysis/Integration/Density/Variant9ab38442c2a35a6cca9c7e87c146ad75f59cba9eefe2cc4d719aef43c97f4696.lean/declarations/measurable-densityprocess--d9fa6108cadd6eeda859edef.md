## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:479e842f-5d2e-7461-3b88-924a9d215467`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 137–142.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma measurable_densityProcess (κ : Kernel α (γ × β)) (ν : Kernel α γ) (n : ℕ)
    {s : Set β} (hs : MeasurableSet s) :
    Measurable (fun (p : α × γ) ↦ densityProcess κ ν n p.1 p.2 s) :=
  (measurable_densityProcess_aux κ ν n hs).ennreal_toReal

-- The following two lemmas also work without the `( :)`, but they are slow.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Density/Variant9ab38442c2a35a6cca9c7e87c146ad75f59cba9eefe2cc4d719aef43c97f4696.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Density/Variant9ab38442c2a35a6cca9c7e87c146ad75f59cba9eefe2cc4d719aef43c97f4696.lean#L137).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8dced0157fdc3759f9e402ccc9bb10dec0a6e0a2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
