## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:17ce86c0-621b-bac6-0ec5-e32edf765924`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 331–347.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma postcompLM_apply [LinearMap.CompatibleSMul F F' ℝ 𝕜] (T : F →L[𝕜] F')
    (f : 𝓓^{n}_{K}(E, F)) :
    postcompLM T f = T ∘ f :=
  rfl

open scoped Classical in
/-- If `n₁ ≥ n₂` and `K₁ ⊆ K₂`, `monoLM 𝕜` is the `𝕜`-linear inclusion of
`𝓓^{n₁}_{K₁}(E, F)` inside `𝓓^{n₂}_{K₂}(E, F)`. Otherwise, this is the zero map.

This is in fact continuous (see `monoCLM`). Furthermore:
* it is a topological embedding when `n₁ = n₂` and `K₁ ⊆ K₂` (not in Mathlib as of March 2026).
* it maps bounded sets to compact sets when `n₁ ≥ n₂ + 1` and `K₁ ⊆ K₂` (not in Mathlib as of
March 2026).

The parameters `n₁, n₂, K₁, K₂` are implicit as they can often be inferred from context, or
specified by a type ascription.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ContDiffMapSupportedIn/Variant64362a54f13747963496e52c3e48d0f99f43c5d5124172993f73a5653c6f9ac0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ContDiffMapSupportedIn/Variant64362a54f13747963496e52c3e48d0f99f43c5d5124172993f73a5653c6f9ac0.lean#L331).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `61febe388136931eb71d1c284fc1506421af93d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
