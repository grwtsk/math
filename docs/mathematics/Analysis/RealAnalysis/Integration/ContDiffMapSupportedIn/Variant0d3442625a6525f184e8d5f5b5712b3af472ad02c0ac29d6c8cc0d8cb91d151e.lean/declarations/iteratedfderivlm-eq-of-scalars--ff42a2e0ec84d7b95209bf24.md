## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9e8a6cb0-6981-77f9-e22d-c85c8af72a31`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 481–496.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma iteratedFDerivLM_eq_of_scalars {i : ℕ} (𝕜' : Type*) [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜']
    [NormedSpace 𝕜' F] [SMulCommClass ℝ 𝕜' F] :
    (iteratedFDerivLM 𝕜 n k i : 𝓓^{n}_{K}(E, F) → _)
      = iteratedFDerivLM 𝕜' n k i :=
  rfl

variable (n) in
/-- `structureMapLM 𝕜 n i` is the `𝕜`-linear-map sending `f : 𝓓^{n}_{K}(E, F)` to its
`i`-th iterated derivative as an element of `E →ᵇ (E [×i]→L[ℝ] F)`. In other words, it
is the composition of `toBoundedContinuousFunctionLM 𝕜` and `iteratedFDerivLM 𝕜 n 0 i`.
This only makes mathematical sense if `i ≤ n`, otherwise we define it as the zero map.

We call these "structure maps" because they define the topology on `𝓓^{n}_{K}(E, F)`.

This is subsumed by `structureMapCLM`, which also bundles the
continuity. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ContDiffMapSupportedIn/Variant0d3442625a6525f184e8d5f5b5712b3af472ad02c0ac29d6c8cc0d8cb91d151e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ContDiffMapSupportedIn/Variant0d3442625a6525f184e8d5f5b5712b3af472ad02c0ac29d6c8cc0d8cb91d151e.lean#L481).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e40ab3ba02ca5ed3d5a262fe8ddf049c8c28b72e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
