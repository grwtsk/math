## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:82ee5b33-628f-bf47-a609-9d26e24e0576`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 86–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem unit_transform_zero :
    (∫ x : ℝ in (-1)..1, (1-(x:ℂ)^2)^4 * Complex.exp (0*x)) = (256/315:ℂ) := by
  simp only [zero_mul, Complex.exp_zero, mul_one]
  have hc : (fun x : ℝ ↦ (1-(x:ℂ)^2)^4) = (fun x : ℝ ↦ (((1-x^2)^4:ℝ):ℂ)) := by
    funext x
    norm_cast
  rw [hc, intervalIntegral.integral_ofReal, unit_mass]
  norm_num

#print axioms unit_transform
#print axioms unit_transform_zero
end TransformProbe
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/TransformProbe/Variant2446e02339129a7fe9e3b100a9e67db038b4cc349240b1250da26808299d2c7f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/TransformProbe/Variant2446e02339129a7fe9e3b100a9e67db038b4cc349240b1250da26808299d2c7f.lean#L86).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b66316eb5f48ca19a33a47bc8b2895bf311b9e15` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
