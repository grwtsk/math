## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:998ba2b7-97a1-0bd3-76bf-e78095f46d2b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 26–33.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem inverse_square_integrable {T : ℝ} (hT : 0 < T) :
    IntegrableOn (fun t : ℝ => 1/t^2) (Ioi T) := by
  have h := integrableOn_Ioi_rpow_of_lt (a:=(-2:ℝ)) (by norm_num) hT
  convert! h using 1
  funext t
  rw [Real.rpow_neg_ofNat]
  simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ActualArithmeticDecayAttempt05/Variant161c7c1ab3983eb8d299be18dbf6c6ba8d05f48f03faca1d25aa094535f6e8aa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ActualArithmeticDecayAttempt05/Variant161c7c1ab3983eb8d299be18dbf6c6ba8d05f48f03faca1d25aa094535f6e8aa.lean#L26).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9599121b7644712679f75f207afb5a6cfc5fd3ae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
