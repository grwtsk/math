## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3b2bc5c9-318c-246b-61fb-7256f450e7e6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 254–260.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_integral (f : α →ₛ E) (g : E → F) (hf : Integrable f μ) (hg : g 0 = 0) :
    (f.map g).integral μ = ∑ x ∈ f.range, (μ.real (f ⁻¹' {x})) • g x :=
  map_setToSimpleFunc _ weightedSMul_union hf hg

/-- `SimpleFunc.integral` and `SimpleFunc.lintegral` agree when the integrand has type
    `α →ₛ ℝ≥0∞`. But since `ℝ≥0∞` is not a `NormedSpace`, we need some form of coercion.
    See `integral_eq_lintegral` for a simpler version. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/L1/Variant99f1eadd0e057e71c231b1745d7a1daf8528f3b43b6c08b3758f3b22cdbe7acb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/L1/Variant99f1eadd0e057e71c231b1745d7a1daf8528f3b43b6c08b3758f3b22cdbe7acb.lean#L254).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5920ecca9951406866696dcf79bf2219d0bb186f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
