## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cc5223e7-3f8c-119c-8c22-c5b3d655f21c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 421–427.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem aestronglyMeasurable_comp_snd_map_prodMk_iff {Ω F} {_ : MeasurableSpace Ω}
    [TopologicalSpace F] {X : Ω → β} {μ : Measure Ω} (hX : Measurable X) {f : Ω → F} :
    AEStronglyMeasurable (fun x : β × Ω => f x.2) (μ.map fun ω => (X ω, ω)) ↔
      AEStronglyMeasurable f μ :=
  ⟨fun h => h.comp_measurable (hX.prodMk measurable_id),
    fun h => h.comp_snd_map_prodMk hX.aemeasurable⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CondDistrib/Variant9daef0b8b438d266f7ec3f3ad2519f8e176f04f5a79030718e9dcb4b29543a99.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CondDistrib/Variant9daef0b8b438d266f7ec3f3ad2519f8e176f04f5a79030718e9dcb4b29543a99.lean#L421).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c02ff0221be7910d34055afd1a9eae731bbc6905` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
