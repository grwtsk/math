## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:117ad599-a727-4bb0-2676-03ffc2399452`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 214–221.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem setLIntegral_condDistrib_of_measurableSet (hX : Measurable X) (hY : AEMeasurable Y μ)
    (hs : MeasurableSet s) {t : Set α} (ht : MeasurableSet[mβ.comap X] t) :
    ∫⁻ a in t, condDistrib Y X μ (X a) s ∂μ = μ (t ∩ Y ⁻¹' s) := by
  obtain ⟨t', ht', rfl⟩ := ht
  rw [setLIntegral_preimage_condDistrib hX hY hs ht']

/-- For almost every `a : α`, the `condDistrib Y X μ` kernel applied to `X a` and a measurable set
`s` is equal to the conditional expectation of the indicator of `Y ⁻¹' s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CondDistrib/Variant8c26bd155239e752a5584d542806209b8bc785a874a61d00b1e9dca75b325caf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CondDistrib/Variant8c26bd155239e752a5584d542806209b8bc785a874a61d00b1e9dca75b325caf.lean#L214).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a664e4cf9b584979ed5a9fccfc68508a3faa2ec` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
