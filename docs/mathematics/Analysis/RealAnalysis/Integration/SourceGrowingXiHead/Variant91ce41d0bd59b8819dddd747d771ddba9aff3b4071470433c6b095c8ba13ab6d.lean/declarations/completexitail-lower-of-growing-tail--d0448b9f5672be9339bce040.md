## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:201bb717-2f84-c05f-c9a4-d59ff5b94232`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 210–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem completeXiTail_lower_of_growing_tail {Q A K : ℝ} (hQ : 91 ≤ Q) (hQA : Q ≤ A)
    (hTail : -K ≤ growingXiTail A) :
    -(K + growingXiHeadCost Q) ≤ completeXiTail A := by
  have hhead := neg_le_of_abs_le (growingXiHead_abs_le_at_radius hQ hQA)
  rw [completeXiTail_eq_growing_head_add_tail (by linarith : 91 ≤ A)]
  linarith

end RH16GrowingXiHead
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceGrowingXiHead/Variant91ce41d0bd59b8819dddd747d771ddba9aff3b4071470433c6b095c8ba13ab6d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceGrowingXiHead/Variant91ce41d0bd59b8819dddd747d771ddba9aff3b4071470433c6b095c8ba13ab6d.lean#L210).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `277dea7a973c39f51b99d3c12a37fdf55ffb9353` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
