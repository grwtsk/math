## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:81a71ddc-26a5-d4c3-0586-8af8c3dd4665`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 323–334.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem abs_phiHatR_mul_sq_le (hϱ : TaperProfile ϱ) (hw : 1 ≤ w) (hwL : 2 * w ≤ L) (r : ℝ) :
    |phiHatR ϱ L w r| * r ^ 2 ≤ cRho ϱ / w := by
  have hw0 : 0 < w := by linarith
  have h := norm_phiHat_mul_sq_le hϱ hw0 hwL (r : ℂ)
  simp only [Complex.norm_real, Real.norm_eq_abs, Complex.ofReal_im, abs_zero, zero_mul,
    Real.exp_zero, one_mul, sq_abs] at h
  calc |phiHatR ϱ L w r| * r ^ 2 ≤ ‖phiHat ϱ L w r‖ * r ^ 2 :=
        mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right (abs_phiHatR_le_norm r) (sq_nonneg r)
    _ ≤ C1 ϱ L w := h
    _ = 2 * l1Deriv2 ϱ / w := C1_eq hϱ hw0 hwL
    _ ≤ cRho ϱ / w := div_le_div_of_nonneg_right (two_mul_l1Deriv2_le_cRho hϱ) hw0.le

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Decay/Variant4ada86c8b8bcc550c1860e1d0370ca482d66260b9894f6f7a35276eb4376e005.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Decay/Variant4ada86c8b8bcc550c1860e1d0370ca482d66260b9894f6f7a35276eb4376e005.lean#L323).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6ad9e2eb80d44633b4c0b8c20c5fe56e727a55f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
