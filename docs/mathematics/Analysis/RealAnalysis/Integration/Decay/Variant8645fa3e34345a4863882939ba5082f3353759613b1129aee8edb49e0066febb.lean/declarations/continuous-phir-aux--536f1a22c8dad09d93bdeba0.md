## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7c3ab434-eab4-a52a-76d8-2b2c1e9490be`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 552–565.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem continuous_PhiR_aux (hϱ : TaperProfile ϱ) (hw : 0 < w) (hwL : 2 * w ≤ L) :

/-! ### [eq:psiints].  We record upper bounds — every downstream citation of [eq:psiints] in §5 is
"≪ log L" or "≤ 8L".  (Paper: "a direct computation (split at |r| = 2/L and |r| = c_ϱ/2w; note
c_ϱ L/4w ≥ 1 by [eq:wrange]) gives Ψ₀ = 4 + 2 log(c_ϱ L/4w), ∫ψ²|r| = 8 + 8 log(c_ϱ L/4w),
∫ψ² ≤ 8L".) -/

/-- Constants for [eq:psiints]: A := 2/L ≤ B := c_ϱ/(2w) ("note c_ϱ L/4w ≥ 1 by
[eq:wrange]"), B/A = c_ϱ L/(4w). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Decay/Variant8645fa3e34345a4863882939ba5082f3353759613b1129aee8edb49e0066febb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Decay/Variant8645fa3e34345a4863882939ba5082f3353759613b1129aee8edb49e0066febb.lean#L552).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `67c96e7c3575ca2a9acaf1f66e4172a190ed7a42` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
