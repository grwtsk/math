## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b7f8e26cf1aba5a789e0729ff2fdaf6039ba28ffbad0d5365d0137225a364c2e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–196.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def discreteFiberFinset
    {E : Type*} [MeasurableSpace E]
    (bridge : MeasureBridgeData E) (N : ℕ) (y : E) : Finset ℕ := by
  classical
  exact (Finset.Icc 2 N).filter fun k ↦ bridge.discreteObservable k = y

/-- Exact mass of a target singleton in the finite atomic pushforward.  This
formula correctly sums every source index mapping to that target value. -/
@[surface_novel, surface_published]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PrimeWalkMeasureBridge/Variant87b657da4eac4584ff85a0717ba17a8c9c5ac803d42c87e5f40e98215eddb0b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PrimeWalkMeasureBridge/Variant87b657da4eac4584ff85a0717ba17a8c9c5ac803d42c87e5f40e98215eddb0b6.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cdce3e204f16dafa1200127c5b3e9b96e03e1021` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
