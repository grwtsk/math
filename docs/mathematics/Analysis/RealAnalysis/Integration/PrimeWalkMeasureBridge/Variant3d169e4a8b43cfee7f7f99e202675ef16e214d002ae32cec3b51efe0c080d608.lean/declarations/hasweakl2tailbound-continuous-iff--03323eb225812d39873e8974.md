## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b8dd54ae-1c2b-dc42-2205-a32f7d496a82`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 316–331.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasWeakL2TailBound_continuous_iff
    (bridge : MeasureBridgeData E) (T : ℝ) (C : ℝ≥0∞) :
    HasWeakL2TailBound (continuousWalkMeasure bridge T) C ↔
      ∀ lambda : ℝ, 0 < lambda →
        volume ({t : ℝ | lambda < ‖bridge.trajectory t‖} ∩ Ioc 0 T) ≤
          C / (ENNReal.ofReal lambda) ^ 2 := by
  unfold HasWeakL2TailBound
  constructor <;> intro h lambda hlambda
  · simpa [continuousWalkMeasure_normTail] using h lambda hlambda
  · simpa [continuousWalkMeasure_normTail] using h lambda hlambda

end NormTail

end

end Surface.Core.PrimeWalkMeasureBridge

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PrimeWalkMeasureBridge/Variant3d169e4a8b43cfee7f7f99e202675ef16e214d002ae32cec3b51efe0c080d608.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PrimeWalkMeasureBridge/Variant3d169e4a8b43cfee7f7f99e202675ef16e214d002ae32cec3b51efe0c080d608.lean#L316).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `928a2ed5e3a7bc660741ca4efb64cb452e5bc12b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
