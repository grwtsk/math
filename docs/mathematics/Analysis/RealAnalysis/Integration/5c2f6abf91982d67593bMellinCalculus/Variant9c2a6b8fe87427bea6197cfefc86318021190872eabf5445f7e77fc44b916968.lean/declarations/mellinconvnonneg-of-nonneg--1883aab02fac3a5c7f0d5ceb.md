## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:71c6e645-cfba-33f4-1574-1c90090c07ba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 751–762.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma MellinConvNonNeg_of_NonNeg {f g : ℝ → ℝ} (f_nonneg : ∀ x > 0, 0 ≤ f x)
    (g_nonneg : ∀ x > 0, 0 ≤ g x) {x : ℝ} (xpos : 0 < x) :
    0 ≤ MellinConvolution f g x := by
  dsimp [MellinConvolution]
  apply MeasureTheory.setIntegral_nonneg
  · exact measurableSet_Ioi
  · intro y ypos; simp only [mem_Ioi] at ypos
    have : 0 ≤ f y := f_nonneg _ ypos
    have : 0 < x / y := by positivity
    have : 0 ≤ g (x / y) := g_nonneg _ this
    positivity

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/5c2f6abf91982d67593bMellinCalculus/Variant9c2a6b8fe87427bea6197cfefc86318021190872eabf5445f7e77fc44b916968.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/5c2f6abf91982d67593bMellinCalculus/Variant9c2a6b8fe87427bea6197cfefc86318021190872eabf5445f7e77fc44b916968.lean#L751).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `52982ff97a3b54116682c90b714698b4c7beb983` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
