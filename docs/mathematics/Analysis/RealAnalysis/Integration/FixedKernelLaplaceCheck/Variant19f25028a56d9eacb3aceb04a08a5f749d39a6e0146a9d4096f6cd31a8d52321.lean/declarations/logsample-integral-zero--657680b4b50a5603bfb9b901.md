## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:db5f756c-9a1d-68ce-5816-c806f8b93ef5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 486–499.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem logSample_integral_zero (t : ℝ) (ht : 2 ≤ t) :
    (∫ x in Ioi (1 : ℝ), logSample t x) = 0 := by
  have hchange := integral_comp_exp_Ioi (logSample t) 0
  simp only [smul_eq_mul, Real.exp_zero] at hchange
  rw [← hchange]
  simp_rw [logSample_exp]
  rw [setIntegral_eq_integral_of_forall_compl_eq_zero]
  · exact weighted_translated_integral_zero t
  · intro r hr
    have hrle : r ≤ 0 := le_of_not_gt hr
    have hy : 1 ≤ |t - 1 - r| := (by linarith : 1 ≤ t - 1 - r).trans (le_abs_self _)
    rw [normalizedTest_zero_of_le_abs 1 (t - 1 - r) (by norm_num) hy, mul_zero]

/-- Both convergence and the cancellation hold for the unchanged source sample. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FixedKernelLaplaceCheck/Variant19f25028a56d9eacb3aceb04a08a5f749d39a6e0146a9d4096f6cd31a8d52321.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FixedKernelLaplaceCheck/Variant19f25028a56d9eacb3aceb04a08a5f749d39a6e0146a9d4096f6cd31a8d52321.lean#L486).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `720d73b26718d4c11d3c38667813e9b70f4c50fc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
