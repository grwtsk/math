## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7ca9a498-53b7-788b-dfd3-3a8e836f992d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 110–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lintegral_withDensity (κ : Kernel α β) [IsSFiniteKernel κ]
    (hf : Measurable (Function.uncurry f)) (a : α) {g : β → ℝ≥0∞} (hg : Measurable g) :
    ∫⁻ b, g b ∂withDensity κ f a = ∫⁻ b, f a b * g b ∂κ a := by
  rw [Kernel.withDensity_apply _ hf,
    lintegral_withDensity_eq_lintegral_mul _ (Measurable.of_uncurry_left hf) hg]
  simp_rw [Pi.mul_apply]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/WithDensity/Variant8f338afe7f2e90019c8c2a4da1a39e95277da95a31145d9936666812603cd95d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/WithDensity/Variant8f338afe7f2e90019c8c2a4da1a39e95277da95a31145d9936666812603cd95d.lean#L110).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `84bc1fddd889e8bf7cea60414b37e8c9d66b263d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
