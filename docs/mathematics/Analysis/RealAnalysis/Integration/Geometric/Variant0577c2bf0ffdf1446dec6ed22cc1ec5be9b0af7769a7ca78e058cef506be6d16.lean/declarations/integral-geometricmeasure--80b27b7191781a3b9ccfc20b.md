## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eddbdd03-9504-0cbf-4e38-2311378878dc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 134–144.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma integral_geometricMeasure' [CompleteSpace E] (hp : p ≠ 0)
    (hf : Integrable f (geometricMeasure p)) :
    ∫ n, f n ∂geometricMeasure p = ∑' n : ℕ, ((1 - p : ℝ) ^ n * p) • f n :=
  (hasSum_integral_geometricMeasure hp hf).tsum_eq.symm

/-- The integral of a function taking values in a finite-dimensional space
against `geometricMeasure p` is given by its sum weighted by `(1 - p) ^ n * p`. This version
does not require integrability, as the integral exists if and only if the sum exists, and otherwise
they are both defined to be zero.

See `integral_geometricMeasure'` with a general codomain which assumes integrability. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Geometric/Variant0577c2bf0ffdf1446dec6ed22cc1ec5be9b0af7769a7ca78e058cef506be6d16.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Geometric/Variant0577c2bf0ffdf1446dec6ed22cc1ec5be9b0af7769a7ca78e058cef506be6d16.lean#L134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `50d5b65064db0e278f4076f0ecbac12cd894d339` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
