## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f93f07c7-5d92-f19c-066e-e04d3c13a899`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 528–541.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem pole_contribution_tendsto {ι : Type*} {l : Filter ι}
    [l.IsCountablyGenerated]
    (A : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) (ε : ι → ℝ) (hε : ∀ i, 0 < ε i)
    (hlim : Tendsto ε l (𝓝 0)) :
    Tendsto (fun i ↦
      realPoleContribution (smoothedTest A (ε i) (hε i))) l
      (𝓝 (realPoleContribution (actualTest A))) := by
  have hp := moment_tendsto A hA ε hε hlim (1 / 2)
  have hn := moment_tendsto A hA ε hε hlim (-1 / 2)
  have hpos (x : ℝ) : (1 / 2 : ℝ) * x = x / 2 := by ring
  have hneg (x : ℝ) : (-1 / 2 : ℝ) * x = -x / 2 := by ring
  simpa only [realPoleContribution, hpos, hneg] using
    (hp.const_mul 2).mul hn

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/DominatedDescent/Variantc2dd65e66cfdf5201a5a2d99427dd7e80055e75f903c5c2f6df4a8ae1054de08.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/DominatedDescent/Variantc2dd65e66cfdf5201a5a2d99427dd7e80055e75f903c5c2f6df4a8ae1054de08.lean#L528).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `351391415cdb800d574168961b0b3bef1d55f53a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
