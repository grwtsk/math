## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a3e8f493d95c4ca19688f212d3a7b3f3b68c12a843290d57ade62a1dad95cefa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 142–157.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev HolomorphicOn (f : ℂ → E) (s : Set ℂ) : Prop :=
    DifferentiableOn ℂ f s

@[blueprint
  (title := "existsDifferentiableOn-of-bddAbove")
  (statement := /--
  If $f$ is differentiable on a set $s$ except at $c\in s$,
  and $f$ is bounded above on $s\setminus\{c\}$, then there
  exists a differentiable function $g$ on $s$ such that $f$
  and $g$ agree on $s\setminus\{c\}$.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
  This is the Riemann Removable Singularity Theorem, slightly
  rephrased from what's in Mathlib. (We don't care what the
  function $g$ is, just that it's holomorphic.)
  -/)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ResidueCalcOnRectangles/Variantaeabc76c9f569228b483b50ef200de32507fe297cdd432eab7657144c8af6cb1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ResidueCalcOnRectangles/Variantaeabc76c9f569228b483b50ef200de32507fe297cdd432eab7657144c8af6cb1.lean#L142).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `29c25e5fc47d87e488c77617fc7b877a1bcd79f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
