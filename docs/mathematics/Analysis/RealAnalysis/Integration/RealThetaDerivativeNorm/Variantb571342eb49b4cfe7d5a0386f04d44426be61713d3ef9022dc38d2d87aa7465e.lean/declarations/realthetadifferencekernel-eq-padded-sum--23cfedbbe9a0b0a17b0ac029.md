## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c0d4de58-bff9-2934-9228-c0d0dde28303`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 661–680.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    realThetaDifferenceKernel A q =
      ∑ k ∈ Icc 1 (⌊Real.exp (2 * A)⌋₊ + 1), differenceSamplingKernel A (q * (k : ℝ)) := by
  unfold realThetaDifferenceKernel
  apply sum_subset
  · intro k hk
    obtain ⟨hk1, hkB⟩ := mem_Icc.mp hk

  · intro k hk hout
    have hk' := mem_Icc.mp hk
    have hkN : k = ⌊Real.exp (2 * A)⌋₊ + 1 := by

      exact hout (mem_Icc.mpr ⟨hk'.1, by omega⟩)
    have hk0 : (0 : ℝ) < k := by exact_mod_cast (show 0 < k by omega)
    apply differenceSamplingKernel_zero_of_exp_le A _ (mul_pos (by linarith) hk0)
    have hf := Nat.lt_floor_add_one (Real.exp (2 * A))
    have hkX : Real.exp (2 * A) < (k : ℝ) := by

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/RealThetaDerivativeNorm/Variantb571342eb49b4cfe7d5a0386f04d44426be61713d3ef9022dc38d2d87aa7465e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/RealThetaDerivativeNorm/Variantb571342eb49b4cfe7d5a0386f04d44426be61713d3ef9022dc38d2d87aa7465e.lean#L661).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c2493b3f8c282529b1ff3a350e9351ce7a0bd20` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
