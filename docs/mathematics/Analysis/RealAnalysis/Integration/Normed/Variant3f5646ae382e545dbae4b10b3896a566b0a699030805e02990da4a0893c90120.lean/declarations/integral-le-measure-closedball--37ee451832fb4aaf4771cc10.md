## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fde3c585-4b76-8a86-885f-75651b96302c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–129.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integral_le_measure_closedBall : ∫ x, f x ∂μ ≤ μ.real (closedBall c f.rOut) := by calc
  ∫ x, f x ∂μ = ∫ x in closedBall c f.rOut, f x ∂μ := by
    apply (setIntegral_eq_integral_of_forall_compl_eq_zero (fun x hx ↦ ?_)).symm
    apply f.zero_of_le_dist (le_of_lt _)
    simpa using hx
  _ ≤ ∫ x in closedBall c f.rOut, 1 ∂μ := by
    apply setIntegral_mono f.integrable.integrableOn _ (fun x ↦ f.le_one)
    simp [measure_closedBall_lt_top]
  _ = μ.real (closedBall c f.rOut) := by simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Normed/Variant3f5646ae382e545dbae4b10b3896a566b0a699030805e02990da4a0893c90120.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Normed/Variant3f5646ae382e545dbae4b10b3896a566b0a699030805e02990da4a0893c90120.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `428df85afc10db92fcd7da0b898117fe2fb9311d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
