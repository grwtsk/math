## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d9686ebe-caed-bb72-ac06-bd895178e1e5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 134–144.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma shellGrowth_evenKernel_one_le {t : ℝ} (ht : 0 < t) :
    1 ≤ HurwitzZeta.evenKernel 0 t := by
  have hs := HurwitzZeta.hasSum_nat_cosKernel₀ 0 ht
  have hp : 0 ≤ ∑' n : ℕ, 2 * Real.cos (2 * Real.pi * 0 * (n + 1)) *
      Real.exp (-Real.pi * (n + 1) ^ 2 * t) :=
    tsum_nonneg (fun n ↦ by simp; positivity)
  rw [hs.tsum_eq] at hp
  rw [HurwitzZeta.evenKernel_eq_cosKernel_of_zero]
  simpa using hp


```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Combined/Variant2757f46e0b4928a334243c165e1f311e58d492816e08a7915d0e89e7c1b9a64a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Combined/Variant2757f46e0b4928a334243c165e1f311e58d492816e08a7915d0e89e7c1b9a64a.lean#L134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `308d83957645250eeb49c1c0ac619c0bee0dd4eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
