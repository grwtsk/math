## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:91f97c5a-8764-29e2-bc49-4ab0dad01a05`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 363–374.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (∫ x : ℝ, normalizedPrimitiveBump A x ^ 2) =
      (65536 / 109395 : ℝ) / sourceNormalization A := by
  have hZ : 0 < sourceNormalization A := by unfold sourceNormalization; positivity

    Real.sq_sqrt hA.le, Real.sq_sqrt hZ.le]

    Measure.integral_comp_div (fun x : ℝ ↦ sourceBump x ^ 2) A,
    sourceBump_square_integral]
  simp [abs_of_pos hA, smul_eq_mul, hA.ne']

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceCausalEnergy/Variant03e98f11d9dde7c85a54a2eff70695698d42a5646b02565e4c5702482bcea529.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceCausalEnergy/Variant03e98f11d9dde7c85a54a2eff70695698d42a5646b02565e4c5702482bcea529.lean#L363).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `37e03688cb4d9fa6cfcea6a16396cadafe82e43d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
