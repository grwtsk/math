## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8833a6c0-736f-27e0-8b4b-295bf4cdcf9e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 793–807.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsFundamentalDomain.measurePreserving_quotient_mk
    {𝓕 : Set α} (h𝓕 : IsFundamentalDomain G 𝓕 ν)
    (μ : Measure (Quotient α_mod_G)) [QuotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage ν μ] :
    MeasurePreserving π (ν.restrict 𝓕) μ where
  measurable := measurable_quotient_mk' (s := α_mod_G)
  map_eq := by
    haveI : HasFundamentalDomain G α ν := ⟨𝓕, h𝓕⟩
    rw [h𝓕.projection_respects_measure (μ := μ)]

variable [SMulInvariantMeasure G α ν] [Countable G] [MeasurableSpace G] [MeasurableSMul G α]

/-- Given a measure upstairs (i.e., on `α`), and a choice `s` of fundamental domain, there's always
an artificial way to generate a measure downstairs such that the pair satisfies the
`QuotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage` typeclass. -/
@[to_additive]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FundamentalDomain/Variant4a844153021ca491f47c5227603bcfc8f6b126d67cd6f7a19d506527e6781d90.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FundamentalDomain/Variant4a844153021ca491f47c5227603bcfc8f6b126d67cd6f7a19d506527e6781d90.lean#L793).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80045c94a7cb1b6ad5bfd47fad55bdb425cbf1a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
