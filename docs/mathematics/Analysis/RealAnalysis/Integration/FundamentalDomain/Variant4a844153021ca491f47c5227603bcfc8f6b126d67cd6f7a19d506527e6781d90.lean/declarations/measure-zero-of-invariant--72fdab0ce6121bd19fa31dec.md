## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eb313d22-3234-3856-1a3f-9c7c7b38883e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 286–294.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measure_zero_of_invariant (h : IsFundamentalDomain G s μ) (t : Set α)
    (ht : ∀ g : G, g • t = t) (hts : μ (t ∩ s) = 0) : μ t = 0 := by
  rw [measure_eq_tsum h]; simp [ht, hts]

/-- Given a measure space with an action of a finite group `G`, the measure of any `G`-invariant set
is determined by the measure of its intersection with a fundamental domain for the action of `G`. -/
@[to_additive measure_eq_card_smul_of_vadd_ae_eq_self "Given a measure space with an action of a
  finite additive group `G`, the measure of any `G`-invariant set is determined by the measure of
  its intersection with a fundamental domain for the action of `G`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FundamentalDomain/Variant4a844153021ca491f47c5227603bcfc8f6b126d67cd6f7a19d506527e6781d90.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FundamentalDomain/Variant4a844153021ca491f47c5227603bcfc8f6b126d67cd6f7a19d506527e6781d90.lean#L286).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80045c94a7cb1b6ad5bfd47fad55bdb425cbf1a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
