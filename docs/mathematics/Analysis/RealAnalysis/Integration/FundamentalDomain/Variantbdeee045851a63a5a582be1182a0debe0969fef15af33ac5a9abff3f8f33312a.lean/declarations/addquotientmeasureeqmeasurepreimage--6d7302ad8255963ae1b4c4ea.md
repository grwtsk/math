## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:856e75a43c5cc56e87c817eb8a7ae40851edc135aaa4da078818a986549e25e4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 739–754.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class AddQuotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage (ν : Measure α := by volume_tac)
    (μ : Measure (Quotient α_mod_G)) : Prop where
  addProjection_respects_measure' : ∀ (t : Set α) (_ : IsAddFundamentalDomain G t ν),
    μ = (ν.restrict t).map π

end additive

variable [Group G] [MulAction G α] [MeasurableSpace α]

local notation "α_mod_G" => MulAction.orbitRel G α

local notation "π" => @Quotient.mk _ α_mod_G

/-- Measures `ν` on `α` and `μ` on the `Quotient` of `α` mod `G` satisfy
  `QuotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage` if: for any fundamental domain `t`, and any measurable subset
  `U` of the quotient, `μ U = ν ((π ⁻¹' U) ∩ t)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FundamentalDomain/Variantbdeee045851a63a5a582be1182a0debe0969fef15af33ac5a9abff3f8f33312a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FundamentalDomain/Variantbdeee045851a63a5a582be1182a0debe0969fef15af33ac5a9abff3f8f33312a.lean#L739).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6d63790ce1c96239f0d230135a22798c75606ee3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
