## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:876f5ae8-6969-0eff-9abd-9e9baf7e701b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 540–544.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integral_iUnion {ι : Type*} [Countable ι] {s : ι → Set X} (hm : ∀ i, MeasurableSet (s i))
    (hd : Pairwise (Disjoint on s)) (hfi : μ.IntegrableOn f (⋃ i, s i)) :
    ∫ᵛ x in ⋃ n, s n, f x ∂[B; μ] = ∑' n, ∫ᵛ x in s n, f x ∂[B; μ] :=
  (HasSum.tsum_eq (hasSum_setIntegral_iUnion hm hd hfi)).symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SetIntegral/Variantf5b24b93ae44b64774b689ac318bb0fc41b88483ce74e2952086834eeb03d75c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SetIntegral/Variantf5b24b93ae44b64774b689ac318bb0fc41b88483ce74e2952086834eeb03d75c.lean#L540).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c73e89f84ce475e59e63393bd479f8e5c8ce97d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
