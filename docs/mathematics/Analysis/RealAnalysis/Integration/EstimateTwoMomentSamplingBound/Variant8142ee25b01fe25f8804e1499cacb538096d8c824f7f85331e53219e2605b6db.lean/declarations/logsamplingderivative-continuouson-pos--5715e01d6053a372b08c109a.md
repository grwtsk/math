## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:35044618-6b71-c295-2fce-3329700130ea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 47–58.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem logSamplingDerivative_continuousOn_pos
    {F : ℝ → ℝ} (hF : ContDiff ℝ 1 F)
    {x : ℝ} (hx : 0 < x) :
    ContinuousOn
      (logSamplingDerivative F x)
      (Ioi (0 : ℝ)) := by
  have h :=
    (logSamplingTerm_contDiffOn_pos hF hx)
      .continuousOn_deriv_of_isOpen isOpen_Ioi (by norm_num)
  exact h.congr fun u hu =>
    deriv_logSamplingTerm hF hx hu

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/EstimateTwoMomentSamplingBound/Variant8142ee25b01fe25f8804e1499cacb538096d8c824f7f85331e53219e2605b6db.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/EstimateTwoMomentSamplingBound/Variant8142ee25b01fe25f8804e1499cacb538096d8c824f7f85331e53219e2605b6db.lean#L47).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `077045859d21a5db0987247d29004a7e6334c399` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
