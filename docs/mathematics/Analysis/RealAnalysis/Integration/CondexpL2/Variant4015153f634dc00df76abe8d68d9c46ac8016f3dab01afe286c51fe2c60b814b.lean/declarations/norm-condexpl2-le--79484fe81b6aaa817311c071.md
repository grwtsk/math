## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f790962f-fba0-a4ec-e505-e63e41dfd510`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–112.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem norm_condexpL2_le (hm : m ≤ m0) (f : α →₂[μ] E) : ‖condexpL2 E 𝕜 hm f‖ ≤ ‖f‖ :=
  ((@condexpL2 _ E 𝕜 _ _ _ _ _ _ μ hm).le_op_norm f).trans
    (mul_le_of_le_one_left (norm_nonneg _) (norm_condexpL2_le_one hm))
#align measure_theory.norm_condexp_L2_le MeasureTheory.norm_condexpL2_le

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CondexpL2/Variant4015153f634dc00df76abe8d68d9c46ac8016f3dab01afe286c51fe2c60b814b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CondexpL2/Variant4015153f634dc00df76abe8d68d9c46ac8016f3dab01afe286c51fe2c60b814b.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93c814ed467e1eb8811ab1a1422a6fe989ad66de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
