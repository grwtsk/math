## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7605db43-7728-f36e-25f3-5e96d87d3ea6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cesaroWeight_second_abs_le_origin (A t : ℝ) (hA : 91 ≤ A)
    (ht : 0 ≤ t) :
    |deriv (deriv (cesaroWeight A)) t| ≤ 67 / A ^ 4 * t + 10 / A ^ 2 := by
  have h3 := actualCorrelation_third_abs_le hA t
  rw [abs_of_nonneg ht] at h3
  have h2 := actualCorrelation_second_abs_le_twenty hA t
  rw [cesaroWeight_second_deriv A t (by linarith : 0 < A)]
  have hb := abs_add_le
    (deriv (deriv (deriv (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A))) t)
    (deriv (deriv (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A)) t / 2)
  rw [abs_div, abs_of_pos (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) < 2)] at hb
  have h2h : |deriv (deriv (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A)) t| / 2 ≤
      10 / A ^ 2 := by
    calc
      _ ≤ (20 / A ^ 2) / 2 := div_le_div_of_nonneg_right h2 (by norm_num)
      _ = _ := by ring
  exact hb.trans (add_le_add h3 h2h)

/-- Both actual zero traces give a triangular third-derivative envelope. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SharperCesaroKernelBudget/Variant41dc1e71e93ae7409dec6aa2a6f4a2aa559925d62bf295eb5ba2ac675058ac2f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SharperCesaroKernelBudget/Variant41dc1e71e93ae7409dec6aa2a6f4a2aa559925d62bf295eb5ba2ac675058ac2f.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ccf1e18a34ee05ad818a5cbbbdf3aa1721c78f55` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
