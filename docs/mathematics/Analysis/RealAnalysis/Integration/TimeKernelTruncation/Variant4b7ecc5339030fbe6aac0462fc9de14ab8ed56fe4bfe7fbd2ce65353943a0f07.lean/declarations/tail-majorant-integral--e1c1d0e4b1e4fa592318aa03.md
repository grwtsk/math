## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ac66f3e8-3856-171f-0023-caf0725c6972`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 351–362.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tail_majorant_integral (N : ℝ) :
    (∫ t : ℝ in Ioi N, Real.exp ((1 - t) / 2) * derivativeBudget) =
      2 * derivativeBudget * Real.exp ((1 - N) / 2) := by
  have he (t : ℝ) : Real.exp ((1 - t) / 2) * derivativeBudget =
      (Real.exp (1 / 2) * derivativeBudget) * Real.exp (-(1 / 2) * t) := by
    rw [show (1 - t) / 2 = 1 / 2 + -(1 / 2) * t by ring, Real.exp_add]
    ring
  simp_rw [he]
  rw [integral_const_mul, integral_exp_mul_Ioi (a := -(1 / 2 : ℝ)) (by norm_num) N]
  rw [show (1 - N) / 2 = 1 / 2 + -(1 / 2) * N by ring, Real.exp_add]
  ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/TimeKernelTruncation/Variant4b7ecc5339030fbe6aac0462fc9de14ab8ed56fe4bfe7fbd2ce65353943a0f07.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/TimeKernelTruncation/Variant4b7ecc5339030fbe6aac0462fc9de14ab8ed56fe4bfe7fbd2ce65353943a0f07.lean#L351).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2bbb8d702d97db4e519a49318d69028d55ed3afb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
