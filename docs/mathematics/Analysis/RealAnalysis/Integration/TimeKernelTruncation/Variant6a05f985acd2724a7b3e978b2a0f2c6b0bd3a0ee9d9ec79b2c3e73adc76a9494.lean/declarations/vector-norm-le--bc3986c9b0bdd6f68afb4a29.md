## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ab00e1c1-a4c1-4a76-4b90-e1b0e6b85abb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 45–51.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem vector_norm_le (g : ℝ → ℝ) (f : FullH) :
    ‖vector g f‖ ≤ (∫ a : ℝ, ‖g a‖) * ‖f‖ := by
  calc
    _ ≤ ∫ a : ℝ, ‖(g a : ℂ) • fullShift a f‖ := norm_integral_le_integral_norm _
    _ = _ := by
      simp only [norm_smul, Complex.norm_real, LinearIsometry.norm_map, integral_mul_const]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/TimeKernelTruncation/Variant6a05f985acd2724a7b3e978b2a0f2c6b0bd3a0ee9d9ec79b2c3e73adc76a9494.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/TimeKernelTruncation/Variant6a05f985acd2724a7b3e978b2a0f2c6b0bd3a0ee9d9ec79b2c3e73adc76a9494.lean#L45).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ea12e2afea9c5f87a4e9800b8a52bc82f11eed73` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
