## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6e61fbd6-6373-f4f2-dca5-715122614a40`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 195–199.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  simp only [condexpIndL1, And.intro hs hμs, dif_pos, Ne.def, not_false_iff, and_self_iff]
#align measure_theory.condexp_ind_L1_of_measurable_set_of_measure_ne_top MeasureTheory.condexpIndL1_of_measurableSet_of_measure_ne_top

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CondexpL1/Variant7a20d99e82f9dc0d5c15fcd37e9cf07970198d17400140f44e55688f59d98bd9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CondexpL1/Variant7a20d99e82f9dc0d5c15fcd37e9cf07970198d17400140f44e55688f59d98bd9.lean#L195).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5b60ab07be3708195f1e012bc688de60f74db63b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
