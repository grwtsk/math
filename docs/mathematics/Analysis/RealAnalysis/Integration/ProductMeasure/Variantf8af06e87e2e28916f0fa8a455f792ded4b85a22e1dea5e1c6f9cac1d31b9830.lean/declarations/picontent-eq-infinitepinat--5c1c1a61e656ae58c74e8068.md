## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b309f95e-2d10-6f24-5b8d-20fbc2aa8f45`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 220–242.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem piContent_eq_infinitePiNat {A : Set (Π n, X n)} (hA : A ∈ measurableCylinders X) :
    piContent μ A = infinitePiNat μ A := by
  obtain ⟨s, S, mS, rfl⟩ : ∃ s S, MeasurableSet S ∧ A = cylinder s S := by
    simpa [mem_measurableCylinders] using hA
  rw [piContent_cylinder _ mS, cylinder, ← map_apply (measurable_restrict _) mS,
    infinitePiNat_map_restrict]

end Measure

end Nat

section InfinitePi

open Measure

/-! ### Product of infinitely many probability measures -/

variable {ι : Type*} {X : ι → Type*} {mX : ∀ i, MeasurableSpace (X i)}
  (μ : (i : ι) → Measure (X i)) [hμ : ∀ i, IsProbabilityMeasure (μ i)]

/-- If we push the product measure forward by a reindexing equivalence, we get a product measure
on the reindexed product in the sense that it coincides with `piContent μ` over
measurable cylinders. See `infinitePi_map_piCongrLeft` for a general version. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ProductMeasure/Variantf8af06e87e2e28916f0fa8a455f792ded4b85a22e1dea5e1c6f9cac1d31b9830.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ProductMeasure/Variantf8af06e87e2e28916f0fa8a455f792ded4b85a22e1dea5e1c6f9cac1d31b9830.lean#L220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d08d1f6fd3e41bf2d944035d34aa244be8f4ead8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
