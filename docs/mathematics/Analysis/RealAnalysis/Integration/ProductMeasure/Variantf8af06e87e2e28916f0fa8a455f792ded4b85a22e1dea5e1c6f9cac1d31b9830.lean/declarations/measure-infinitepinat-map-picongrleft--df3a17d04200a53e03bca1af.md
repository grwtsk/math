## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:93295e33-7897-5c42-dd53-43e34c01bd0a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–259.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Measure.infinitePiNat_map_piCongrLeft (e : ℕ ≃ ι) {s : Set (Π i, X i)}
    (hs : s ∈ measurableCylinders X) :
    (infinitePiNat (fun n ↦ μ (e n))).map (piCongrLeft X e) s = piContent μ s := by
  obtain ⟨I, S, hS, rfl⟩ := (mem_measurableCylinders s).1 hs
  rw [map_apply _ hS.cylinder, cylinder, ← Set.preimage_comp, coe_piCongrLeft,
    restrict_comp_piCongrLeft, Set.preimage_comp, ← map_apply,
    infinitePiNat_map_restrict (fun n ↦ μ (e n)), ← cylinder, piContent_cylinder μ hS,
    ← pi_map_piCongrLeft (e.restrictPreimageFinset I), map_apply _ hS, coe_piCongrLeft]
  · simp
  any_goals fun_prop
  exact hS.preimage (by fun_prop)

/-- This is the key theorem to build the product of an arbitrary family of probability measures:
the `piContent` of a decreasing sequence of cylinders with empty intersection converges to `0`.

This implies the `σ`-additivity of `piContent` (see `addContent_iUnion_eq_sum_of_tendsto_zero`),
which allows to extend it to the `σ`-algebra by Carathéodory's theorem. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ProductMeasure/Variantf8af06e87e2e28916f0fa8a455f792ded4b85a22e1dea5e1c6f9cac1d31b9830.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ProductMeasure/Variantf8af06e87e2e28916f0fa8a455f792ded4b85a22e1dea5e1c6f9cac1d31b9830.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d08d1f6fd3e41bf2d944035d34aa244be8f4ead8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
