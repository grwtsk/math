## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2013e006-23c3-7f83-f508-e7455f94bcd5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 307–315.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem smoothKernelFT_shifted (A ε : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) (hε : 0 < ε) (z : ℂ) :
    smoothKernelFT A ε hε (z / Complex.I) =
      smoothedBilateralTransform A ε hε z ^ 2 := by
  rw [smoothKernelFT_eq_square A ε hA hε]
  have hI : Complex.I * (z / Complex.I) = z := by
    field_simp
  rw [hI]

/-- Both original pole moments vanish before any explicit-formula specialization. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SmoothExplicitFormula/Variantc74b4357242af28c5a398595a3ac93040facd4e4e6c2670ef8d4ccd3b87d0c19.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SmoothExplicitFormula/Variantc74b4357242af28c5a398595a3ac93040facd4e4e6c2670ef8d4ccd3b87d0c19.lean#L307).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a4d0ecee183686a9028c465233acd57b64fc3b6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
