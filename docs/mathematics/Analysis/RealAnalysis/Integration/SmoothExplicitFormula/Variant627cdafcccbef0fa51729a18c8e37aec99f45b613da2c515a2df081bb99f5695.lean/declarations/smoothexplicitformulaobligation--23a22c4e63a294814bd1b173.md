## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6d34a8b90ffe712d198514117d0a3a11cbc46e30838b56b8e6b7fe16e39f1f88`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 326–335.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def SmoothExplicitFormulaObligation : Prop :=
  ∀ A : ℝ, 1 ≤ A → ∀ (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε), ε ≤ 1 →
    HasSum (fun o : ZeroOccurrence ↦
      smoothedBilateralTransform A ε hε (shiftedValue o) ^ 2)
      (BridgeAdmissibility.realArithmeticForm (A + 1)
        (smoothedTest A ε hε) : ℂ)

/-- All source-side analytic hypotheses needed by Z2.6 are proved.  The only
remaining Z2.6 step is the actual Weil explicit-formula equality represented by
`SmoothExplicitFormulaObligation`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SmoothExplicitFormula/Variant627cdafcccbef0fa51729a18c8e37aec99f45b613da2c515a2df081bb99f5695.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SmoothExplicitFormula/Variant627cdafcccbef0fa51729a18c8e37aec99f45b613da2c515a2df081bb99f5695.lean#L326).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f092d2a08e049e55de14dc1053b4bccde602832b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
