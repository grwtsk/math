## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6b0acd77-8290-3c55-c9db-8ce5fbfeb516`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 321–330.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem circleIntegrable_congr {c : ℂ} {R : ℝ} {f₁ f₂ : ℂ → E}
    (hf : Set.EqOn f₁ f₂ (sphere c |R|)) :
    CircleIntegrable f₁ c R ↔ CircleIntegrable f₂ c R :=
  intervalIntegrable_congr fun x _ ↦ hf (circleMap_mem_sphere' c R x)

@[deprecated (since := "2026-04-26")] alias crcleIntegrable_congr := circleIntegrable_congr

/--
Circle integrability is invariant when taking negative radius.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CircleIntegral/Variantcb2715df8481a552c667088a2906445a7dfba96a4613c1a6cee25eb90a22475a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CircleIntegral/Variantcb2715df8481a552c667088a2906445a7dfba96a4613c1a6cee25eb90a22475a.lean#L321).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9bf325246cf83f7d0712dfc65aa77cb722bd98ea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
