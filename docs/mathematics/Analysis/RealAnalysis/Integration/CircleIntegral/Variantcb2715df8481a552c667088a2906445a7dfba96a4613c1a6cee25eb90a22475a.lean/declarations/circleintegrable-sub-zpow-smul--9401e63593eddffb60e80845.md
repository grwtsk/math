## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c90330f-8431-43ac-2544-fbf4a4b3bc88`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 426–432.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem CircleIntegrable.sub_zpow_smul {f : ℂ → E} {c w : ℂ} {R : ℝ} (n : ℤ)
    (hf : CircleIntegrable f c R) (hw : w ∉ sphere c |R|) :
    CircleIntegrable (fun z ↦ (z - w) ^ n • f z) c R :=
  hf.fun_continuousOn_smul <| (continuousOn_id.sub continuousOn_const).zpow₀ n
    fun _ hz ↦ Or.inl (sub_ne_zero.2 (ne_of_mem_of_not_mem hz hw))

/-- Definition for $\oint_{|z-c|=R} f(z)\,dz$ -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CircleIntegral/Variantcb2715df8481a552c667088a2906445a7dfba96a4613c1a6cee25eb90a22475a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CircleIntegral/Variantcb2715df8481a552c667088a2906445a7dfba96a4613c1a6cee25eb90a22475a.lean#L426).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9bf325246cf83f7d0712dfc65aa77cb722bd98ea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
