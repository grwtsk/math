## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e3267ff9-4c06-0fc9-b801-54075167bef8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 208–215.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem fixedKernel_zero_of_nonpos (t : ℝ) (ht : t ≤ 0) : fixedKernel t = 0 := by
  suffices h : ∀ n : ℕ, logSample t (n + 1) = 0 by simp only [fixedKernel, h, tsum_zero]
  intro n
  apply logSample_zero_of_time_le_log
  have hlog : 0 ≤ Real.log (n + 1 : ℝ) := Real.log_nonneg (by have := (show (0 : ℝ) ≤ n from Nat.cast_nonneg n); linarith)
  linarith

/-- Every compact time interval is represented by a fixed continuous finite source sum. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FixedSourceKernel/Variantb70eee5dee10d135b7f1c2fd09f70abc3d3f0a5ab7c4ed83fb229439e8c0849d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FixedSourceKernel/Variantb70eee5dee10d135b7f1c2fd09f70abc3d3f0a5ab7c4ed83fb229439e8c0849d.lean#L208).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a98adaf75ee042dc6a7e5f7abf9ec9218d351b29` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
