## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:847b6692-1f7e-1348-449a-6ee5fcc70c08`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 251–258.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem profile_compact : HasCompactSupport sampleDerivativeProfile := by
  have h : HasCompactSupport (fun x => -v x * (2 : ℝ)⁻¹) :=
    (normalizedTest_hasCompactSupport 1 (by norm_num)).neg.mul_right
  unfold sampleDerivativeProfile
  simp_rw [div_eq_mul_inv]
  exact h.sub (normalizedTest_hasCompactSupport 1 (by norm_num)).deriv

/-- Differentiation keeps the source value and derivative with both negative signs. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FixedKernelLaplaceStatements/Variantd260c27367cbe8c3a53a3c087efe5b926a1d150cbbf03e1490e387a06386a313.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FixedKernelLaplaceStatements/Variantd260c27367cbe8c3a53a3c087efe5b926a1d150cbbf03e1490e387a06386a313.lean#L251).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e40a0f6e6683d6ea96e1cf0923dd6b1d4b16021` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
