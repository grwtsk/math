## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6a08685e-debd-a9e3-68db-b95ca8a5914e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 755–762.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem repairedTransfer_zero_occurrence (o : ZeroObject.ZeroOccurrence) :
    repairedTransfer (ZeroObject.shiftedValue o) = 0 := by
  rw [repairedTransfer_eq_product _ (ZeroObject.shiftedValue_ne_half o)]
  rw [show (1 / 2 : ℂ) + ZeroObject.shiftedValue o = o.1.val by
    unfold ZeroObject.shiftedValue; ring, o.1.property.1]
  simp

/-- Any finite-valued replacement of zeta retains the source's zero at the pole. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FixedKernelLaplaceStatements/Variantb2afe2a4cad7e7473dc712ea0802ef6979059dcb3c98ad049625c9b9bba3c45f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FixedKernelLaplaceStatements/Variantb2afe2a4cad7e7473dc712ea0802ef6979059dcb3c98ad049625c9b9bba3c45f.lean#L755).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6425894aa0fa0145ce012e28eeab799803be2b7b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
