## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dd2b0c19-34a5-1fad-ef8c-6d0bfbf6d91a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 186–196.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem shifted_controller_inner (a b : ℝ) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) (u v : ℝ) :
    inner ℂ (fullShift u (zeroExtension (controller a ha)))
      (fullShift v (zeroExtension (controller b hb))) = (overlap a b u v : ℂ) := by
  by_cases huv : u ≤ v
  · exact (shifted_controller_inner_of_le a b ha hb u v huv).trans (by simp [overlap, huv])
  · rw [← inner_conj_symm,
      shifted_controller_inner_of_le b a hb ha v u (le_of_not_ge huv)]
    rw [Complex.conj_ofReal]
    simp only [overlap, if_neg huv, add_comm]

/-- The exact overlap is bounded uniformly before integration against signed source weights. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FullAudit/Variant516940c539c1525493af70670b8da8f0c36a27c2e5142975346217cbd6d2757c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FullAudit/Variant516940c539c1525493af70670b8da8f0c36a27c2e5142975346217cbd6d2757c.lean#L186).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b377932567934ade5ff070ca3203d60cec461170` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
