## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c0c06e2c-859b-e428-9ad0-70d048a8a2b9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 543–569.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- The improper sum of residues of `f` over `S`, in the sense of the ladder `l`: sum the residues
in the truncation `S ∩ {z | σ n < ℜ z}` and let `n → ∞` (so `σ n → -∞` exhausts `S` from the
right). This is the convention of \cite{CH2} for regions with infinitely many poles --- e.g. the
trivial zeros of `ζ` on the negative real axis, where the ordinary `sumResiduesIn` `tsum` need not
converge --- and it reduces to `sumResiduesIn f S` when the poles of `f` in `S` are finite (the
content of `lemma_5_1_g`). -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CH2/Variant04d2846d4699a4b555dd3721d3efff047f35c60e1d7af99ccdc6110fb25f3490.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CH2/Variant04d2846d4699a4b555dd3721d3efff047f35c60e1d7af99ccdc6110fb25f3490.lean#L543).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
