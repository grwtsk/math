## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ec9f79817b3438cd162ea7c2a3eef376e83902957d56e69dc050bc3069334ddb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def MtotalChiA (p : Setting) (F : LocalFun) : ℝ :=
  Mform F.Phi p.T (nuXc κ q c p.X) (nuXc κ q c p.X)

section RegimeChi

/-- From H-Γ(χ)'s Stirling bound: `|μ_χ| ≤ C·l` on `[T, 2T]` for large `T` (C = C(κ,q)). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PrimeSideChi/Variant748e97b8fc0f5bb617457b57861469ab1313eef2b8ffdf150603343ec0d200ca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PrimeSideChi/Variant748e97b8fc0f5bb617457b57861469ab1313eef2b8ffdf150603343ec0d200ca.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bdfbbe56c3098980c3d63ba72430b2e80671deeb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
