## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4490ed81-e2a8-e77d-6308-cc6943d36dd5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 413–422.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem perronTerm_integrable (c x : ℝ) (hc : 0 < c) (hx : 0 < x) (n : ℕ) :
    Integrable (perronTerm c x n) := by
  have hm : Measurable (perronTerm c x n) := by
    unfold perronTerm perronIntegrand LSeries.term

    ‖LSeries.term (fun m => (ArithmeticFunction.moebius m : ℂ)) (1 + (c : ℂ)) n‖

/-- Summability of the full L1 norms is established before exchanging the infinite series and integral. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MobiusPerronCombined/Variant003979e3f27b8d49eca6b7e99c26f56a37bca0137d558efb77af02ddcc03fb16.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MobiusPerronCombined/Variant003979e3f27b8d49eca6b7e99c26f56a37bca0137d558efb77af02ddcc03fb16.lean#L413).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `eb9e8c79588b6d6b5878a391564e142feac31fb7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
