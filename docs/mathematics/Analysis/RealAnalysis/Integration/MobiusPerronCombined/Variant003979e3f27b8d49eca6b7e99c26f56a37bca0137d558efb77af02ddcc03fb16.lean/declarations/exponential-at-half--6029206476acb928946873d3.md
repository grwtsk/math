## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f9b920e1-d40b-0ecf-c1e8-facb4c706bd1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 247–256.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exponential_at_half (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 ≤ n) :
    Complex.exp (-(1 / 2 + (1 / 2 : ℂ)) * (Real.log (n : ℝ) : ℂ)) =
      (n : ℂ)⁻¹ := by
  have hn0 : 0 < (n : ℝ) := by exact_mod_cast (show 0 < n by omega)
  have h : -(1 / 2 + (1 / 2 : ℂ)) * (Real.log (n : ℝ) : ℂ) =
      ((-Real.log (n : ℝ) : ℝ) : ℂ) := by push_cast; ring
  rw [h, ← Complex.ofReal_exp, Real.exp_neg, Real.exp_log hn0, Complex.ofReal_inv]

/-- The finite numerator at one half is exactly the original signed reciprocal sum. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MobiusPerronCombined/Variant003979e3f27b8d49eca6b7e99c26f56a37bca0137d558efb77af02ddcc03fb16.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MobiusPerronCombined/Variant003979e3f27b8d49eca6b7e99c26f56a37bca0137d558efb77af02ddcc03fb16.lean#L247).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `eb9e8c79588b6d6b5878a391564e142feac31fb7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
