## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c2617b72-553b-e1cb-90e3-9bb2796a08fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 96–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actual_source_log_ae (A : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    logMap (actualSourceL2 A hA) =ᵐ[volume]
      (fun u => (normalizedTest Realization.explicitSecondDerivative A u : ℂ)) := by
  filter_upwards [logMap_ae (actualSourceL2 A hA),
    exp_quasi.ae_eq_comp (actualSourceL2_ae A hA)] with u hu hf
  dsimp only [Function.comp_apply] at hf
  rw [hu,logFunc,hf]
  exact actual_source_log_pointwise A u

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LogMellin/Variantc8f5b86433ba41f1498d1744103554ac4c9a3ac7a852a3df4dde4d23445d1ae3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LogMellin/Variantc8f5b86433ba41f1498d1744103554ac4c9a3ac7a852a3df4dde4d23445d1ae3.lean#L96).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `12d063c85d518c795f1028a7eb4770207febb341` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
