## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cae2fe6e-1ae9-53ac-6513-f43256476970`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–55.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem certified_integral_traversal_obeys_affine_bound
    (actual : Nat → Nat)
    (gain localDefect initialDefect : Nat)
    (initial : actual 0 ≤ initialDefect)
    (step :
      ∀ n, actual (n + 1) ≤
        gain * actual n + localDefect) :
    ∀ n, actual n ≤
      constantAffineBound gain localDefect initialDefect n :=
  iterated_affine_defect_bound
    actual gain localDefect initialDefect initial step

/-!
This theorem is intentionally scoped to an integral gain.  In particular it
does not establish general sub-unit geometric convergence.  Such claims use a
`ScaledDerivativeGainCertificate` plus separately discharged completeness and
basin obligations.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Contraction/Variant07e664afdaa1dce6364508e60ee4e130c9e5689328a8218cf49e4fd02e4c1135.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Contraction/Variant07e664afdaa1dce6364508e60ee4e130c9e5689328a8218cf49e4fd02e4c1135.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `019b25eb2a23fa45b10b92818cfc990dce615018` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
