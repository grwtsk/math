## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4bf8673f-1c5a-1d71-dbae-3cc35a3a91e5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 153–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem circleAverage_congr_sphere {f₁ f₂ : ℂ → E} (hf : Set.EqOn f₁ f₂ (sphere c |R|)) :
    circleAverage f₁ c R = circleAverage f₂ c R := by
  unfold circleAverage
  congr 1
  exact intervalIntegral.integral_congr (fun x ↦ by simp [hf (circleMap_mem_sphere' c R x)])

/--
Express the circle average over an arbitrary circle as a circle average over the unit circle.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CircleAverage/Variantba1b32a953688a1d699dd219a7fa9f2d8e31510a5dffe90e9e414a0d3fdb8b82.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CircleAverage/Variantba1b32a953688a1d699dd219a7fa9f2d8e31510a5dffe90e9e414a0d3fdb8b82.lean#L153).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0a5c6411b3c4ad01a2c8735136368d2f872e0601` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
