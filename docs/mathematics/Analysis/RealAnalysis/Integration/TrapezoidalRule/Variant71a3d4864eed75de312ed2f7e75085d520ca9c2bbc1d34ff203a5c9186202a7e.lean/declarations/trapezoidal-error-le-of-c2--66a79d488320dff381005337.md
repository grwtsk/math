## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d57c4321-dffd-b565-87d0-35de9ee8a359`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 261–273.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem trapezoidal_error_le_of_c2 {f : ℝ → ℝ} {a b : ℝ} (h_f_c2 : ContDiffOn ℝ 2 f [[a, b]])
    {ζ : ℝ} (fpp_bound : ∀ x, |iteratedDerivWithin 2 f [[a, b]] x| ≤ ζ) {N : ℕ}
    (N_nonzero : 0 < N) : |trapezoidal_error f N a b| ≤ |b - a| ^ 3 * ζ / (12 * N ^ 2) := by
  -- This use of rcases slightly duplicates effort from the proof of trapezoidal_error_le, but doing
  -- it any other way that I can think of would be worse.
  rcases eq_or_ne a b with h_eq | h_ne
  · simp [h_eq]
  -- Once we have a ≠ b, all the necessary assumptions on f follow pretty quickly from its being
  -- C^2.
  have h_ddf : DifferentiableOn ℝ (derivWithin f [[a, b]]) [[a, b]] := by
    rw [← iteratedDerivWithin_one]
    exact h_f_c2.differentiableOn_iteratedDerivWithin (by norm_cast) (uniqueDiffOn_uIcc h_ne)
  exact trapezoidal_error_le (h_f_c2.differentiableOn two_ne_zero) h_ddf fpp_bound N_nonzero
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/TrapezoidalRule/Variant71a3d4864eed75de312ed2f7e75085d520ca9c2bbc1d34ff203a5c9186202a7e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/TrapezoidalRule/Variant71a3d4864eed75de312ed2f7e75085d520ca9c2bbc1d34ff203a5c9186202a7e.lean#L261).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `adf07a042f3966614958fb73239bd0b7eac37dbb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
