## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f16e66e0-572c-e5b5-edb8-42a9f0ebe526`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 4184–4189.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem corollary_26 : Eπ.bound 0.4298 2 := by
  intro x hx
  have h1 := corollary_23 0.826 0.25 1.00 1.000 table6_mem
  exact le_trans (h1 x (by linarith)) (admissible_bound_le_0826 x (by linarith))

end FKS2
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Lemma10Substep86c747f4a149/Variant13318ed7369122d67b7527abd125f40dcb9ad2078310279224ea1cd6af5ee91d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Lemma10Substep86c747f4a149/Variant13318ed7369122d67b7527abd125f40dcb9ad2078310279224ea1cd6af5ee91d.lean#L4184).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
