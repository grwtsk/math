## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1b4a85ba-7566-943e-37d1-7d9bc24a8093`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 552–586.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma two_mul_sqrt_div_le_quarter (t : ℝ) (ht : t ≥ 1000) :
    2 * Real.sqrt (t / 5.5666305) ≤ t / 4 := by
  -- Suggested proof:
  -- 1) note `t > 0` and `0 < (5.5666305:ℝ)`.
  -- 2) square both sides using `Real.mul_self_le_mul_self_iff` (or `sq_le_sq`),
  --    reducing to `4*(t/5.5666305) ≤ (t/4)^2`.
  -- 3) simplify to `t ≥ 64/5.5666305`, then use `ht` and `norm_num`.

/--
A very crude upper bound on `BKLNW.a₁` at large `t`.
You can make this as weak as you like; `≤ 2` is plenty.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Lemma10Substep86c747f4a149/Variant13318ed7369122d67b7527abd125f40dcb9ad2078310279224ea1cd6af5ee91d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Lemma10Substep86c747f4a149/Variant13318ed7369122d67b7527abd125f40dcb9ad2078310279224ea1cd6af5ee91d.lean#L552).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
