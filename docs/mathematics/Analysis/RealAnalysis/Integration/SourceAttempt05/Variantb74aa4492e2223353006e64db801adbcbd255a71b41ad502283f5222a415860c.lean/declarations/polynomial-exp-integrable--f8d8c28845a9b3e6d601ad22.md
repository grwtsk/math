## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2b1ddcb7-ae65-df7c-2454-bad7e53707e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–57.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem polynomial_exp_integrable (n : ℕ) :
    IntegrableOn (fun t : ℝ => t ^ n * Real.exp (-t / 2)) (Ioi 0) := by
  have h := integrableOn_rpow_mul_exp_neg_mul_rpow
    (s := (n : ℝ)) (p := 1) (b := 1 / 2)
    (lt_of_lt_of_le (by norm_num : (-1 : ℝ) < 0) (Nat.cast_nonneg n))
    (by norm_num) (by norm_num)
  have he (t : ℝ) : -(1 / 2 : ℝ) * t = -t / 2 := by ring
  simpa only [Real.rpow_natCast, Real.rpow_one, he] using h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceAttempt05/Variantb74aa4492e2223353006e64db801adbcbd255a71b41ad502283f5222a415860c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceAttempt05/Variantb74aa4492e2223353006e64db801adbcbd255a71b41ad502283f5222a415860c.lean#L49).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b1c91e488b06ada337a38f851d466959a902a924` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
