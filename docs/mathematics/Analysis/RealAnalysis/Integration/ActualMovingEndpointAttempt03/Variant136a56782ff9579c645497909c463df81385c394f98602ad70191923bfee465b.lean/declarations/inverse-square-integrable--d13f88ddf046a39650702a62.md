## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7b30805a-b604-b08e-d0c9-bbc36596dbdf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–56.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem inverse_square_integrable {T : ℝ} (hT : 0 < T) :
    IntegrableOn (fun t : ℝ => 1/t^2) (Ioi T) := by
  simpa only [inverse_square_eq_rpow] using
    integrableOn_Ioi_rpow_of_lt (by norm_num : (-2:ℝ)< -1) hT

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ActualMovingEndpointAttempt03/Variant136a56782ff9579c645497909c463df81385c394f98602ad70191923bfee465b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ActualMovingEndpointAttempt03/Variant136a56782ff9579c645497909c463df81385c394f98602ad70191923bfee465b.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c556f70cfd1e98d377efb8ca04f519139232c99d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
