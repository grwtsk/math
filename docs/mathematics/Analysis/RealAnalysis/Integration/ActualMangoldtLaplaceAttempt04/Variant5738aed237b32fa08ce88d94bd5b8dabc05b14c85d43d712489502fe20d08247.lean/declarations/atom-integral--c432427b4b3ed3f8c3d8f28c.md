## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c82fd2d7-6f3a-0aa9-489b-6197b91fef0d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–56.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem atom_integral {s : ℝ} (hs : 0 < s) (n : ℕ) :
    (∫ t : ℝ, laplaceAtom s n t) =
      (mangoldtWeight n * Real.exp (-s * Real.log ((n+2 : ℕ) : ℝ))) / s := by
  unfold laplaceAtom
  rw [integral_indicator measurableSet_Ici, integral_const_mul,
    integral_Ici_eq_integral_Ioi,integral_exp_mul_Ioi (by linarith : -s < 0)]
  ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ActualMangoldtLaplaceAttempt04/Variant5738aed237b32fa08ce88d94bd5b8dabc05b14c85d43d712489502fe20d08247.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ActualMangoldtLaplaceAttempt04/Variant5738aed237b32fa08ce88d94bd5b8dabc05b14c85d43d712489502fe20d08247.lean#L49).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `47245c9b88f638ae0cdeafc5a040645d74cefc4f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
