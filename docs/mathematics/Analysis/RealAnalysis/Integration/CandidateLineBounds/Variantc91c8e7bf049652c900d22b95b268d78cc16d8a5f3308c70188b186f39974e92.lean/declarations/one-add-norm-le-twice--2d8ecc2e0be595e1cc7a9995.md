## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:971e31d5-efb9-0392-28ef-02daec04ce40`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 430–441.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem one_add_norm_le_twice (w : ℂ) (hw : 0 ≤ w.re) :
    1 + ‖w‖ ≤ 2 * ‖1 + w‖ := by
  have h1 : 1 ≤ ‖1 + w‖ := by
    have h := Complex.re_le_norm (1 + w)
    simp only [Complex.add_re, Complex.one_re] at h
    linarith
  have hsq : ‖w‖^2 ≤ ‖1+w‖^2 := by
    simp only [← Complex.normSq_eq_norm_sq, Complex.normSq_apply,
      Complex.add_re, Complex.one_re, Complex.add_im, Complex.one_im, zero_add]
    nlinarith
  nlinarith [norm_nonneg w, norm_nonneg (1+w)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CandidateLineBounds/Variantc91c8e7bf049652c900d22b95b268d78cc16d8a5f3308c70188b186f39974e92.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CandidateLineBounds/Variantc91c8e7bf049652c900d22b95b268d78cc16d8a5f3308c70188b186f39974e92.lean#L430).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4793a667b01d80b377a6c725ac8e8421d3cef98a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
