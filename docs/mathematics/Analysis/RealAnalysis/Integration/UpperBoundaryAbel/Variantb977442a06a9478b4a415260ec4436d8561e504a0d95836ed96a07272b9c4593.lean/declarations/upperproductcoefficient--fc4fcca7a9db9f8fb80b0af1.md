## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3dfd9cd1e773a917e0fdbf0248e690715027e15e9a9b40c8ecc727e9d73dab13`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 11–16.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def upperProductCoefficient (N n : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  ∑ i ∈ Ioc (N / 2) N, ∑ j ∈ Ioc (N / 2) N,
    if i * j = n then
      (ArithmeticFunction.moebius i : ℝ) * (ArithmeticFunction.moebius j : ℝ) else 0

/-- Closed-right cumulative product coefficients, with all original Möbius signs. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/UpperBoundaryAbel/Variantb977442a06a9478b4a415260ec4436d8561e504a0d95836ed96a07272b9c4593.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/UpperBoundaryAbel/Variantb977442a06a9478b4a415260ec4436d8561e504a0d95836ed96a07272b9c4593.lean#L11).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ae2710ea67deeec2207f13af925c677e92c3db40` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
