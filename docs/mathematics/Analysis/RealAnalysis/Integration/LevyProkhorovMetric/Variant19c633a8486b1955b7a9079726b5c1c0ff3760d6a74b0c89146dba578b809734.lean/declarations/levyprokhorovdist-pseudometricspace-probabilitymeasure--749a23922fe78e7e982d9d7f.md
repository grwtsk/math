## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6f361b04b4478ceb532bbc4c6672fd4da5ebcb29bf83990dac670043aa3ff0ff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 262–269.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable instance levyProkhorovDist_pseudoMetricSpace_probabilityMeasure :
    PseudoMetricSpace (LevyProkhorov (ProbabilityMeasure Ω)) where
  dist μ ν := levyProkhorovDist μ.toMeasure ν.toMeasure
  dist_self _ := levyProkhorovDist_self _
  dist_comm _ _ := levyProkhorovDist_comm _ _
  dist_triangle _ _ _ := levyProkhorovDist_triangle _ _ _
  edist_dist μ ν := by simp [← ENNReal.ofReal_coe_nnreal]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LevyProkhorovMetric/Variant19c633a8486b1955b7a9079726b5c1c0ff3760d6a74b0c89146dba578b809734.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LevyProkhorovMetric/Variant19c633a8486b1955b7a9079726b5c1c0ff3760d6a74b0c89146dba578b809734.lean#L262).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `122cb03ed4e30f9bd309bbab3335759e5d4091df` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
