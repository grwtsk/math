## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8a942fea-1bf6-b82f-96e5-41f3b0e512eb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 687–701.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem integrable_smul {f : E → F} {μ : Measure E}
    (φ : 𝓓^{n}(Ω, ℝ)) (hf : LocallyIntegrableOn f Ω μ) :
    Integrable (fun x ↦ φ x • f x) μ :=
  φ.integrable_bilin (ContinuousLinearMap.lsmul ℝ ℝ) hf

/-- A test function on `Ω` is `μ`-integrable for any measure `μ` on `E` satisfying
`LocallyIntegrableOn 1 Ω μ`. Note that this is a weaker assumption than both
- `IsLocallyFiniteMeasure (μ.restrict Ω)` (because we say nothing about points outside of `Ω`)
- `IsFiniteMeasureOnCompacts (μ.restrict Ω)` (because we say nothing about compacts not
  contained in `Ω`)

For example, if `μ` is the measure with density `fun (x : ℝ) ↦ x⁻¹` with respect to the Lebesgue
measure and `Ω` is the open set `Ioo 0 1`, we have `LocallyIntegrableOn 1 Ω μ` (hence `μ` defines
a distribution on `Ω`) but the other two conditions are not satisfied.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/TestFunction/Variantea65ab43ca4080d4508547eaac8798a5b3d801d8a70567e67899f3bd1413fa9d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/TestFunction/Variantea65ab43ca4080d4508547eaac8798a5b3d801d8a70567e67899f3bd1413fa9d.lean#L687).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ca681424f7944753552721b0a54ba3dd378cd43e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
