## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5296925d-f8f5-6d10-34e2-0a1b83435ba0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 30–42.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem primitive_hasDerivAt {x : ℝ} (hx : 0 < x) :
    HasDerivAt logPowerPrimitive (logPower x) x := by
  have hh := (((Real.hasDerivAt_log hx.ne').add_const 2).const_mul (-2)).mul
    (Real.hasDerivAt_rpow_const (p:=-(1:ℝ)/2) (Or.inl hx.ne'))
  have he : x⁻¹*x^(-(1:ℝ)/2) = x^(-(3:ℝ)/2) := by
    rw [← Real.rpow_neg_one, ← Real.rpow_add hx]
    norm_num
  rw [show -(1:ℝ)/2-1=-(3:ℝ)/2 by norm_num] at hh
  have he2 : -2*x⁻¹*x^(-(1:ℝ)/2) = -2*x^(-(3:ℝ)/2) := by rw [mul_assoc,he]
  rw [he2] at hh
  unfold logPowerPrimitive logPower
  convert! hh using 1 <;> first | rfl | ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LogPowerTailAttempt02/Variant98bdc4eedc482cf5e1de31fa779a34f1f39f6d875cda765ad1b6393d103a386c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LogPowerTailAttempt02/Variant98bdc4eedc482cf5e1de31fa779a34f1f39f6d875cda765ad1b6393d103a386c.lean#L30).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2f90a3dc2508663de667e1f796655ada0cb3893e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
