## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bca9bc40-a97c-59c0-fbb8-31ba641544b6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–235.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem full_correlation_moment_zero (A : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    (∫ t, Real.exp ((1 / 2 : ℝ) * t) *
      sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A t) = 0 := by
  change (∫ t, Real.exp ((1 / 2 : ℝ) * t) *
    correlation (normalizedTest explicitSecondDerivative A) t) = 0
  rw [weighted_correlation_integral _ _
    (weighted_normalizedTest_integrable A (1 / 2) hA)
    (weighted_normalizedTest_integrable A (-(1 / 2)) hA),
    weighted_normalizedTest_integral_zero A (1 / 2) hA (by norm_num), zero_mul]

/-- Exact RH-0011 equation (8) for the actual normalized correlation, on every admitted radius.
The only hypothesis is `A≥1`; no full realization or arithmetic representation is assumed. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CorrelationMoment/Variant60485892d97a3205d9dde8c31993c12a97328f0dfed4e0f0ff752fd030716541.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CorrelationMoment/Variant60485892d97a3205d9dde8c31993c12a97328f0dfed4e0f0ff752fd030716541.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `37fa3bd5de1a7a19e39a9bafe00e49b823aaa9c6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
