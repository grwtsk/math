## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ba2ce046-e68a-2893-bd13-bdee3b96cab1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 82–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem first_prime_block_weight_pos : (0 : ℝ) < 1 - 1 / Real.sqrt 2 := by
  have hp : 0 < Real.sqrt 2 := Real.sqrt_pos.mpr (by norm_num)
  have hs : 1 < Real.sqrt 2 := by
    nlinarith [Real.sq_sqrt (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) ≤ 2)]
  have hi : 1 / Real.sqrt 2 < 1 := (div_lt_one hp).2 hs
  linarith

/-- No earlier logarithmic scale has crossed zero. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variant0a1f5cf4a1956059365c8f493986ed005fa83af7181b96b43d7692e8620c87f1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variant0a1f5cf4a1956059365c8f493986ed005fa83af7181b96b43d7692e8620c87f1.lean#L82).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93b3e1df1edd6d6f55a291a43f55be52f3387428` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
