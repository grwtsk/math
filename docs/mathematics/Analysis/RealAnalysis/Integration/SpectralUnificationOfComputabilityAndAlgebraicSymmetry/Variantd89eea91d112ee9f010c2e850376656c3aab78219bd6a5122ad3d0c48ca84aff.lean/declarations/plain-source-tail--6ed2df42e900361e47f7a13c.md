## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d092ba69-3886-aafa-dcec-c70429b42d67`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 446–459.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  have hu0 : 0 < u := (Real.exp_pos (2*A)).trans hxu
  have hlogu : 2*A ≤ Real.log u := (Real.le_log_iff_exp_le hu0).2 hxu.le
  have hlogx := Real.log_nonneg hx
  have hz := sourceCorrelation_eq_zero_of_two_mul_le_abs A
    (Real.log x + Real.log u) (by linarith)
    ((by linarith : 2*A ≤ Real.log x + Real.log u).trans (le_abs_self _))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variantd89eea91d112ee9f010c2e850376656c3aab78219bd6a5122ad3d0c48ca84aff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variantd89eea91d112ee9f010c2e850376656c3aab78219bd6a5122ad3d0c48ca84aff.lean#L446).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `036f32b561ee1b123ecf027cc5dd681753c54012` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
