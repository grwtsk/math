## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:571cb301-747c-dd3f-cb55-eb6cc2c92b9a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actualComplexEndpointIntegrand_aestronglyMeasurable (A : ℝ) (z : ℂ) :
    AEStronglyMeasurable (actualComplexEndpointIntegrand A z)
      (volume.restrict (Ioi 0)) := by
  have hp : AEStronglyMeasurable (endpointPolynomial A)
      (volume.restrict (Ioi 0)) := (endpointPolynomial_continuous A).aestronglyMeasurable
  have hi := hp.indicator (s := Icc 0 (2 * A)) measurableSet_Icc
  have hf : AEStronglyMeasurable (fun u : ℝ => (actualEndpointExtension A u : ℂ))
      (volume.restrict (Ioi 0)) := Complex.continuous_ofReal.comp_aestronglyMeasurable hi
  have hg : AEStronglyMeasurable (fun u : ℝ => Complex.exp (-z * (u : ℂ)))
      (volume.restrict (Ioi 0)) :=
    (by fun_prop : Continuous (fun u : ℝ => Complex.exp (-z * (u : ℂ)))).aestronglyMeasurable
  exact hf.mul hg

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualComplexEndpointAsymptotic/Variant7015413a88654edd6ec863a4bd33081385ca208a8b9ab2f2616d6b257f6c387e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualComplexEndpointAsymptotic/Variant7015413a88654edd6ec863a4bd33081385ca208a8b9ab2f2616d6b257f6c387e.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d4ff8492fb125a566c1db7f45e1e0ce9f8ac7bf9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
