## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f8d086d13d1c3cd42e9a548bc2e7a86988dd56d86ef0eb322be7aa64a58cf463`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 40–50.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def condVar : Ω → ℝ := μ[(X - μ[X | m]) ^ 2 | m]

@[inherit_doc] scoped notation "Var[" X "; " μ " | " m "]" => condVar m X μ

/-- Conditional variance of a real-valued random variable. It is defined as `0` if any one of the
following conditions is true:
- `m` is not a sub-σ-algebra of `m₀`,
- `volume` is not σ-finite with respect to `m`,
- `X - 𝔼[X | m]` is not square-integrable. -/
scoped notation "Var[" f "|" m "]" => Var[f; MeasureTheory.volume | m]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CondVar/Variant775808d4d6af7b7073156647601976c37cdd3e9cd755a30b45133b13d470f19e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CondVar/Variant775808d4d6af7b7073156647601976c37cdd3e9cd755a30b45133b13d470f19e.lean#L40).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f3a2b06e8f7e1b3b4026499c31386f3600dbd7d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
