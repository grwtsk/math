## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:83770860-e730-51fa-87d9-ac1de99a8627`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 193–199.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem powerOnset_ge_first (p : Nat.Primes) (k : ℕ) :
    2*Real.log 2 ≤ powerOnset p k := by
  have hl : Real.log (2:ℝ) ≤ Real.log (p.val:ℝ) :=
    Real.log_le_log (by norm_num) (by exact_mod_cast p.property.two_le)
  have hc : (2:ℝ)≤((k+2:ℕ):ℝ) := by exact_mod_cast (show 2≤k+2 by omega)
  exact mul_le_mul hc hl (Real.log_nonneg (by norm_num)) (by positivity)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ProperPowerTransport/Variantafe2b1399d026f919d642470978f3d6c548cd65a157ecb7099f93ef2046e105e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ProperPowerTransport/Variantafe2b1399d026f919d642470978f3d6c548cd65a157ecb7099f93ef2046e105e.lean#L193).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0837fef432f3e4c3e640a4b5f14d07b6a8ebb1f7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
