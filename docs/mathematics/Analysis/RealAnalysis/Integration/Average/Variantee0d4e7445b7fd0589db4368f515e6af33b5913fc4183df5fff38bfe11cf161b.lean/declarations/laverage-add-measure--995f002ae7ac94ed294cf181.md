## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:476d6289-c2c1-f967-54eb-2f47621c112a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 168–180.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem laverage_add_measure :
    ⨍⁻ x, f x ∂(μ + ν) =
      μ univ / (μ univ + ν univ) * ⨍⁻ x, f x ∂μ + ν univ / (μ univ + ν univ) * ⨍⁻ x, f x ∂ν := by
  by_cases hμ : IsFiniteMeasure μ; swap
  · rw [not_isFiniteMeasure_iff] at hμ
    simp [laverage_eq, hμ]
  by_cases hν : IsFiniteMeasure ν; swap
  · rw [not_isFiniteMeasure_iff] at hν
    simp [laverage_eq, hν]
  haveI := hμ; haveI := hν
  simp only [← ENNReal.mul_div_right_comm, measure_mul_laverage, ← ENNReal.add_div,
    ← lintegral_add_measure, ← Measure.add_apply, ← laverage_eq]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Average/Variantee0d4e7445b7fd0589db4368f515e6af33b5913fc4183df5fff38bfe11cf161b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Average/Variantee0d4e7445b7fd0589db4368f515e6af33b5913fc4183df5fff38bfe11cf161b.lean#L168).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0087a783d7a30e26af5c121caa5aba6a0024dbb2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
