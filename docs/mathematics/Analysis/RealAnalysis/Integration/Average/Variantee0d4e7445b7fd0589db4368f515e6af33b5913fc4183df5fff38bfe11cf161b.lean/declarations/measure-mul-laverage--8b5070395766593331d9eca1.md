## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:90ec5496-e27a-1e30-8e71-c009f2f40892`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 124–129.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measure_mul_laverage [IsFiniteMeasure μ] (f : α → ℝ≥0∞) :
    μ univ * ⨍⁻ x, f x ∂μ = ∫⁻ x, f x ∂μ := by
  rcases eq_or_ne μ 0 with hμ | hμ
  · rw [hμ, lintegral_zero_measure, laverage_zero_measure, mul_zero]
  · rw [laverage_eq, ENNReal.mul_div_cancel (measure_univ_ne_zero.2 hμ) (measure_ne_top _ _)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Average/Variantee0d4e7445b7fd0589db4368f515e6af33b5913fc4183df5fff38bfe11cf161b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Average/Variantee0d4e7445b7fd0589db4368f515e6af33b5913fc4183df5fff38bfe11cf161b.lean#L124).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0087a783d7a30e26af5c121caa5aba6a0024dbb2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
