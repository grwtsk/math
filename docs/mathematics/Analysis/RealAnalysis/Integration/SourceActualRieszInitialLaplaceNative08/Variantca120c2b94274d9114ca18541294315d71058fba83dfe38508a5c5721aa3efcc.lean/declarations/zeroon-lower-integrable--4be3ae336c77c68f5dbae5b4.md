## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:99c49677-6caf-9b2f-707e-fcba7ff115f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 63–68.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem zeroOn_lower_integrable {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E]
    [NormedSpace ℝ E] {f : ℝ → E} {a : ℝ} (hf : ∀ t ∈ Ioc (0 : ℝ) a, f t = 0) :
    IntegrableOn f (Ioc (0 : ℝ) a) := by
  exact (integrableOn_zero : IntegrableOn (fun _ : ℝ => (0 : E)) (Ioc (0 : ℝ) a)).congr_fun
    (fun t ht => (hf t ht).symm) measurableSet_Ioc

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualRieszInitialLaplaceNative08/Variantca120c2b94274d9114ca18541294315d71058fba83dfe38508a5c5721aa3efcc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualRieszInitialLaplaceNative08/Variantca120c2b94274d9114ca18541294315d71058fba83dfe38508a5c5721aa3efcc.lean#L63).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a024efb21b15f6cf7e2f1fcd47edf07514201bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
