## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e7d46958-c918-d7bd-4bac-cadeed573a41`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 404–420.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    IntegrableOn (fun t : ℝ => (actualRieszContinuousRamp t : ℂ) *

  have h0 := integrableOn_exp_mul_complex_Ioi (a := -z) (by simp; linarith) 0
  have hh := integrableOn_exp_mul_complex_Ioi (a := -(z - 1 / 2))
    (by simp; linarith) 0
  have ht : IntegrableOn (fun t : ℝ => (t : ℂ) * Complex.exp (-z * (t : ℂ)))
      (Ioi 0) := by
    apply (actualSingleRieszRamp_integrable (by linarith : 0 < z.re)

    intro t ht
    have htn : 0 ≤ t := (show 0 < t from ht).le

  simp_rw [continuousRamp_weight_eq]
  exact ((hh.const_mul 4).sub (h0.const_mul 4)).sub (ht.const_mul 2)

/-- The continuous ramp keeps its full lower-zero payment in the exact transform. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualRieszInitialLaplaceNative08/Variantca120c2b94274d9114ca18541294315d71058fba83dfe38508a5c5721aa3efcc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualRieszInitialLaplaceNative08/Variantca120c2b94274d9114ca18541294315d71058fba83dfe38508a5c5721aa3efcc.lean#L404).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a024efb21b15f6cf7e2f1fcd47edf07514201bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
