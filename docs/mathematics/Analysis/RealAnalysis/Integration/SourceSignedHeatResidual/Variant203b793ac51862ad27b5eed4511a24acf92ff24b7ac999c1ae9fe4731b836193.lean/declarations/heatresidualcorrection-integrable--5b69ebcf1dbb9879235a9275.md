## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:38f01a26-8f69-c3c4-8ffe-3495ea241426`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 111–119.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem heatResidualCorrection_integrable (hr : Measurable r) (hp : Measurable p)
    (hMr : 0 ≤ Mr) (hMp : 0 ≤ Mp) (hbr : ∀ x, |r x| ≤ Mr)
    (hbp : ∀ x, |p x| ≤ Mp) (τ : ℝ) :
    Integrable (fun x => heatResidualCorrection τ (r x) (p x)) μ := by
  exact (heatRemainderKernel_integrable (r := fun x => r x + p x) (μ := μ)
    (hr.add hp) (add_nonneg hMr hMp)
    (add_bound hbr hbp) τ).sub (heatRemainderKernel_integrable hr hMr hbr τ)

/-- Exact remainder splitting retains the complete mixed nonlinear correction. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceSignedHeatResidual/Variant203b793ac51862ad27b5eed4511a24acf92ff24b7ac999c1ae9fe4731b836193.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceSignedHeatResidual/Variant203b793ac51862ad27b5eed4511a24acf92ff24b7ac999c1ae9fe4731b836193.lean#L111).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `60d96d029b503bb95f4197761dc94058d8dde916` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
