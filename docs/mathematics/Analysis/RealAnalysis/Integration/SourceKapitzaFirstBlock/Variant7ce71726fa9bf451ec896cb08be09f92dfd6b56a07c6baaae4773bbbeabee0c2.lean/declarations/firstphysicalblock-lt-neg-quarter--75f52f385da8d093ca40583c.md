## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7caded5d-f6fb-469f-5e7d-7328573210ed`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 311–316.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem firstPhysicalBlock_lt_neg_quarter (A : ℝ) (hA : 80 ≤ A)
    (hell : ∀ s ∈ Icc (Real.log 2) (Real.log 4), -(1 / 64 : ℝ) ≤ affineTrend A s) :
    firstPhysicalBlock A < -(1 / 4 : ℝ) := by
  linarith [firstPhysicalBlock_upper A hA hell]

/-- Exact uniform affine envelope from genuine endpoint samples, with full real phase. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceKapitzaFirstBlock/Variant7ce71726fa9bf451ec896cb08be09f92dfd6b56a07c6baaae4773bbbeabee0c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceKapitzaFirstBlock/Variant7ce71726fa9bf451ec896cb08be09f92dfd6b56a07c6baaae4773bbbeabee0c2.lean#L311).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1466ed9255cb76417b8d94701a259f187ddc0122` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
