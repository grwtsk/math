## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2190dff8ba4093e010f37a664ab05e9685069cdbf537d1bf93967e9515d7004b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def differencePrimitiveSamplingKernel (A x : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ∑ l ∈ samplingIndices A x, Real.log (l : ℝ) / Real.sqrt (x * (l : ℝ)) *
    (correlationPrimitive A (Real.log (x * (l : ℝ))) -
      sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A (Real.log (x * (l : ℝ))))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/RealThetaDerivativeAudit/Variantfd519c7b2dd9e512426d881a9f46dc063081326b02df9af1e80ca9f2724d3e20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/RealThetaDerivativeAudit/Variantfd519c7b2dd9e512426d881a9f46dc063081326b02df9af1e80ca9f2724d3e20.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `989ec19043f680d216c613841ac5c98df70f39c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
