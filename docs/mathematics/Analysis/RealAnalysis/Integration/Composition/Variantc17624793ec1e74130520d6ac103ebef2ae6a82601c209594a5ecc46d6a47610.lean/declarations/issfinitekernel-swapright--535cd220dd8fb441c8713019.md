## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2e0243f2e831dd7f38980e5bfb38578104da67dadb88bf169345fcd5996143d0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 745–749.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance IsSFiniteKernel.swapRight (κ : kernel α (β × γ)) [IsSFiniteKernel κ] :
    IsSFiniteKernel (swapRight κ) := by rw [swapRight]; infer_instance
#align probability_theory.kernel.is_s_finite_kernel.swap_right ProbabilityTheory.kernel.IsSFiniteKernel.swapRight

/-- Define a `kernel α β` from a `kernel α (β × γ)` by taking the map of the first projection. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Composition/Variantc17624793ec1e74130520d6ac103ebef2ae6a82601c209594a5ecc46d6a47610.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Composition/Variantc17624793ec1e74130520d6ac103ebef2ae6a82601c209594a5ecc46d6a47610.lean#L745).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d4ed952dc3f155e3f9de5f6cf0480a765236331d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
