## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ca12aa71-b426-f812-3add-b6be7531ea7b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–282.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ae_kernel_lt_top (a : α) (h2s : (κ ⊗ₖ η) a s ≠ ∞) :
    ∀ᵐ b ∂κ a, η (a, b) (Prod.mk b ⁻¹' s) < ∞ := by
  let t := toMeasurable ((κ ⊗ₖ η) a) s
  have : ∀ b : β, η (a, b) (Prod.mk b ⁻¹' s) ≤ η (a, b) (Prod.mk b ⁻¹' t) := fun b =>
    measure_mono (Set.preimage_mono (subset_toMeasurable _ _))
  have ht : MeasurableSet t := measurableSet_toMeasurable _ _
  have h2t : (κ ⊗ₖ η) a t ≠ ∞ := by rwa [measure_toMeasurable]
  have ht_lt_top : ∀ᵐ b ∂κ a, η (a, b) (Prod.mk b ⁻¹' t) < ∞ := by

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Composition/Variantc17624793ec1e74130520d6ac103ebef2ae6a82601c209594a5ecc46d6a47610.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Composition/Variantc17624793ec1e74130520d6ac103ebef2ae6a82601c209594a5ecc46d6a47610.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d4ed952dc3f155e3f9de5f6cf0480a765236331d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
