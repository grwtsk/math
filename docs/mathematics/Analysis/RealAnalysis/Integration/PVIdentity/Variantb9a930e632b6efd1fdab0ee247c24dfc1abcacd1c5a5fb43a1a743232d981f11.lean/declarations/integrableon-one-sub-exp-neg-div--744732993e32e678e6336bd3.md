## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ae0dcd90-454e-a451-dfaa-4f90e0d1e4c7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    IntegrableOn (fun t => (1 - exp (-t)) / t) (Ioc 0 1) := by
  -- We'll use the fact that \( \frac{1 - e^{-t}}{t} \) is bounded above by 1 on the interval (0, 1].
  have h_bound : ∀ t ∈ Set.Ioc 0 1, (1 - Real.exp (-t)) / t ≤ 1 := by
    exact fun t ht => by rw [ div_le_iff₀ ht.1 ] ; linarith [ Real.add_one_le_exp ( -t ) ] ;

/-
PROBLEM
The function exp(-t)/t is integrable on (1, ∞)
PROVIDED SOLUTION
exp(-t)/t ≤ exp(-t) for t ≥ 1, and exp(-t) is integrable on (1,∞). Use Integrable.mono' with exp(-t) as the bound.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PVIdentity/Variantb9a930e632b6efd1fdab0ee247c24dfc1abcacd1c5a5fb43a1a743232d981f11.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PVIdentity/Variantb9a930e632b6efd1fdab0ee247c24dfc1abcacd1c5a5fb43a1a743232d981f11.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `de357c34051029ec1e785dacf601e32497997d99` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
