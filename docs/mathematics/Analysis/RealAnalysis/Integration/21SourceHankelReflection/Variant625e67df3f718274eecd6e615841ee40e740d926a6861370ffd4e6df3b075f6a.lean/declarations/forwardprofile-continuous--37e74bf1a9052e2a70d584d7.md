## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fa555070-839d-0085-1111-6ee4b61598c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–81.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem forwardProfile_continuous {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) (s : Finset ℕ) (c : ℕ → ℝ) :
    Continuous (forwardProfile A s c) := by
  unfold forwardProfile
  exact continuous_finsetSum s (fun m _ ↦ continuous_const.mul
    ((normalizedTest_contDiff A hA).continuous.comp (continuous_id.sub continuous_const)))

/-- Finite reflected profiles retain the actual global continuity. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/21SourceHankelReflection/Variant625e67df3f718274eecd6e615841ee40e740d926a6861370ffd4e6df3b075f6a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/21SourceHankelReflection/Variant625e67df3f718274eecd6e615841ee40e740d926a6861370ffd4e6df3b075f6a.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b64b12c796ba744dddee71eeb1c573d6203a9633` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
