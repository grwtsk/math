## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9dbd7934-1d45-42c0-2f12-10dd7f19c905`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–274.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mul_continuousOn {f g : ℝ → A} (hf : IntervalIntegrable f μ a b)
    (hg : ContinuousOn g [[a, b]]) : IntervalIntegrable (fun x => f x * g x) μ a b := by
  rw [intervalIntegrable_iff] at hf ⊢
  exact hf.mul_continuousOn_of_subset hg measurableSet_Ioc isCompact_uIcc Ioc_subset_Icc_self
#align interval_integrable.mul_continuous_on IntervalIntegrable.mul_continuousOn

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/IntervalIntegral/Variant16ba8c4df89b64578a785e20b9bd4b7eac995412b3fac3de3d9015b88122934b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/IntervalIntegral/Variant16ba8c4df89b64578a785e20b9bd4b7eac995412b3fac3de3d9015b88122934b.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1ae36b1e8d39aa18e52042b54d92c73a6275ad51` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
