## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b0f88eb4-b91d-a3fd-2750-3bf056f0978b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 180–191.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem of_measure_le {μ' : Measure α} (h : μ ≤ μ') (hT : DominatedFinMeasAdditive μ T C)
    (hC : 0 ≤ C) : DominatedFinMeasAdditive μ' T C := by
  have h' : ∀ s, μ s = ∞ → μ' s = ∞ := fun s hs ↦ top_unique <| hs.symm.trans_le (h _)
  refine ⟨hT.1.of_eq_top_imp_eq_top fun s _ ↦ h' s, fun s hs hμ's ↦ ?_⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FinMeasAdditive/Variantac21a607342c3f3ba876fde07de5372a4849d269d2d12af6f2c5d7a987b0cc69.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FinMeasAdditive/Variantac21a607342c3f3ba876fde07de5372a4849d269d2d12af6f2c5d7a987b0cc69.lean#L180).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2c0e5a2816a1941dca32317ed28b4d194f5fa166` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
