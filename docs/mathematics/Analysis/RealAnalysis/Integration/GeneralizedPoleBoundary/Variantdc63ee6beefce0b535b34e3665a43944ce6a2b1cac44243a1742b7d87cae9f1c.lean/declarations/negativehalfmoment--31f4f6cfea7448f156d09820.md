## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:24c8a574609fdc471ac1255af4210fece8bdad8bcd6d2e1b95a96d81e9f6932e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 28–31.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def negativeHalfMoment (A : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ∫ t in 0..2 * A, t * Real.exp (-t / 2) * sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A t

/-- The integrable nonnegative dominating weight on the positive half-line. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/GeneralizedPoleBoundary/Variantdc63ee6beefce0b535b34e3665a43944ce6a2b1cac44243a1742b7d87cae9f1c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/GeneralizedPoleBoundary/Variantdc63ee6beefce0b535b34e3665a43944ce6a2b1cac44243a1742b7d87cae9f1c.lean#L28).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cb6b5bb3372eb1b9a48cf536c528e2c416090e36` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
