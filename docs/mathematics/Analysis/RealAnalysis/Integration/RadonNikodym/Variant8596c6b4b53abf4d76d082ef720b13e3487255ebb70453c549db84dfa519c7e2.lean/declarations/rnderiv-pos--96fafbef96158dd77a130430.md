## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:681d02b8-14a1-a71e-5f8e-45dd6d5c76b2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–84.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma rnDeriv_pos [HaveLebesgueDecomposition μ ν] (hμν : μ ≪ ν) :
    ∀ᵐ x ∂μ, 0 < μ.rnDeriv ν x := by
  rw [← Measure.withDensity_rnDeriv_eq _ _  hμν,
    ae_withDensity_iff (Measure.measurable_rnDeriv _ _), Measure.withDensity_rnDeriv_eq _ _  hμν]
  exact ae_of_all _ (fun x hx ↦ lt_of_le_of_ne (zero_le _) hx.symm)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/RadonNikodym/Variant8596c6b4b53abf4d76d082ef720b13e3487255ebb70453c549db84dfa519c7e2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/RadonNikodym/Variant8596c6b4b53abf4d76d082ef720b13e3487255ebb70453c549db84dfa519c7e2.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7a7afe00c8f7753447f562646bf58cdaa74226f8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
