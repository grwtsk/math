## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0ae5fb6f-914c-2551-4d8b-e824ad9c534b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem withDensity_rnDeriv_eq (μ ν : Measure α) [HaveLebesgueDecomposition μ ν] (h : μ ≪ ν) :
    ν.withDensity (rnDeriv μ ν) = μ := by
  suffices μ.singularPart ν = 0 by
    conv_rhs => rw [haveLebesgueDecomposition_add μ ν, this, zero_add]
  exact (singularPart_eq_zero μ ν).mpr h

variable {μ ν : Measure α}

/-- **The Radon-Nikodym theorem**: Given two measures `μ` and `ν`, if
`HaveLebesgueDecomposition μ ν`, then `μ` is absolutely continuous to `ν` if and only if
`ν.withDensity (rnDeriv μ ν) = μ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/RadonNikodym/Variantc8a01d75315bbbc0ead8f74f82e6b37af9afe04d7b111cf6022bf09e5d29d298.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/RadonNikodym/Variantc8a01d75315bbbc0ead8f74f82e6b37af9afe04d7b111cf6022bf09e5d29d298.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c50833bfaa6e687c60f20bd9988efbca68ccb762` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
