## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:035ee1d0-8a1f-032e-1ab9-0eb77e0c76f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 743–750.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma DeltaSpikeNonNeg_of_NonNeg {ν : ℝ → ℝ} (νnonneg : ∀ x > 0, 0 ≤ ν x)
     {x ε : ℝ} (xpos : 0 < x) (εpos : 0 < ε) :
    0 ≤ DeltaSpike ν ε x := by
  dsimp [DeltaSpike]
  have : 0 < x ^ (1 / ε) := by positivity
  have : 0 ≤ ν (x ^ (1 / ε)) := νnonneg _ this
  positivity

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Zeta23FromPNTPlusMellinCalculusCurrent/Variant5e6ecfcb91c5bf1982748dee26cf7fe1226a91dd2fa8a8457b115144b2320ee6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Zeta23FromPNTPlusMellinCalculusCurrent/Variant5e6ecfcb91c5bf1982748dee26cf7fe1226a91dd2fa8a8457b115144b2320ee6.lean#L743).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fe0aad58186aa1be22aa6f6c63491354d123fa9c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
