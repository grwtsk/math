## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:48b4f0db-0563-5897-9a5c-31736fd0f835`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 105–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma integral_condKernel (a : α) (hf : Integrable f (κ a)) :
    ∫ b, ∫ ω, f (b, ω) ∂(Kernel.condKernel κ (a, b)) ∂(Kernel.fst κ a) = ∫ x, f x ∂(κ a) := by
  conv_rhs => rw [← κ.disintegrate κ.condKernel]
  rw [← κ.disintegrate κ.condKernel] at hf
  rw [integral_compProd hf]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integral/Variant10fd31c4064cb895e2483f30cd269137128c8f1b0e2333cdaa9d2a9df8782bcf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integral/Variant10fd31c4064cb895e2483f30cd269137128c8f1b0e2333cdaa9d2a9df8782bcf.lean#L105).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dfe92dbc1261cdcb5b6b96c43d6bfbcfbd97c11d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
