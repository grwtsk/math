## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:127623f6-cc5f-fb17-56be-ef56efe5ce79`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–98.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integral_comp_neg_Iic {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E]
    (c : ℝ) (f : ℝ → E) : (∫ x in Iic c, f (-x)) = ∫ x in Ioi (-c), f x := by
  have A : MeasurableEmbedding fun x : ℝ => -x :=
    (Homeomorph.neg ℝ).isClosedEmbedding.measurableEmbedding
  have := MeasurableEmbedding.setIntegral_map (μ := volume) A f (Ici (-c))
  rw [Measure.map_neg_eq_self (volume : Measure ℝ)] at this
  simp_rw [← integral_Ici_eq_integral_Ioi, this, neg_preimage, neg_Ici, neg_neg]

/- @[simp] Porting note: Linter complains it does not apply to itself. Although it does apply to
itself, it does not apply when `f` is more complicated -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integral/Variantbbeccf2b80c350194b0bb8c6c2c05f4a812b8005b8c37bbb5ff0408ad0549da9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integral/Variantbbeccf2b80c350194b0bb8c6c2c05f4a812b8005b8c37bbb5ff0408ad0549da9.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e8a96a15d2dbf54e3853a6ed98e74f2c268a42fc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
