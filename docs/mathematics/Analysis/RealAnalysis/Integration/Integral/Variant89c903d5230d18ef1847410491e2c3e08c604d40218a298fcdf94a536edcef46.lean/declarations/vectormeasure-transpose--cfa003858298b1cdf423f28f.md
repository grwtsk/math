## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:27d19e12fcf008b4a9bb5aa324b5accbbd4d1a22c9c79893911c772d41969184`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 82–88.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def VectorMeasure.transpose (μ : VectorMeasure X F) (B : E →L[ℝ] F →L[ℝ] G) :
    VectorMeasure X (E →L[ℝ] G) := μ.mapRange B.flip.toAddMonoidHom B.flip.continuous

/-- Given a set `s`, return the continuous linear map `fun x : E ↦ B x (μ s)` (actually defined
using `transpose` through `mapRange`), where the `B` is a `G`-valued bilinear form on `E × F` and
`μ` is an `F`-valued vector measure. The extension of that set function through `setToFun` gives the
pairing integral of `E`-valued integrable functions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integral/Variant89c903d5230d18ef1847410491e2c3e08c604d40218a298fcdf94a536edcef46.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integral/Variant89c903d5230d18ef1847410491e2c3e08c604d40218a298fcdf94a536edcef46.lean#L82).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4cd6d51dc28138c2a2aa05ca63204735a9a5c22` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
