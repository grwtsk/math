## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1c567ec8-d6a0-3a3d-6342-d81e68e4ab4e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 166–173.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem upperSmallSum_measurable (N : ℕ) : Measurable (upperSmallSum N) := by
  unfold upperSmallSum upperSmallIndices
  simp_rw [sum_filter]
  apply Finset.measurable_sum
  intro i _
  exact measurable_const.piecewise measurableSet_Ici measurable_const

/-- A finite absolute-weight bound is used only to establish genuine integrability. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/UpperBoundaryHyperbola/Variant99b8bb1c1acc2ba11d2627afdf52167863244c9d86a02c096db448b8c63f6615.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/UpperBoundaryHyperbola/Variant99b8bb1c1acc2ba11d2627afdf52167863244c9d86a02c096db448b8c63f6615.lean#L166).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9828b34de7f2f3b8c0121a9a50a1c208474ff83d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
