## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dfff12a9-2f46-c937-cb26-ec13db076203`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–50.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

private theorem physical_profile_measurable {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) :
    Measurable (fun p : ℝ × ℝ => actualPeriodicPhysicalCellProfile A p.1 p.2) := by
  have hc := actual_correlation_contDiff_four A hA
  have h1 : ContDiff ℝ 1 (iteratedDeriv 1 (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A)) := by
    rw [iteratedDeriv_eq_iterate]
    exact ContDiff.iterate_deriv' 1 1 (hc.of_le (by norm_num))
  have h3 : ContDiff ℝ 1 (iteratedDeriv 3 (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A)) := by
    rw [iteratedDeriv_eq_iterate]
    exact ContDiff.iterate_deriv' 1 3 (hc.of_le (by norm_num))
  have hm1 := h1.continuous.measurable
  have hm3 := h3.continuous.measurable

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Attempt06/Varianta309f620c935c20455aebea48bd6ba13a4d380b7d16955e5ee208cad2b48e91c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Attempt06/Varianta309f620c935c20455aebea48bd6ba13a4d380b7d16955e5ee208cad2b48e91c.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ad27d873ad1b8bbf9a032db4ba1a16ea01d4690f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
