## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:163b2861af125459480a19389b9c88eb64c69197636d6ff8e877a8beb955c9d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 161–171.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class HasOuterApproxClosed (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] : Prop where
  exAppr : ∀ (F : Set X), IsClosed F → ∃ (fseq : ℕ → (X →ᵇ ℝ≥0)),
    (∀ n x, fseq n x ≤ 1) ∧ (∀ n x, x ∈ F → 1 ≤ fseq n x) ∧
    Tendsto (fun n : ℕ ↦ (fun x ↦ fseq n x)) atTop (𝓝 (indicator F fun _ ↦ (1 : ℝ≥0)))

namespace HasOuterApproxClosed

variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] [HasOuterApproxClosed X]
variable {F : Set X} (hF : IsClosed F)

/-- A sequence of continuous functions `X → [0,1]` tending to the indicator of a closed set. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/HasOuterApproxClosed/Variant58faf38cf5f8aa4ef3b6418526fb09ce23372ffe6560b85f936113ff284a1c27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/HasOuterApproxClosed/Variant58faf38cf5f8aa4ef3b6418526fb09ce23372ffe6560b85f936113ff284a1c27.lean#L161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `24acba94dd117c99ad39f86567ead16935981d85` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
