## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:429ed5ac-7ba2-7d5f-8968-979ffae8cb97`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–75.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actual_transformed_kernel_negative {A y : ℝ} (hA : 40 ≤ A)
    (hy : (13 / 2 : ℝ) ≤ y) (hy7 : y ≤ 7) :
    deriv (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A) (Real.log y) -

  have hp : 0 < A := by linarith

  have hl0 : 0 ≤ Real.log y := Real.log_nonneg (by linarith)

  have hc := sourceCorrelation_sub_one_abs_le hA1 (Real.log y)
  rw [abs_of_nonneg hl0] at hc
  have hbound : 5 * Real.log y / A ≤ (1 / 4 : ℝ) :=
    (div_le_iff₀ hp).mpr (by linarith)
  have hcl : (3 / 4 : ℝ) ≤ sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A (Real.log y) := by
    linarith [(abs_le.mp hc).1]
  have hd := sourceCorrelation_deriv_abs_le_five_div hA1 (Real.log y)
  have hdb : 5 / A ≤ (1 / 8 : ℝ) := (div_le_iff₀ hp).mpr (by linarith)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualXiPositiveBlock/Variant5ce94f470a91c107c1d8612d777fd7ce009835a5eab3fae5dc21629f609360bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualXiPositiveBlock/Variant5ce94f470a91c107c1d8612d777fd7ce009835a5eab3fae5dc21629f609360bd.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `af5f6d9d902393e8c32464af92db7956bd1c066b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
