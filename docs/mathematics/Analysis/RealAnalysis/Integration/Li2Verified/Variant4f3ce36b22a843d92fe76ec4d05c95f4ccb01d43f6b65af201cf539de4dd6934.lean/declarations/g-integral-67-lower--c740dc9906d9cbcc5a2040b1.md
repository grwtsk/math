## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:146aa8f2-5ac1-9d64-ea1d-d78bed851b2a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 810–847.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! ### Main Theorem: Verified li(2) Bounds -/

/-- The main verified theorem: certified bounds on li(2).

This proves the same bounds as `Li2.li2_lower` and `Li2.li2_upper` in Li2Bounds.lean,
but with full numerical verification via interval arithmetic.

The `sorry`s in Li2Bounds.lean are deliberate - they allow downstream projects to use
the bounds without the ~20 minute compilation cost. This file provides the actual
verification that those bounds are correct. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Li2Verified/Variant4f3ce36b22a843d92fe76ec4d05c95f4ccb01d43f6b65af201cf539de4dd6934.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Li2Verified/Variant4f3ce36b22a843d92fe76ec4d05c95f4ccb01d43f6b65af201cf539de4dd6934.lean#L810).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
