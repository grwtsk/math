## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:82e6fec2-4e94-a5c6-83a5-da0c05e6fce4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 522–528.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Integrable.integral_norm_condKernel {f : α × Ω → F} (hf_int : Integrable f ρ) :
    Integrable (fun x => ∫ y, ‖f (x, y)‖ ∂ρ.condKernel x) ρ.fst := by
  have hf_ae : AEStronglyMeasurable f ρ := hf_int.1
  rw [← hf_ae.ae_integrable_condKernel_iff] at hf_int
  exact hf_int.2
#align measure_theory.integrable.integral_norm_cond_kernel MeasureTheory.Integrable.integral_norm_condKernel

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Disintegration/Variantc58b5a90a271919c6eb0940e62c8ca49a4b8916ee8326841fbcb8628b9ff1754.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Disintegration/Variantc58b5a90a271919c6eb0940e62c8ca49a4b8916ee8326841fbcb8628b9ff1754.lean#L522).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ba43ee13e0b7da787fe27cb685b7a531403c97ef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
