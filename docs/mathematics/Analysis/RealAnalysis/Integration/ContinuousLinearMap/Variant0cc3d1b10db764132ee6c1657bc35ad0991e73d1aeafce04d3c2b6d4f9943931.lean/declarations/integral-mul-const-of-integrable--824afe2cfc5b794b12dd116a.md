## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:843f43e7-2cdc-ef4b-6520-dbfa9e29b39d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 249–257.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma integral_mul_const_of_integrable {A : Type*} [NonUnitalNormedRing A] [NormedSpace ℝ A]
    [IsScalarTower ℝ A A] [SMulCommClass ℝ A A] {f : X → A} (hf : Integrable f μ) {c : A} :

  by_cases hA : CompleteSpace A
  · change ∫ x, (ContinuousLinearMap.mul ℝ _).flip c (f x) ∂μ
      = (ContinuousLinearMap.mul ℝ _).flip c (∫ x, f x ∂μ)

  · simp [integral, hA]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ContinuousLinearMap/Variant0cc3d1b10db764132ee6c1657bc35ad0991e73d1aeafce04d3c2b6d4f9943931.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ContinuousLinearMap/Variant0cc3d1b10db764132ee6c1657bc35ad0991e73d1aeafce04d3c2b6d4f9943931.lean#L249).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7d4329a27a93834efbde87a6f8dd5bc6d0db8d35` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
