## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c21eacb4-02de-26f4-7852-fcfd894280c5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 16–24.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integral_exp_jacobian (g : ℝ → ℝ) :
    (∫ x, g x ∂positiveMeasure) = ∫ u, Real.exp u * g (Real.exp u) := by
  have h := integral_image_eq_integral_abs_deriv_smul
    (s:=univ) measurableSet_univ
    (fun u _ => (Real.hasDerivAt_exp u).hasDerivWithinAt)
    Real.exp_injective.injOn g
  simpa only [image_univ,Real.range_exp,abs_of_pos (Real.exp_pos _),
    smul_eq_mul,Measure.restrict_univ,positiveMeasure] using h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LogCoordinateAttempt01/Variantd18e8dae269c52559d9b19f126b50941da2a9c72aaa3783b5dc693b284f15d7c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LogCoordinateAttempt01/Variantd18e8dae269c52559d9b19f126b50941da2a9c72aaa3783b5dc693b284f15d7c.lean#L16).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27136e64cdfd79db6ad26b30882e0b16b780552f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
