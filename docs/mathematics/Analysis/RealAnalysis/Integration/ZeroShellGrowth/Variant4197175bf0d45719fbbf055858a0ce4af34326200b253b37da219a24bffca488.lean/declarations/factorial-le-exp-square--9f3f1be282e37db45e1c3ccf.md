## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a8d7355c-6f1c-8729-4eca-e287e852f93d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–60.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma factorial_le_exp_square (m : ℕ) : (m.factorial : ℝ) ≤ Real.exp ((m : ℝ)^2) := by
  have hp : (m.factorial : ℝ) ≤ (m : ℝ)^m := by exact_mod_cast Nat.factorial_le_pow m
  have he : (m : ℝ) ≤ Real.exp (m : ℝ) := le_trans (by linarith) (Real.add_one_le_exp (m : ℝ))
  calc
    _ ≤ (m : ℝ)^m := hp
    _ ≤ (Real.exp (m : ℝ))^m := pow_le_pow_left₀ (by positivity) he m
    _ = Real.exp ((m : ℝ)^2) := by rw [← Real.exp_nat_mul]; congr 1; ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ZeroShellGrowth/Variant4197175bf0d45719fbbf055858a0ce4af34326200b253b37da219a24bffca488.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ZeroShellGrowth/Variant4197175bf0d45719fbbf055858a0ce4af34326200b253b37da219a24bffca488.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9b547779ccc46302c9bef9001c780286c9072981` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
