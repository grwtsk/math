## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:82870583-eb19-bedf-e73e-da17c9de86fe`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 300–321.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- The layer cake formula / Cavalieri's principle / tail probability formula:

Let `f` be a non-negative measurable function on a sigma-finite measure space. Let `G` be an
increasing absolutely continuous function on the positive real line, vanishing at the origin,
with derivative `G' = g`. Then the integral of the composition `G ∘ f` can be written as
the integral over the positive real line of the "tail measures" `μ {ω | f(ω) > t}` of `f`
weighted by `g`.

Roughly speaking, the statement is: `∫⁻ (G ∘ f) ∂μ = ∫⁻ t in (0).. ∞, g(t) * μ {ω | f(ω) > t}`.

See `lintegral_comp_eq_lintegral_meas_le_mul` for a version with sets of the form `{ω | f(ω) ≥ t}`
instead. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Layercake/Variantad25df64f335e5661d59943f94c45f132f754d293b10204aecdf812714461475.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Layercake/Variantad25df64f335e5661d59943f94c45f132f754d293b10204aecdf812714461475.lean#L300).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c9aeb10ce211de0ececd83a30212e61be39f0b41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
