## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1800caee-e8d1-039b-f40a-400cc25ce95f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 268–277.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem omitted_prime_two_boundary_is_nonzero :
    chebyshevError (Real.exp lowerEndpoint) -
      (∑ n ∈ primePowerInventory lowerEndpoint, ArithmeticFunction.vonMangoldt n) = -2 := by
  rw [chebyshevError]
  change chebyshevPrimePower (Real.exp lowerEndpoint) - Real.exp lowerEndpoint -
    chebyshevPrimePower (Real.exp lowerEndpoint) = -2
  rw [lowerEndpoint, Real.exp_log (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) < 2)]
  ring

/-- The exponential test agrees exactly with the manuscript's inverse square-root weight. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PrimePowerDescent/Variant03dc9e23ff3b92d187154e757c552f64a2ae25e503061ba9bcb264034c7f64dc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PrimePowerDescent/Variant03dc9e23ff3b92d187154e757c552f64a2ae25e503061ba9bcb264034c7f64dc.lean#L268).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b4174728642f2a3265b1e27be9f7854589bfa9f9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
