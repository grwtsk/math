## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:762dbeda-99f7-3bb5-ef6b-7af82aa056e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 278–285.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exponentialTest_log (C : ℝ → ℝ) (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
    exponentialTest C (Real.log n) = C (Real.log n) / Real.sqrt n := by
  have hn' : (0 : ℝ) < n := by exact_mod_cast hn
  rw [exponentialTest, neg_div, Real.exp_neg, Real.exp_half, Real.exp_log hn']
  ring

/-- A strict source cutoff is equivalent to the closed inventory only when the
right-endpoint correlation is zero. Prime-power atoms there are accounted for. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PrimePowerDescent/Variant1726be4e0c2451b41baaa576182329d5b5297b86a6720c09f82fd0b341ae0f81.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PrimePowerDescent/Variant1726be4e0c2451b41baaa576182329d5b5297b86a6720c09f82fd0b341ae0f81.lean#L278).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a91d1da973c2c5f8d4fcac7ee8fee07fad01995` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
