## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7e9c9a6ca0eb0756fa3e195b96b31c4f4495e4fee00fba873106845dba197c2c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 110–119.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def needleProjX (x θ : ℝ) : Set ℝ := Set.Icc (x - θ.sin * l / 2) (x + θ.sin * l / 2)

/--
The indicator function of whether a needle at position `⟨x, θ⟩ : ℝ × ℝ` crosses the line `x = 0`.

In order to faithfully model the problem, we compose `needleCrossesIndicator` with a random
variable `B : Ω → ℝ × ℝ` with uniform distribution on `[-d/2, d/2] × [0, π]`. Then, by symmetry,
the probability that the needle crosses `x = 0`, is the same as the probability of a needle
crossing any of the infinitely spaced vertical lines distance `d` apart.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/BuffonsNeedle/Variant58f2268e574605b5499d84737d25f36d5bee4003293d637024e2bd502d726597.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/BuffonsNeedle/Variant58f2268e574605b5499d84737d25f36d5bee4003293d637024e2bd502d726597.lean#L110).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fe9baacf97ee30ac3569acac2c24a825bd1f409f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
