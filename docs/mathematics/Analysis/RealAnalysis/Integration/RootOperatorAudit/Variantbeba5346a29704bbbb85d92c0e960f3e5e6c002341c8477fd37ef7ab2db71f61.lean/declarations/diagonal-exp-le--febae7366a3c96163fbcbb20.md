## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3d6c943d-d479-28d7-fbe2-188b2d91c136`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 437–446.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem diagonal_exp_le (α : ℝ) (hα : 0 < α) :
    Real.exp ((1 - diagonalCutoff α) / 2) ≤ α ^ 2 := by
  have hN : 1 + 4 * Real.log (1 / α) ≤ diagonalCutoff α := le_max_right _ _
  calc
    _ ≤ Real.exp (-2 * Real.log (1 / α)) := Real.exp_le_exp.mpr (by linarith)
    _ = α ^ 2 := by
      rw [one_div, Real.log_inv]
      have he : -2 * -Real.log α = (2 : ℕ) * Real.log α := by norm_num
      rw [he, Real.exp_nat_mul, Real.exp_log hα]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/RootOperatorAudit/Variantbeba5346a29704bbbb85d92c0e960f3e5e6c002341c8477fd37ef7ab2db71f61.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/RootOperatorAudit/Variantbeba5346a29704bbbb85d92c0e960f3e5e6c002341c8477fd37ef7ab2db71f61.lean#L437).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f1698e38e0c95e188893914c51ecb49291de86ac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
