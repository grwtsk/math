## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b672c5f5-326a-4835-f8f9-fa4f6d4bc08b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem source_tsupport_subset {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) :
    tsupport (normalizedTest explicitSecondDerivative A) ⊆ Icc (-A) A := by
  apply closure_minimal _ isClosed_Icc
  intro x hx
  by_contra hnot
  have habs : A ≤ |x| := by
    by_cases hleft : -A ≤ x
    · have hright : A < x := lt_of_not_ge (fun h => hnot ⟨hleft, h⟩)
      exact hright.le.trans (le_abs_self x)
    · have hleft' : x < -A := lt_of_not_ge hleft
      have h := neg_le_abs x
      linarith
  exact hx (normalizedTest_zero_of_le_abs A x hA habs)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualMixedWorkFubini/Variantfef4057a4160f1f9e366f0bf7dc43d7b94eb50cfbbda37960c7c52013cd63e8f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualMixedWorkFubini/Variantfef4057a4160f1f9e366f0bf7dc43d7b94eb50cfbbda37960c7c52013cd63e8f.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `79eb81386480ae77cd5b4f82b5d72655b02ad983` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
