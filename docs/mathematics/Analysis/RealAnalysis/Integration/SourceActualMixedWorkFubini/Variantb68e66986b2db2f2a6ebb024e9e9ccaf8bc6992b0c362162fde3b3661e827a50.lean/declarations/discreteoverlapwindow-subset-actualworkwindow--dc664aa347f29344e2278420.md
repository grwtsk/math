## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:28ef0fbe-a035-7aa7-7f29-df3328253d1c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 828–838.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem discreteOverlapWindow_subset_actualWorkWindow (A : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    discreteOverlapWindow A ⊆ actualWorkWindow A := by
  have hU : 0 < (vaughanCutoff A : ℝ) := by
    exact_mod_cast (by have := vaughanCutoff_pos A hA; omega : 0 < vaughanCutoff A)
  have hlog : Real.log (vaughanCutoff A : ℝ) ≤
      Real.log ((vaughanCutoff A + 1 : ℕ) : ℝ) :=

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualMixedWorkFubini/Variantb68e66986b2db2f2a6ebb024e9e9ccaf8bc6992b0c362162fde3b3661e827a50.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualMixedWorkFubini/Variantb68e66986b2db2f2a6ebb024e9e9ccaf8bc6992b0c362162fde3b3661e827a50.lean#L828).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ddaa0a38d43ccfbc3c3f8645035c2fcbc6f007fd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
