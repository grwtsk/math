## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4bf5de0e24b08fdd00ed5be1dd2d3748f7106aaf439bf7a1949dd7610ad1cec7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 326–342.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def measurableSpace (hτ : IsStoppingTime f τ) : MeasurableSpace Ω where
  MeasurableSet' s := ∀ i : ι, MeasurableSet[f i] (s ∩ {ω | τ ω ≤ i})
  measurableSet_empty i := (Set.empty_inter {ω | τ ω ≤ i}).symm ▸ @MeasurableSet.empty _ (f i)
  measurableSet_compl s hs i := by
    rw [(_ : sᶜ ∩ {ω | τ ω ≤ i} = (sᶜ ∪ {ω | τ ω ≤ i}ᶜ) ∩ {ω | τ ω ≤ i})]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Stopping/Varianta3c6973d1a4ff0866e5f022454cf0e47f6db4e7eb1682595502e727ebd59a57d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Stopping/Varianta3c6973d1a4ff0866e5f022454cf0e47f6db4e7eb1682595502e727ebd59a57d.lean#L326).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9c891612ada35af032e0a56a86b684e7c548ecf1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
