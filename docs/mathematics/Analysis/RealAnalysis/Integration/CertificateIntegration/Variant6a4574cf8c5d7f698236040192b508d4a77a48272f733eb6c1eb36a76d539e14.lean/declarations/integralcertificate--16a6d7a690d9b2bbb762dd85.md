## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b11596710fb4aa44efa24feeea20920a2e8bb1ab60cb9095271295cbc352c4c5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure IntegralCertificate where
  /-- The expression being integrated -/
  expr_id : String  -- For documentation/debugging only
  /-- The overall integration domain [a, b] -/
  domain : IntervalRat
  /-- List of partition entries -/
  partitions : List PartitionEntry
  deriving Repr

/-! ### Certificate Verification (Linear Checker)

These functions are what the kernel actually executes.
They are purely linear - no recursion, no branching on computed values.

/-- Check that partition domains cover [a, b] contiguously.
    Returns true iff domains are [a, t₁], [t₁, t₂], ..., [tₙ₋₁, b] -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CertificateIntegration/Variant6a4574cf8c5d7f698236040192b508d4a77a48272f733eb6c1eb36a76d539e14.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CertificateIntegration/Variant6a4574cf8c5d7f698236040192b508d4a77a48272f733eb6c1eb36a76d539e14.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `335e39587dbaa85521f4e8fc941808c68eeeb679` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
