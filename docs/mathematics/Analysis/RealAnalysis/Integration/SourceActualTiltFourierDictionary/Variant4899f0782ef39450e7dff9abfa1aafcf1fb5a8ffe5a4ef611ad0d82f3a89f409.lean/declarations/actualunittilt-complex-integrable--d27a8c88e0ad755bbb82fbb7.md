## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:09f523f4-8896-e6ff-be16-2d6b248d2f91`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 36–46.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actualUnitTilt_complex_integrable {A : ℝ} (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    Integrable (fun x => (actualUnitTilt A x : ℂ)) volume := by
  have hp : 0 < A := by linarith
  have hc : Continuous (actualUnitTilt A) :=
    (normalizedTest_contDiff A hp).continuous.mul Real.continuous_exp
  have hs : HasCompactSupport (actualUnitTilt A) :=
    (normalizedTest_hasCompactSupport A hp).mul_right
  exact (Complex.continuous_ofReal.comp hc).integrable_of_hasCompactSupport
    (hs.comp_left (g := Complex.ofReal) (by simp))

/-- The equivalence class has the same genuine whole-line L1 prerequisite. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualTiltFourierDictionary/Variant4899f0782ef39450e7dff9abfa1aafcf1fb5a8ffe5a4ef611ad0d82f3a89f409.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualTiltFourierDictionary/Variant4899f0782ef39450e7dff9abfa1aafcf1fb5a8ffe5a4ef611ad0d82f3a89f409.lean#L36).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b5be69788f3334c803f68d674d6917bfbb508463` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
