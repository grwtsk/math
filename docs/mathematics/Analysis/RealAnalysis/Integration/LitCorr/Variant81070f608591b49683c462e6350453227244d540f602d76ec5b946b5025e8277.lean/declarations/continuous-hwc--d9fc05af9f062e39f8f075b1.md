## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6343acf1-37a3-a443-b5c1-d7007b2ab023`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 158–168.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem continuous_HwC {c : ℝ} {k : ℝ → ℂ} (hk : ContDiff ℝ 2 k) (hkc : HasCompactSupport k) :
    Continuous (HwC c k) := by
  have h1 := continuous_Hfn_line hk hkc c
  have h2 := continuous_Hfn_line hk hkc (1 - c)
  have h2' : Continuous (fun t : ℝ => Hfn k (1 - (c:ℂ) - t * I)) := by
    have : (fun t : ℝ => Hfn k (1 - (c:ℂ) - t * I))
        = (fun t : ℝ => Hfn k (((1 - c : ℝ) : ℂ) + t * I)) ∘ fun t : ℝ => -t := by
      funext t; simp only [Function.comp]; congr 1; push_cast; ring
    rw [this]; exact h2.comp continuous_neg
  exact h1.add h2'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LitCorr/Variant81070f608591b49683c462e6350453227244d540f602d76ec5b946b5025e8277.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LitCorr/Variant81070f608591b49683c462e6350453227244d540f602d76ec5b946b5025e8277.lean#L158).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5994379f36207f5dde75c32a242c74443f519d79` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
