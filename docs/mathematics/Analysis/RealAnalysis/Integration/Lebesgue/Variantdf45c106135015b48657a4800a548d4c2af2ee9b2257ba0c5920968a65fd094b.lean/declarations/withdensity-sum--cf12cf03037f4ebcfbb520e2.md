## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:640acfa4-e79e-ad1e-3c80-17ca933d0b01`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1576–1581.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem withDensity_sum {ι : Type*} {m : MeasurableSpace α} (μ : ι → Measure α) (f : α → ℝ≥0∞) :
    (sum μ).withDensity f = sum fun n => (μ n).withDensity f := by
  ext1 s hs
  simp_rw [sum_apply _ hs, withDensity_apply f hs, restrict_sum μ hs, lintegral_sum_measure]
#align measure_theory.with_density_sum MeasureTheory.withDensity_sum

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Lebesgue/Variantdf45c106135015b48657a4800a548d4c2af2ee9b2257ba0c5920968a65fd094b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Lebesgue/Variantdf45c106135015b48657a4800a548d4c2af2ee9b2257ba0c5920968a65fd094b.lean#L1576).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a866e79d6e525d1d7bdbfbfeb2574af4639840e1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
