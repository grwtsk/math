## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:598afd48-261a-d6bc-4f1a-af1fc074e5e2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 111–122.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem complete_tail_lower_of_exact_mean (M1 R : ℝ) (hM1 : 0 ≤ M1)
    (hR : 40 ≤ R) (hmean : actualF7MeanBound M1 R) :
    ∀ A : ℝ, calibratedRadius R ≤ A → -exactMeanTailBudget M1 R ≤ completeXiTail A := by
  intro A hA
  have hm := complete_tail_abs_le_exact_mean M1 R A hR hA hmean
  have hd := div_le_div_of_nonneg_left
    (mul_nonneg (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) ≤ 2)
      (tailEnergyCoefficient_pos (calibratedRadius R)).le) (calibratedRadius_pos R) hA
  have hb : |completeXiTail A| ≤ exactMeanTailBudget M1 R := by
    exact hm.trans (mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right (by linarith only [hd]) hM1)
  exact (neg_le_neg hb).trans (neg_abs_le _)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceExactEnergyMeanConsumer/Variant3c3d3525bc9a0f746ad04dfae51fedc3661cd3f377b76273cfebc2e6663daa0f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceExactEnergyMeanConsumer/Variant3c3d3525bc9a0f746ad04dfae51fedc3661cd3f377b76273cfebc2e6663daa0f.lean#L111).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a818391a40882e1455cedd8fe4a4e8bf57397666` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
