## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3b41f638e1bd839fc2f8b4de295f696254cac7ff0c1d4b0632d61073d080abc1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 250–262.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def homeoRealMixedSpacePolarSpace : realMixedSpace K ≃ₜ polarSpace K :=

  continuous_toFun := by
    change Continuous fun x : realMixedSpace K ↦  (fun w ↦ if hw : w.IsReal then x.1 ⟨w, hw⟩ else
      (x.2 ⟨w, not_isReal_iff_isComplex.mp hw⟩).1, fun w ↦ (x.2 w).2)
    refine .prodMk (continuous_pi fun w ↦ ?_) (by fun_prop)
    split_ifs <;> fun_prop
  continuous_invFun := by
    change Continuous fun x : polarSpace K ↦
      (⟨fun w ↦ x.1 w.val, fun w ↦ ⟨x.1 w.val, x.2 w⟩⟩ : realMixedSpace K)
    fun_prop }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PolarCoord/Variant2159f1bc9469c26acf768d74d03403e9de806e9c81be02f9f1673279abb7f8c7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PolarCoord/Variant2159f1bc9469c26acf768d74d03403e9de806e9c81be02f9f1673279abb7f8c7.lean#L250).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d9d01d640d4a633bf14ca44638078910a382d48b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
