## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ba97a134-e158-9c81-bd02-58e250cf804e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 472–484.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem compensatedSourceSum_hasDerivAt {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) :
    HasDerivAt compensatedSourceSum (compensatedScaleDerivative A) A := by
  have hf : HasDerivAt (compensatedSourceSumFixed (localUpperCutoff A))
      (∑ n ∈ Finset.Icc 2 (localUpperCutoff A),
        (ArithmeticFunction.vonMangoldt n - 1) * closedPrimeWeightScaleDerivative A n) A := by
    unfold compensatedSourceSumFixed
    exact HasDerivAt.fun_sum fun n _ => (closedPrimeWeight_hasDerivAt hA n).const_mul _
  have hN : ⌊Real.exp (2 * A)⌋₊ ≤ localUpperCutoff A :=
    Nat.floor_mono (Real.exp_le_exp.mpr (by linarith))
  rw [← compensatedScaleDerivative_eq_fixed hA _ hN] at hf
  exact hf.congr_of_eventuallyEq (compensatedSourceSum_eventually_eq_fixed hA)

/-- The observable is C¹ on every positive scale, retaining all-real quantification. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceCompensatedFourier/Variant5b784ca9510f8b2803a4416fbb92c2d2e7bb977db9b8ae43027f6287e6a72b39.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceCompensatedFourier/Variant5b784ca9510f8b2803a4416fbb92c2d2e7bb977db9b8ae43027f6287e6a72b39.lean#L472).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b8c9f99a1c30e0fee0fa4a8fcb1cf3fd3c3d818c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
