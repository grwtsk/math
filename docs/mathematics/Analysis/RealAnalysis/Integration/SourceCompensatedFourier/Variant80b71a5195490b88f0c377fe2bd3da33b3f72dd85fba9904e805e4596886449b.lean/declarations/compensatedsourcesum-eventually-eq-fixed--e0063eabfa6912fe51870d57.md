## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f6c989df-374d-277a-dbbf-5da99adea179`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 466–472.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem compensatedSourceSum_eventually_eq_fixed {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) :
    compensatedSourceSum =ᶠ[nhds A] compensatedSourceSumFixed (localUpperCutoff A) := by
  filter_upwards [eventually_gt_nhds hA, eventually_lt_nhds (lt_add_one A)] with B hB hBA
  apply compensatedSourceSum_eq_fixed hB
  exact Nat.floor_mono (Real.exp_le_exp.mpr (by linarith))

/-- The actual all-integer compensated scalar is differentiable across cutoff changes. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceCompensatedFourier/Variant80b71a5195490b88f0c377fe2bd3da33b3f72dd85fba9904e805e4596886449b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceCompensatedFourier/Variant80b71a5195490b88f0c377fe2bd3da33b3f72dd85fba9904e805e4596886449b.lean#L466).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9b9131602905029d67b5926c129e76f07a0b4d11` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
