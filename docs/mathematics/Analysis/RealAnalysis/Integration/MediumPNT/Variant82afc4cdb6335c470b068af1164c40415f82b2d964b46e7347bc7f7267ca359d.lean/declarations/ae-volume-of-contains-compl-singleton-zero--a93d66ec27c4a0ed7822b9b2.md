## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e1792197-fca3-03d3-3c05-174021b9f36e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1624–1652.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ae_volume_of_contains_compl_singleton_zero
  (s : Set ℝ)
  (h : (univ : Set ℝ) \ {0} ⊆ s) :
  s ∈ (MeasureTheory.ae volume) := by
  -- The key insight is that {0} has measure zero in ℝ
  have h_zero_null : volume ({0} : Set ℝ) = 0 := by
    exact volume_singleton

  -- Since s contains univ \ {0} = ℝ \ {0}, its complement is contained in {0}
  have h_compl_subset : sᶜ ⊆ {0} := by
    intro x hx
    -- If x is not in s, then x is not in ℝ \ {0} (since ℝ \ {0} is a subset of s)
    -- This means x = 0
    by_contra h_not_zero
    have : x ∈ univ \ {0} := ⟨trivial, h_not_zero⟩
    exact hx (h this)

  -- Therefore, volume(sᶜ) ≤ volume({0}) = 0
  have h_compl_measure : volume sᶜ ≤ volume ({0} : Set ℝ) :=
    measure_mono h_compl_subset

  -- So volume(sᶜ) = 0
  have h_compl_zero : volume sᶜ = 0 := by
    rw [h_zero_null] at h_compl_measure
    exact le_antisymm h_compl_measure (by positivity)

  -- A set is in ae.sets iff its complement has measure zero
  rwa [mem_ae_iff]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MediumPNT/Variant82afc4cdb6335c470b068af1164c40415f82b2d964b46e7347bc7f7267ca359d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MediumPNT/Variant82afc4cdb6335c470b068af1164c40415f82b2d964b46e7347bc7f7267ca359d.lean#L1624).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3d1604bd6db34c61b3582358bc0ae0ae72c87a0c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
