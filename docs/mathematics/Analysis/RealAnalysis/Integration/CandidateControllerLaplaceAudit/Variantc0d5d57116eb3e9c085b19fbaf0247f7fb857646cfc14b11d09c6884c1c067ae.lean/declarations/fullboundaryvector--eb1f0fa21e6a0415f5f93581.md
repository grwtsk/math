## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6bf3c37e35eda13da0328f84ce532f989478e45b5b1ab01d81b7d93cf6c331e6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 64–69.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def fullBoundaryVector (X : ℕ) (hX : 1 ≤ X) (ε h : ℝ)
    (hε : 0 < ε) (hh : 0 < h) (hh1 : h ≤ 1) : FullH :=
  𝓕⁻ ((candidate_frequency_admission X hX ε h hε hh hh1).2.toLp
    (angularFrequency (candidate X ε h)))

/-- The full-line quotient representative is the genuine angular inverse almost everywhere. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CandidateControllerLaplaceAudit/Variantc0d5d57116eb3e9c085b19fbaf0247f7fb857646cfc14b11d09c6884c1c067ae.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CandidateControllerLaplaceAudit/Variantc0d5d57116eb3e9c085b19fbaf0247f7fb857646cfc14b11d09c6884c1c067ae.lean#L64).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2212b2cc57dbfe7d980c16eb458af96aa7645951` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
