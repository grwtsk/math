## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:238b5c38-3bac-86c1-abb3-15e1905e78f6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 174–182.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem compensatedIntegrand_continuousOn (x : ℝ) :
    ContinuousOn (compensatedIntegrand x) (Ioi 0) := by
  unfold compensatedIntegrand
  apply ContinuousOn.div (by fun_prop) (by fun_prop)
  intro t ht
  change 0 < t at ht
  apply mul_ne_zero (ne_of_gt ht)
  exact ne_of_gt (sub_pos.mpr (by simpa using Real.exp_lt_exp.mpr (by linarith : 0 < 2 * t)))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceAttempt8/Variant0e08c2815cd1e1a8350c881e77034ff4b04fb9b0b04719122b36f22ae78a7b2c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceAttempt8/Variant0e08c2815cd1e1a8350c881e77034ff4b04fb9b0b04719122b36f22ae78a7b2c.lean#L174).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d3a5a015e85b6e477f0b7ee5bb344cd6310eee41` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
