## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7b594a2a-3cfa-38ae-1981-5515f655fe2a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 225–239.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem localized_forward_atom_ne_original :
    localizedForwardProfile 1 1 {3} (fun _ ↦ 1) ≠ forwardProfile 1 {3} (fun _ ↦ 1) := by
  intro h
  have he := congrFun h (Real.log 3)
  have hl : (1 : ℝ) < Real.log 3 := by
    exact (Real.lt_log_iff_exp_lt (by norm_num)).2 Real.exp_one_lt_three
  have hx : Real.log 3 ∉ overlapWindow 1 1 := by
    simp only [overlapWindow, Nat.cast_one, Real.log_one, zero_sub, sub_zero, mem_Icc]
    exact fun hmem ↦ (not_le_of_gt hl) hmem.2
  simp only [localizedForwardProfile, indicator_of_notMem hx, forwardProfile,
    Finset.sum_singleton, Nat.cast_ofNat, sub_self, one_mul] at he
  exact normalized_source_one_zero_ne he.symm

end
end FormalResearch.RiemannHypothesis.SourceHankelLocalization
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/4SourceHankelLocalization/Variantcf248e4c6238837b13101a0670c7f9d67f6ce6690bd67275d3d0ca13cabd907b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/4SourceHankelLocalization/Variantcf248e4c6238837b13101a0670c7f9d67f6ce6690bd67275d3d0ca13cabd907b.lean#L225).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `390bafa19f023a8cb6faa922f7caf7ce15c6cdd1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
