## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a581de9d-45fd-7cf6-748b-c2835aa1d1b2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 363–392.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem collectBoundsWithInv_getElem (e : Expr) :
    ∀ parts bounds (h : collectBoundsWithInv e parts = some bounds),
      ∀ i (hi : i < parts.length),
        integrateInterval1WithInv e (parts[i]'(by simpa using hi)) =
          some (bounds[i]'(by
          have hlen := collectBoundsWithInv_length e parts bounds h
          exact hlen ▸ hi)) := by
  intro parts
  induction parts with
  | nil =>
    intro bounds h i hi
    simp [collectBoundsWithInv] at h
    cases h
    simp at hi
  | cons I Is ih =>
    intro bounds h i hi
    simp [collectBoundsWithInv] at h
    cases hI : integrateInterval1WithInv e I <;>
      cases hIs : collectBoundsWithInv e Is <;>
      simp [hI, hIs] at h
    cases h
    cases i with
    | zero =>
      simp [List.getElem_cons, hI]
    | succ i =>
      have hi' : i < Is.length := by
        simpa [List.length] using hi
      have hrec := ih _ hIs i hi'
      simp [hrec]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integration/Variant291bb4d6a4a6527078bde15fa86106116dba30e159114f684c63934ebc467a21.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integration/Variant291bb4d6a4a6527078bde15fa86106116dba30e159114f684c63934ebc467a21.lean#L363).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `311dd7c19f7fb27658208c4be11e77820aa7f316` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
