## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:03e93d91770bbe7cc7f33beb8dec4be74ce4b002180e9c855a7fe09a442d4d52`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 713–717.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def searchPartitionLower (e : Expr) (I : IntervalRat) (startN maxN : ℕ) (c : ℚ) :
    Option IntervalRat :=
  searchPartitionLowerAux e I startN maxN c 20  -- 20 doublings allows up to startN * 2^20

/-- Exponential search with explicit fuel for upper bounds. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integration/Variantf6c8f74faf502776275ce59c6a707ea6f1245a3fca4def128d51d413ee250131.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integration/Variantf6c8f74faf502776275ce59c6a707ea6f1245a3fca4def128d51d413ee250131.lean#L713).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3b7d4c1861f6e1e2bb0a88ec270b0b892d196bec` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
