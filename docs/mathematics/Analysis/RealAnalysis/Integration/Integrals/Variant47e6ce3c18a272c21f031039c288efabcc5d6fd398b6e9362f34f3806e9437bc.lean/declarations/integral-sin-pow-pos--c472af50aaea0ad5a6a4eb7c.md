## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b3564a8f-fe8f-b650-62a7-b9c92118d8d1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 707–713.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integral_sin_pow_pos : 0 < ∫ x in (0)..π, sin x ^ n := by
  rcases even_or_odd' n with ⟨k, rfl | rfl⟩ <;>
  simp only [integral_sin_pow_even, integral_sin_pow_odd] <;>
  refine mul_pos (by norm_num [pi_pos]) (prod_pos fun n _ => div_pos ?_ ?_) <;>
  norm_cast <;>
  omega

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integrals/Variant47e6ce3c18a272c21f031039c288efabcc5d6fd398b6e9362f34f3806e9437bc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integrals/Variant47e6ce3c18a272c21f031039c288efabcc5d6fd398b6e9362f34f3806e9437bc.lean#L707).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2fd1ea33ad96788ea11b190c6e518ae7b039ccfe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
