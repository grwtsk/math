## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2b89514d-e05b-0130-c25e-5bcaea1eb9cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 567–582.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (∫ x in a..b, Complex.cos (z * x)) = Complex.sin (z * b) / z - Complex.sin (z * a) / z := by

  have b : HasDerivAt (fun y => y * z : ℂ → ℂ) z ↑x := hasDerivAt_mul_const _
  have c : HasDerivAt (Complex.sin ∘ fun y : ℂ => (y * z)) _ ↑x := HasDerivAt.comp (𝕜 := ℂ) x a b
  have d := HasDerivAt.comp_ofReal (c.div_const z)
  simp only [mul_comm] at d
  convert d using 1

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integrals/Variant47e6ce3c18a272c21f031039c288efabcc5d6fd398b6e9362f34f3806e9437bc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Integrals/Variant47e6ce3c18a272c21f031039c288efabcc5d6fd398b6e9362f34f3806e9437bc.lean#L567).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2fd1ea33ad96788ea11b190c6e518ae7b039ccfe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
