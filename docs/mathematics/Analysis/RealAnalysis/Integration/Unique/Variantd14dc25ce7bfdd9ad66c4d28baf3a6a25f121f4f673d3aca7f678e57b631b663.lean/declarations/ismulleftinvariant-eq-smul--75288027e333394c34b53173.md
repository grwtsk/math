## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:224e147f-f73b-c02e-1af5-ceb6d0967fc7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 922–933.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isMulLeftInvariant_eq_smul [LocallyCompactSpace G] [SecondCountableTopology G]
    (μ' μ : Measure G) [IsHaarMeasure μ] [IsFiniteMeasureOnCompacts μ'] [IsMulLeftInvariant μ'] :
    μ' = haarScalarFactor μ' μ • μ :=
  isMulLeftInvariant_eq_smul_of_regular μ' μ
  -- one could use as well `isMulLeftInvariant_eq_smul_of_innerRegular`, as in a
  -- second countable topological space all Haar measures are regular and inner regular


/-- An invariant σ-finite measure is absolutely continuous with respect to a Haar measure in a
second countable group. -/
@[to_additive
/-- An invariant measure is absolutely continuous with respect to an additive Haar measure. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Unique/Variantd14dc25ce7bfdd9ad66c4d28baf3a6a25f121f4f673d3aca7f678e57b631b663.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Unique/Variantd14dc25ce7bfdd9ad66c4d28baf3a6a25f121f4f673d3aca7f678e57b631b663.lean#L922).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d8f27cee36e757273dbc80d255aaf98ed21bc354` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
