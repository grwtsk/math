## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9f38bcea-b30d-bafa-581f-14d302b8dd9c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 133–147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actual_shifted_reflection_negative (A : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    ∃ a : ℝ, 0 < a ∧ a < A ∧
      (∫ x : ℝ, normalizedTest explicitSecondDerivative A (x + a) *
        normalizedTest explicitSecondDerivative A (-x + a)) < 0 := by
  obtain ⟨t, ht0, htA, ht⟩ := CorrelationSign.actual_correlation_negative_interior A hA
  refine ⟨t / 2, by linarith, by linarith, ?_⟩
  have hr := shifted_source_reflection A (t / 2) (t / 2) 0 hA
  simp only [zero_sub, zero_add] at hr
  rw [hr]
  convert ht using 1
  congr 1

end
end MangoldtReflectionScratch

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MangoldtReflection/Variantc85046af638cafa906145576516f45140571d960d9c68d1a366031533ffecd45.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MangoldtReflection/Variantc85046af638cafa906145576516f45140571d960d9c68d1a366031533ffecd45.lean#L133).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a0c417c76931c62c4b83801784017f4eb924395` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
