## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fa3ea3ea-526a-4676-0784-7c2905beec99`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 403–414.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem causal_integrand_identity (f : H) (t a : ℝ) :
    fixedKernel (t - a) • (Ioi (0 : ℝ)).indicator f a =
      (Ioc 0 t).indicator (fun s => fixedKernel (t - s) • f s) a := by
  by_cases ha : 0 < a
  · rw [indicator_of_mem (show a ∈ Ioi (0 : ℝ) from ha)]
    by_cases hat : a ≤ t
    · rw [indicator_of_mem (show a ∈ Ioc 0 t from ⟨ha, hat⟩)]
    · rw [indicator_of_notMem (show a ∉ Ioc 0 t from fun h => hat h.2)]
      rw [fixedKernel_zero_of_nonpos (t - a) (by linarith), zero_smul]
  · rw [indicator_of_notMem (show a ∉ Ioi (0 : ℝ) from ha),
      indicator_of_notMem (show a ∉ Ioc 0 t from fun h => ha h.1), smul_zero]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceConvolutionAeCombined/Variant65265a26cd72940bf697a8c0c7a6c79ec114c3d6ce15c9c8b1043cbb839f7098.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceConvolutionAeCombined/Variant65265a26cd72940bf697a8c0c7a6c79ec114c3d6ce15c9c8b1043cbb839f7098.lean#L403).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0eaf8d07c4775b88286bce7344d5b5547070f59a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
