## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8666d974-38f9-06f8-c53b-b3ae98bb0481`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 210–233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem density_resolution_budget {C η A : ℝ}
    (hC : 0 ≤ C) (hη : 0 < η) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    Real.exp A*((1/2 : ℝ)+5/A)*mesh A (densityResolutionCount C η A)*
      (4*A+C) ≤ η := by
  let n := densityResolutionCount C η A
  have hn : 1 ≤ n := densityResolutionCount_pos C η A
  have hn0 : 0 < (n : ℝ) := by exact_mod_cast (show 0 < n by omega)
  have hceil : 11*A*Real.exp A*(4*A+C)/η ≤ (n : ℝ) := by
    exact (Nat.le_ceil _).trans (by exact_mod_cast (le_max_right 1 _))
  have hcost : 11*A*Real.exp A*(4*A+C) ≤ η*(n : ℝ) := by
    have hc := (div_le_iff₀ hη).mp hceil
    simpa only [mul_comm] using hc
  have hW : 0 ≤ 4*A+C := by linarith
  have hh : 0 ≤ mesh A n := (mesh_pos hA hn).le

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/DensityDecoder/Variant4d7b33cb9e8194213b9c748324c463505c7737ab17955312e398040074545329.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/DensityDecoder/Variant4d7b33cb9e8194213b9c748324c463505c7737ab17955312e398040074545329.lean#L210).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d000b00ed2c3d18846409259044a65e427c6db9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
