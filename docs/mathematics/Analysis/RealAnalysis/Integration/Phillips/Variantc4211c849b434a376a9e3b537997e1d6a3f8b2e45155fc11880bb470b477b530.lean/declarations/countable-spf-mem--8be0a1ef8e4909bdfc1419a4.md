## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:78ba4073-4f0a-9c48-89f4-c091c91422c0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 496–515.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### A counterexample for the Pettis integral

We construct a function `f` from `[0,1]` to a complete Banach space `B`, which is weakly measurable
(i.e., for any continuous linear form `φ` on `B` the function `φ ∘ f` is measurable), bounded in
norm (i.e., for all `x`, one has `‖f x‖ ≤ 1`), and still `f` has no Pettis integral.

This construction, due to Phillips, requires the continuum hypothesis. We will take for `B` the
space of all bounded functions on `ℝ`, with the supremum norm (no measure here, we are really
talking of everywhere defined functions). And `f x` will be the characteristic function of a set
which is large (it has countable complement), as in the Sierpinski pathological family.

/-- A family of bounded functions `f_x` from `ℝ` (seen with the discrete topology) to `ℝ` (in fact
taking values in `{0, 1}`), indexed by a real parameter `x`, corresponding to the characteristic
functions of the different fibers of the Sierpinski pathological family -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Phillips/Variantc4211c849b434a376a9e3b537997e1d6a3f8b2e45155fc11880bb470b477b530.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Phillips/Variantc4211c849b434a376a9e3b537997e1d6a3f8b2e45155fc11880bb470b477b530.lean#L496).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `991551b0c73179f1f965fb62118e5b9f577fdfde` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
