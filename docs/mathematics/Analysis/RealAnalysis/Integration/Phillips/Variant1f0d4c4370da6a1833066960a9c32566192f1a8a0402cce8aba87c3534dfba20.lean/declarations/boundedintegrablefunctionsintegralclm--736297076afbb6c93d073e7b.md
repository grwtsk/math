## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:22feea9d090636c5f45e3f77321ef5e4ee941e36687dca4907cec7348fdec233`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 125–140.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def boundedIntegrableFunctionsIntegralCLM [MeasurableSpace α] (μ : Measure α) [IsFiniteMeasure μ] :
    boundedIntegrableFunctions μ →L[ℝ] ℝ :=
  LinearMap.mkContinuous (E := ↥(boundedIntegrableFunctions μ))
    { toFun := fun f => ∫ x, f.1 x ∂μ
      map_add' := fun f g => integral_add f.2 g.2
      map_smul' := fun c f => integral_smul c f.1 } (μ.real univ)

      intro f
      rw [mul_comm]
      apply norm_integral_le_of_norm_le_const
      apply Filter.Eventually.of_forall
      intro x
      exact BoundedContinuousFunction.norm_coe_le_norm f.1 x)

/-- Given a measure, there exists a continuous linear form on the space of all bounded functions
(not necessarily measurable) that coincides with the integral on bounded measurable functions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Phillips/Variant1f0d4c4370da6a1833066960a9c32566192f1a8a0402cce8aba87c3534dfba20.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Phillips/Variant1f0d4c4370da6a1833066960a9c32566192f1a8a0402cce8aba87c3534dfba20.lean#L125).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `82d4373ee90daf79bd0c2954b8a60cc96f575818` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
