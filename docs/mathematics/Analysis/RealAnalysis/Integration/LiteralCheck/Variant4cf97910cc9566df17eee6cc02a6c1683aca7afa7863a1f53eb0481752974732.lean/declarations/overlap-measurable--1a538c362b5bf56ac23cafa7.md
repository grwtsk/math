## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8e901af8-1ca6-4cfc-c5cc-30450788276a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 212–217.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem overlap_measurable (a b : ℝ) :
    Measurable (fun p : ℝ × ℝ => overlap a b p.1 p.2) := by
  unfold overlap
  exact Measurable.ite (by measurability) (by fun_prop) (by fun_prop)

/-- The signed double Gram integrand uses the unmodified actual real kernel. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LiteralCheck/Variant4cf97910cc9566df17eee6cc02a6c1683aca7afa7863a1f53eb0481752974732.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LiteralCheck/Variant4cf97910cc9566df17eee6cc02a6c1683aca7afa7863a1f53eb0481752974732.lean#L212).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb26e09ed691f93484216d36c410eeff1212d8d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
