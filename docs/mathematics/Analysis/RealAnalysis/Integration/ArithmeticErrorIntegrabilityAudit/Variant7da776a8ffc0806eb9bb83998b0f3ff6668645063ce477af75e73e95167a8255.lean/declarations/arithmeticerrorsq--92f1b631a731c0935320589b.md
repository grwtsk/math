## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:05c7c357832dd68cbc86ed2e53e85c4e5e51bd3c8af1dd8456d4b43e00add273`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 610–615.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def arithmeticErrorSq (X : ℕ) (ε h : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  (1/(2*Real.pi)) * ∫ t : ℝ,
    ‖boundaryFilter ε h t * (1-riemannZeta (1/2+(t : ℂ)*Complex.I) *
      correctedNumerator X ((ε : ℂ)+(t : ℂ)*Complex.I))‖^2

/-- Every finite corrected family has a genuine signed arithmetic-error square integral. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ArithmeticErrorIntegrabilityAudit/Variant7da776a8ffc0806eb9bb83998b0f3ff6668645063ce477af75e73e95167a8255.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ArithmeticErrorIntegrabilityAudit/Variant7da776a8ffc0806eb9bb83998b0f3ff6668645063ce477af75e73e95167a8255.lean#L610).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b83af5b73ea76868130e99a82cd5bf551aba1da8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
