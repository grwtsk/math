## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:04abd3ddbf0eed6fdcf58e87c955786ee4339e1b7ccbf0617503497a50899eb0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 29–34.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def translatedFactorialMajorant (d x : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  d ^ (-(3 : ℝ) / 2) *
    ((5 * Real.log d ^ 2 + 20 * Real.log d) * factorialAbsLogWeight 0 (x * d⁻¹) +
      (10 * Real.log d + 20) * factorialAbsLogWeight 1 (x * d⁻¹) +
        5 * factorialAbsLogWeight 2 (x * d⁻¹))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/D9972fcb5a21e569700bSourceCancelledFactorialSectorBudget/Variant2020d3b99829d00b5bfbeaf7529509171d720748ff303bda983ffa2e52c3d470.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/D9972fcb5a21e569700bSourceCancelledFactorialSectorBudget/Variant2020d3b99829d00b5bfbeaf7529509171d720748ff303bda983ffa2e52c3d470.lean#L29).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `133060430e17a8fb6afabb97e0bd14d82edc3161` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
