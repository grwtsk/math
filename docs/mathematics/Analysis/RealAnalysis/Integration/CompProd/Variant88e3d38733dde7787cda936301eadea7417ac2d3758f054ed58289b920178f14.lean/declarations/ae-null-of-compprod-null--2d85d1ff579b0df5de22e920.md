## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:38ac16c7-3d49-1761-d12c-bc10ec2cac1e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 250–259.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ae_null_of_compProd_null (h : (κ ⊗ₖ η) a s = 0) :
    (fun b => η (a, b) (Prod.mk b ⁻¹' s)) =ᵐ[κ a] 0 := by
  obtain ⟨t, hst, mt, ht⟩ := exists_measurable_superset_of_null h
  simp_rw [compProd_null a mt] at ht
  rw [Filter.eventuallyLE_antisymm_iff]
  exact
    ⟨Filter.EventuallyLE.trans_eq
        (Filter.Eventually.of_forall fun x => measure_mono (Set.preimage_mono hst)) ht,
      Filter.Eventually.of_forall fun x => zero_le⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CompProd/Variant88e3d38733dde7787cda936301eadea7417ac2d3758f054ed58289b920178f14.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/CompProd/Variant88e3d38733dde7787cda936301eadea7417ac2d3758f054ed58289b920178f14.lean#L250).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e47ac10926d54b4cf16ca43559edc7d80d5bc714` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
