## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2133e1fd-fddc-83fa-406f-1736553909fb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 76–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (b y : ℝ) :
    (1 / (2 * Real.pi) : ℂ) * ∫ t : ℝ, paperFT (tilt k b) t * cexp (-I * t * y)
      = k y * (Real.exp (b * y) : ℂ) := by
  have hcont := (tilt_contDiff hk b).continuous
  have hint : Integrable (tilt k b) (volume : Measure ℝ) :=

  have hF := Zeta23.EF.integrable_fourier_of_contDiff_two (tilt_contDiff hk b)
    (tilt_hasCompactSupport hkc b)
  have h1 := Zeta23.EF.paper_inversion hcont hint hF y

terms.  −ζ'/ζ = LSeries ↗Λ on Re s > 1 (Mathlib), then distribute paperFT (tilt k b) t. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/VerticalLine/Variant516baed114065c665177653efcbc3155ed859af646ab544a261ea1b0f615aae6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/VerticalLine/Variant516baed114065c665177653efcbc3155ed859af646ab544a261ea1b0f615aae6.lean#L76).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d46f9e1c7eddbb2134e8f3c282dcf3ff9334f8c9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
