## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:92d096e3-8175-cf22-2ba7-7ab2ccb1e5cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 450–521.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

The $\nu$ function has Mellin transform $\mathcal{M}(\nu)(s)$ which is entire and decays (at
least) like $1/|s|$.

[Of course it decays faster than any power of $|s|$, but it turns out that we will just need one
power.]

  The Mellin transform of $\nu$ is
  $$\mathcal{M}(\nu)(s) =  O\left(\frac{1}{|s|}\right),$$
  as $|s|\to\infty$ with $\sigma_1 \le \Re(s) \le 2$.

  Integrate by parts:
  $$
  \left|\int_0^\infty \nu(x)x^s\frac{dx}{x}\right| =
  \left|-\int_0^\infty \nu'(x)\frac{x^{s}}{s}dx\right|
  $$
  $$
  \le \frac{1}{|s|} \int_{1/2}^2|\nu'(x)|x^{\Re(s)}dx.
  $$
  Since $\Re(s)$ is bounded, the right-hand side is bounded by a
  constant times $1/|s|$.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MellinCalculus/Variant31879c3722af010ccbe131c80cc4015e20f0ded1c52c6968a974db13cd6373b8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
