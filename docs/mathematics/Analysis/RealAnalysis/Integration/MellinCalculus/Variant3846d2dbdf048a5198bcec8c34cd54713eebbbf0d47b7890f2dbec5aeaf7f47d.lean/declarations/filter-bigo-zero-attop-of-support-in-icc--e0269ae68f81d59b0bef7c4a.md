## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:89d69ebd-cfa7-a427-3999-c2ba5f646213`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 206–213.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Filter.BigO_zero_atTop_of_support_in_Icc {a b : ℝ} (f : ℝ → 𝕂)
    (fSupp : f.support ⊆ Set.Icc a b) :
    f =O[atTop] fun _ ↦ (0 : ℝ) := by
  refine Eventually.isBigO ?_
  filter_upwards [Ioi_mem_atTop b] with c hc; replace hc := mem_Ioi.mp hc
  refine norm_le_zero_iff.mpr <| Function.support_subset_iff'.mp fSupp c ?_
  exact fun h ↦ by linarith [mem_Icc.mp h]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MellinCalculus/Variant3846d2dbdf048a5198bcec8c34cd54713eebbbf0d47b7890f2dbec5aeaf7f47d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MellinCalculus/Variant3846d2dbdf048a5198bcec8c34cd54713eebbbf0d47b7890f2dbec5aeaf7f47d.lean#L206).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `57ff0ec1a5d72f2045d3e6c141a3287e476528ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
