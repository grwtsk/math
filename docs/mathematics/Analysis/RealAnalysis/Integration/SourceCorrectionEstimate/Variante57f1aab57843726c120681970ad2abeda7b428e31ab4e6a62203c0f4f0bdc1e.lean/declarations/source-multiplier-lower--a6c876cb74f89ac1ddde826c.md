## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cf3ad0f1-6191-26b4-af19-c879d5151ac5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 34–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma source_multiplier_lower (ξ : ℝ) : archimedeanMultiplier 0 ≤ archimedeanMultiplier ξ := by
  have hs := (AdmissionSource.quarter_series ξ).tsum_eq
  have hn : 0 ≤ ∑' n : ℕ, kernel (ξ / 2) (n + 1 / 4) :=
    tsum_nonneg (fun n : ℕ ↦ kernel_nonneg (ξ / 2) (n + 1 / 4) (by positivity))
  rw [hs] at hn
  have hzero : archimedeanMultiplier 0 = -archimedeanConstant := by
    simp [archimedeanMultiplier, archimedeanConstant]
  linarith

/-- Integrating the multiplier bound retains the exact Fourier-mass hypothesis. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceCorrectionEstimate/Variante57f1aab57843726c120681970ad2abeda7b428e31ab4e6a62203c0f4f0bdc1e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceCorrectionEstimate/Variante57f1aab57843726c120681970ad2abeda7b428e31ab4e6a62203c0f4f0bdc1e.lean#L34).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5870acb7418744ea9916a462b97c1ce479afaee6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
