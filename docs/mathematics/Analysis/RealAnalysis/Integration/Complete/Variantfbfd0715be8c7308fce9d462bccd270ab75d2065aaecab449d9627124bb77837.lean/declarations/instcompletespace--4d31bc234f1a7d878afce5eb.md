## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f4f27b9741fdb8beb94678e9a852aec0e62d21f508a19f5187bd4788eb4c24c6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 395–399.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instCompleteSpace [CompleteSpace E] [hp : Fact (1 ≤ p)] : CompleteSpace (Lp E p μ) :=
  completeSpace_lp_of_cauchy_complete_eLpNorm fun _f hf _B hB h_cau =>
    cauchy_complete_eLpNorm hp.elim hf hB.ne h_cau

end MeasureTheory.Lp
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Complete/Variantfbfd0715be8c7308fce9d462bccd270ab75d2065aaecab449d9627124bb77837.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Complete/Variantfbfd0715be8c7308fce9d462bccd270ab75d2065aaecab449d9627124bb77837.lean#L395).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `df15e6c16bee2c1e7d25800d677338ed9caf0605` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
