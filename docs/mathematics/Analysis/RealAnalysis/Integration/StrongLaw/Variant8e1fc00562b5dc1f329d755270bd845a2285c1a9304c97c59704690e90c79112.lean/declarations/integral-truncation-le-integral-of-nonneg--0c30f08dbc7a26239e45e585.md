## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2cd94a12-8374-19a3-3501-80c6c41faca7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 187–198.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integral_truncation_le_integral_of_nonneg (hf : Integrable f μ) (h'f : 0 ≤ f) {A : ℝ} :
    ∫ x, truncation f A x ∂μ ≤ ∫ x, f x ∂μ := by
  apply integral_mono_of_nonneg
    (Eventually.of_forall fun x => ?_) hf (Eventually.of_forall fun x => ?_)
  · exact truncation_nonneg _ (h'f x)
  · calc
      truncation f A x ≤ |truncation f A x| := le_abs_self _
      _ ≤ |f x| := abs_truncation_le_abs_self _ _ _
      _ = f x := abs_of_nonneg (h'f x)

/-- If a function is integrable, then the integral of its truncated versions converges to the
integral of the whole function. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/StrongLaw/Variant8e1fc00562b5dc1f329d755270bd845a2285c1a9304c97c59704690e90c79112.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/StrongLaw/Variant8e1fc00562b5dc1f329d755270bd845a2285c1a9304c97c59704690e90c79112.lean#L187).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b0ea320986432c55f30165eda9bd1413c532769e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
