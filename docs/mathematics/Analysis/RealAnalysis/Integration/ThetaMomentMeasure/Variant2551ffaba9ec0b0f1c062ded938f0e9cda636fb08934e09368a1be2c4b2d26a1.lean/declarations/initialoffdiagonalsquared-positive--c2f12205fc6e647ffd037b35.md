## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cf81b015-2ead-c47f-3b7d-5be21c652d61`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 253–269.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem initialOffDiagonalSquared_positive {t : ℝ} (ht : 0 ≤ t) :
    0 < initialOffDiagonalSquared t := by
  have hm0 := moment_positive 0 ht
  have hv := centered_square_integral_positive (initialDiagonal t) ht
  rw [centered_square_integral _ ht] at hv
  have heq : initialOffDiagonalSquared t =
      (moment t 2 - 2 * initialDiagonal t * moment t 1 +
        initialDiagonal t ^ 2 * moment t 0) / moment t 0 := by

/-- Positive first hopping coefficient; this supplies the nonzero hypothesis
at the first transfer step without assuming a Jacobi construction. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ThetaMomentMeasure/Variant2551ffaba9ec0b0f1c062ded938f0e9cda636fb08934e09368a1be2c4b2d26a1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ThetaMomentMeasure/Variant2551ffaba9ec0b0f1c062ded938f0e9cda636fb08934e09368a1be2c4b2d26a1.lean#L253).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6d61a97bbbef77b66bc2c13cda190b37bd32491b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
