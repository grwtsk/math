## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bd0811ae-cc03-5e6c-d31d-72584adc9d08`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 476–488.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean

    (r : ℝ → ℝ) {A a b v : ℝ} (hs : tsupport r ⊆ Icc (-A) A)
    (hab : a ≤ b) (hv : v < a - A) : timeRow r a b v = 0 := by
  change (∫ t in a..b, errorWeight t * r (v - t)) = 0
  rw [intervalIntegral.integral_of_le hab]

    have hi := hs (subset_tsupport r hn)

  simp only [hz, mul_zero, Pi.zero_apply]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceRestrictedLowTimeWork/Variantdc0198fcffd8e7ead9a27e1340c16c11f4130f756838ea108e1756343d056f55.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceRestrictedLowTimeWork/Variantdc0198fcffd8e7ead9a27e1340c16c11f4130f756838ea108e1756343d056f55.lean#L476).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ab4c31ad7b2f396f1646be7cfe1c025367b492ae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
