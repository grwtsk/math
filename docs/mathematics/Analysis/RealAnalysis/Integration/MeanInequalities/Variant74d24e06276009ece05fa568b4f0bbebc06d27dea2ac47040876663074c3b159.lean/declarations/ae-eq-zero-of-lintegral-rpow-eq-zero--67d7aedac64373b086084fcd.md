## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fbb7262c-12b7-8e8e-1c84-21edb9a15132`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 131–137.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ae_eq_zero_of_lintegral_rpow_eq_zero {p : ℝ} (hp0 : 0 ≤ p) {f : α → ℝ≥0∞}
    (hf : AEMeasurable f μ) (hf_zero : ∫⁻ a, f a ^ p ∂μ = 0) : f =ᵐ[μ] 0 := by
  rw [lintegral_eq_zero_iff' (hf.pow_const p)] at hf_zero
  filter_upwards [hf_zero] with x
  rw [Pi.zero_apply, ← not_imp_not]
  exact fun hx => (rpow_pos_of_nonneg (pos_iff_ne_zero.2 hx) hp0).ne'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MeanInequalities/Variant74d24e06276009ece05fa568b4f0bbebc06d27dea2ac47040876663074c3b159.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MeanInequalities/Variant74d24e06276009ece05fa568b4f0bbebc06d27dea2ac47040876663074c3b159.lean#L131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `931e69ad6afb3c17b677b6029211c720218e4863` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
