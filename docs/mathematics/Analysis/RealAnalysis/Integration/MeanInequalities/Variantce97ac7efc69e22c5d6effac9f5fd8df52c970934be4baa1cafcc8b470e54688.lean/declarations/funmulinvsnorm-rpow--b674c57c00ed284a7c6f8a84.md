## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0dda7b5c-2ef8-97dc-c2f6-133c2702ca24`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 122–128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem funMulInvSnorm_rpow {p : ℝ} (hp0 : 0 < p) {f : α → ℝ≥0∞} {a : α} :
    funMulInvSnorm f p μ a ^ p = f a ^ p * (∫⁻ c, f c ^ p ∂μ)⁻¹ := by
  rw [funMulInvSnorm, mul_rpow_of_nonneg _ _ (le_of_lt hp0)]
  suffices h_inv_rpow : ((∫⁻ c : α, f c ^ p ∂μ) ^ (1 / p))⁻¹ ^ p = (∫⁻ c : α, f c ^ p ∂μ)⁻¹ by
    rw [h_inv_rpow]
  rw [inv_rpow, ← rpow_mul, one_div_mul_cancel hp0.ne', rpow_one]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MeanInequalities/Variantce97ac7efc69e22c5d6effac9f5fd8df52c970934be4baa1cafcc8b470e54688.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MeanInequalities/Variantce97ac7efc69e22c5d6effac9f5fd8df52c970934be4baa1cafcc8b470e54688.lean#L122).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `53befccea1c4cfd74d007141885038d43eb57766` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
