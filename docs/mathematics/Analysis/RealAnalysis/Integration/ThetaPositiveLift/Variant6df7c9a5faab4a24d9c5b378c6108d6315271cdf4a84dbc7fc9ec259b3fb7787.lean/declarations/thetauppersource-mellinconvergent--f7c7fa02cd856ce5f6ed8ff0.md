## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ff7baebf-6794-9e50-3a2d-3f96899dc18e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 127–135.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem thetaUpperSource_mellinConvergent (s : ℂ) :
    MellinConvergent thetaUpperSource s := by
  have hfull : MellinConvergent thetaStrongPair.f s :=
    (thetaSourcePair.isStrongFEPair_toStrongFEPair.hasMellin s).1
  unfold MellinConvergent thetaUpperSource
  simpa only [← indicator_smul] using hfull.indicator measurableSet_Ioi

/-- The reflected lower source also has an everywhere-convergent Mellin
transform. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ThetaPositiveLift/Variant6df7c9a5faab4a24d9c5b378c6108d6315271cdf4a84dbc7fc9ec259b3fb7787.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ThetaPositiveLift/Variant6df7c9a5faab4a24d9c5b378c6108d6315271cdf4a84dbc7fc9ec259b3fb7787.lean#L127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `afb3613da94f205be3bceb1ba5e93bd6b480a88b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
