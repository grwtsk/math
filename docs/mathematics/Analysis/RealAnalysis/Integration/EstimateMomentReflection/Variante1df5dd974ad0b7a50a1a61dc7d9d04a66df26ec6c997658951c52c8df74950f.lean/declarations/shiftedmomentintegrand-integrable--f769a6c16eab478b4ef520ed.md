## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9b51f249-0bf9-5221-6b0d-6e33772db32f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem shiftedMomentIntegrand_integrable
    {F : ℝ → ℝ} (hF : TwoMomentProfile F)
    (s : ℝ) :
    Integrable (shiftedMomentIntegrand F s) := by
  have hsupp :
      HasCompactSupport (fun r : ℝ => F (s + r)) := by
    have heq :
        (fun r : ℝ => F (s + r)) =
          F ∘ Homeomorph.addLeft s := by
      funext r
      rfl
    rw [heq]
    exact hF.2.1.comp_homeomorph (Homeomorph.addLeft s)
  have hc :
      Continuous (shiftedMomentIntegrand F s) := by
    unfold shiftedMomentIntegrand
    have hc := hF.1
    fun_prop
  exact hc.integrable_of_hasCompactSupport hsupp.mul_left

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/EstimateMomentReflection/Variante1df5dd974ad0b7a50a1a61dc7d9d04a66df26ec6c997658951c52c8df74950f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/EstimateMomentReflection/Variante1df5dd974ad0b7a50a1a61dc7d9d04a66df26ec6c997658951c52c8df74950f.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1d9de64c7673561dc8a4f201a1a3c3bcfb21ca43` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
