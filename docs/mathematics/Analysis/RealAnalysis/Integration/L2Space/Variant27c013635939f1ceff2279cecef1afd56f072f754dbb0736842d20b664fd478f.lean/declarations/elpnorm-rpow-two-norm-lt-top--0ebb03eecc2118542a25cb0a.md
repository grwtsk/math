## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aa46cbd7-7a65-0aba-7ab4-b21c42f1856d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–121.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eLpNorm_rpow_two_norm_lt_top (f : Lp F 2 μ) :
    eLpNorm (fun x => ‖f x‖ ^ (2 : ℝ)) 1 μ < ∞ := by
  have h_two : ENNReal.ofReal (2 : ℝ) = 2 := by simp
  rw [eLpNorm_norm_rpow f (Lp.aestronglyMeasurable f) zero_lt_two, one_mul, h_two]
  exact ENNReal.rpow_lt_top_of_nonneg zero_le_two (Lp.eLpNorm_ne_top f)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/L2Space/Variant27c013635939f1ceff2279cecef1afd56f072f754dbb0736842d20b664fd478f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/L2Space/Variant27c013635939f1ceff2279cecef1afd56f072f754dbb0736842d20b664fd478f.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6d1cb4f8902853c4bb2f2ec99c90281320108813` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
