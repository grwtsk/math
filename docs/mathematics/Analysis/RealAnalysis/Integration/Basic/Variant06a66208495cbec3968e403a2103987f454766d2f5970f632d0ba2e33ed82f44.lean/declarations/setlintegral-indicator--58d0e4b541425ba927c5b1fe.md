## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:676053d2-df09-0ecf-666a-c9feb157349f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 513–516.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma setLIntegral_indicator {s t : Set α} (hs : MeasurableSet s) (f : α → ℝ≥0∞) :
    ∫⁻ a in t, s.indicator f a ∂μ = ∫⁻ a in s ∩ t, f a ∂μ := by
  rw [lintegral_indicator hs, Measure.restrict_restrict hs]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant06a66208495cbec3968e403a2103987f454766d2f5970f632d0ba2e33ed82f44.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant06a66208495cbec3968e403a2103987f454766d2f5970f632d0ba2e33ed82f44.lean#L513).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1ef957f14cd9e7a26cce43a9b409c62fe1dd40f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
