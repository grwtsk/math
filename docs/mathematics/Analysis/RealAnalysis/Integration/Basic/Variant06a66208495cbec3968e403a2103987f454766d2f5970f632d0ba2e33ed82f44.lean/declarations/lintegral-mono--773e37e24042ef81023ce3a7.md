## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:56880e36-838f-3cfd-9da9-bdf56e9c147f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 82–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lintegral_mono' {m : MeasurableSpace α} ⦃μ ν : Measure α⦄ (hμν : μ ≤ ν) ⦃f g : α → ℝ≥0∞⦄
    (hfg : f ≤ g) : ∫⁻ a, f a ∂μ ≤ ∫⁻ a, g a ∂ν := by
  rw [lintegral, lintegral]
  exact iSup_mono fun φ => iSup_mono' fun hφ => ⟨le_trans hφ hfg, lintegral_mono (le_refl φ) hμν⟩

-- version where `hfg` is an explicit forall, so that `@[gcongr]` can recognize it
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant06a66208495cbec3968e403a2103987f454766d2f5970f632d0ba2e33ed82f44.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant06a66208495cbec3968e403a2103987f454766d2f5970f632d0ba2e33ed82f44.lean#L82).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1ef957f14cd9e7a26cce43a9b409c62fe1dd40f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
