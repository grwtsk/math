## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2d070010-d0ce-3fc9-c99b-8c3d7d6a6440`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1114–1123.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
@[simp] lemma eLpNorm_of_isEmpty [IsEmpty α] (f : α → ε) (p : ℝ≥0∞) : eLpNorm f p μ = 0 := by
  simp [Subsingleton.elim f 0]

end ENormedAddMonoid

section MapMeasure

variable {ε : Type*} [TopologicalSpace ε] [ContinuousENorm ε]
  {β : Type*} {mβ : MeasurableSpace β} {f : α → β} {g : β → ε}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant7b9c9c7159baa8d9c8f1c4720fa33c95f7bbb1b867ad44a3ede22a4b4bda213f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant7b9c9c7159baa8d9c8f1c4720fa33c95f7bbb1b867ad44a3ede22a4b4bda213f.lean#L1114).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3bb2e900bc730c504bc5bcece4c801a7c7ff9286` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
