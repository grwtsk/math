## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8eb4195f-e58a-7fce-8bb0-e3fca0a3d604`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 489–509.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_integralSum_toFilteriUnion_single (h : Integrable I l f vol) (hJ : J ≤ I) :
    Tendsto (integralSum f vol) (l.toFilteriUnion I (Prepartition.single I J hJ))
      (𝓝 <| integral J l f vol) :=
  let ⟨_y, h₁, h₂⟩ := h.to_subbox_aux hJ
  h₁.integral_eq.symm ▸ h₂

/-- **Henstock-Sacks inequality**. Let `r : ℝⁿ → (0, ∞)` be a function such that for any tagged
*partition* of `I` subordinate to `r`, the integral sum of `f` over this partition differs from the
integral of `f` by at most `ε`. Then for any tagged *prepartition* `π` subordinate to `r`, the
integral sum of `f` over this prepartition differs from the integral of `f` over the part of `I`
covered by `π` by at most `ε`.

The actual statement

- uses `BoxIntegral.Integrable.convergenceR` instead of a predicate assumption on `r`;
- uses `BoxIntegral.IntegrationParams.MemBaseSet` instead of “subordinate to `r`” to
  account for additional requirements like being a Henstock partition or having a bounded
  distortion;
- takes an extra argument `π₀ : prepartition I` and an assumption `π.Union = π₀.Union` instead of
  using `π.to_prepartition`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant3dc168fb1f62ba7d94ef453aec47b3dfa72c11dc4c9eb07a91f55d2a38b68ae5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant3dc168fb1f62ba7d94ef453aec47b3dfa72c11dc4c9eb07a91f55d2a38b68ae5.lean#L489).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5194566651b60ebf8b784cf94b7bd0a24aa47f94` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
