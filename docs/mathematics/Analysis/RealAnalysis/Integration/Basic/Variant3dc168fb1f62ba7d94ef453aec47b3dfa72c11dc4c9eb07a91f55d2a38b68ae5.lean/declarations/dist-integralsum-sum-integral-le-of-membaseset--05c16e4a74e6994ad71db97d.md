## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:65b94a3f-d23f-22b9-a9e6-09ec85af10ba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 568–574.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem dist_integralSum_sum_integral_le_of_memBaseSet (h : Integrable I l f vol) (h0 : 0 < ε)
    (hπ : l.MemBaseSet I c (h.convergenceR ε c) π) :
    dist (integralSum f vol π) (∑ J ∈ π.boxes, integral J l f vol) ≤ ε :=
  h.dist_integralSum_sum_integral_le_of_memBaseSet_of_iUnion_eq h0 hπ rfl

/-- Integral sum of `f` over a tagged prepartition `π` such that `π.Union = π₀.Union` tends to the
sum of integrals of `f` over the boxes of `π₀`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant3dc168fb1f62ba7d94ef453aec47b3dfa72c11dc4c9eb07a91f55d2a38b68ae5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant3dc168fb1f62ba7d94ef453aec47b3dfa72c11dc4c9eb07a91f55d2a38b68ae5.lean#L568).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5194566651b60ebf8b784cf94b7bd0a24aa47f94` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
