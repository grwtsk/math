## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8eb77e87-1105-b8a3-9f6f-b969b36d741f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 718–723.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integral_coe_le_of_lintegral_coe_le {f : α → ℝ≥0} {b : ℝ≥0} (h : ∫⁻ a, f a ∂μ ≤ b) :
    ∫ a, (f a : ℝ) ∂μ ≤ b := by
  by_cases hf : Integrable (fun a => (f a : ℝ)) μ
  · exact (lintegral_coe_le_coe_iff_integral_le hf).1 h
  · rw [integral_undef hf]; exact b.2

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variantcb9a18a3ab4ed7c88cdbe248bd10643324b56682e2c0b2687e6872d2a136a1b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variantcb9a18a3ab4ed7c88cdbe248bd10643324b56682e2c0b2687e6872d2a136a1b9.lean#L718).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `231f6160cc10a85ea9f0f54834862b6657c8c993` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
