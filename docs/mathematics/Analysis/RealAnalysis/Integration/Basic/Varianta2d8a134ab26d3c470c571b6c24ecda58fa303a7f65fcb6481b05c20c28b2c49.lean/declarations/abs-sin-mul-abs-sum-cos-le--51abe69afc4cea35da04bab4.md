## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4058c2ae-3086-07d4-e703-1cbcf58f4b3e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 793–804.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  have h := two_sin_mul_sum_cos α θ d
  have h2 : |2 * Real.sin (θ / 2) * ∑ k ∈ Finset.range d, Real.cos (α + k * θ)| ≤ 2 := by

`|sin(πy/L)|⁻¹ ≤ L/(2 min(y, L−y))`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Varianta2d8a134ab26d3c470c571b6c24ecda58fa303a7f65fcb6481b05c20c28b2c49.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Varianta2d8a134ab26d3c470c571b6c24ecda58fa303a7f65fcb6481b05c20c28b2c49.lean#L793).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f5598539f46f75f1cb8a084bcef17c567c1e3c8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
