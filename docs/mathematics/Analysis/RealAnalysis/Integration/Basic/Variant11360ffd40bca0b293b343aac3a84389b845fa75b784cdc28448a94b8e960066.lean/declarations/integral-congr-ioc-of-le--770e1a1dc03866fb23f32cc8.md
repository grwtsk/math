## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e7eb5c0f-17f4-0540-2f90-d50272f26da4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 29–38.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integral_congr_Ioc_of_le {a b : ℝ} (hab : a ≤ b)
    (h : ∀ u ∈ Ioc a b, f u = g u) :
    ∫ u in a..b, f u ∂μ = ∫ u in a..b, g u ∂μ := by
  refine integral_congr_ae' (Filter.Eventually.of_forall ?_) (Filter.Eventually.of_forall ?_) <;>
    intro u hu
  · exact h u hu
  · have hempty : Ioc b a = ∅ := Ioc_eq_empty hab.not_gt
    exact (hempty ▸ hu).elim

end intervalIntegral
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant11360ffd40bca0b293b343aac3a84389b845fa75b784cdc28448a94b8e960066.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant11360ffd40bca0b293b343aac3a84389b845fa75b784cdc28448a94b8e960066.lean#L29).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `785b527761880b9bc76f101d2a8e84181907f7da` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
