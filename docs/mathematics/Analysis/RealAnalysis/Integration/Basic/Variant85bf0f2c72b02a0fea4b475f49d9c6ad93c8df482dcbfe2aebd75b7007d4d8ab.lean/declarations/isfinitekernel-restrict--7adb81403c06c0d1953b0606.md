## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:679e875aea8b404a39c6a3f35179a3c1d303c31db12c4aa525690812ce26d919`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 276–281.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance IsFiniteKernel.restrict (κ : Kernel α β) [IsFiniteKernel κ] (hs : MeasurableSet s) :
    IsFiniteKernel (κ.restrict hs) := by
  refine ⟨⟨IsFiniteKernel.bound κ, IsFiniteKernel.bound_lt_top κ, fun a => ?_⟩⟩
  rw [restrict_apply' κ hs a MeasurableSet.univ]
  exact measure_le_bound κ a _

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant85bf0f2c72b02a0fea4b475f49d9c6ad93c8df482dcbfe2aebd75b7007d4d8ab.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant85bf0f2c72b02a0fea4b475f49d9c6ad93c8df482dcbfe2aebd75b7007d4d8ab.lean#L276).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `acc9f314beac08287c71bc33aca78f6c94fee49e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
