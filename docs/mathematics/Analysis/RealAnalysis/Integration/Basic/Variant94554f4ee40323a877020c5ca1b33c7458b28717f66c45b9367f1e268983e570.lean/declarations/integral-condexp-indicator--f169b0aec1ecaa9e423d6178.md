## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7a86f951-e11f-924c-2eb1-10dfadc8efe8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 273–282.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integral_condExp_indicator [mβ : MeasurableSpace β] {Y : α → β} (hY : Measurable Y)
    [SigmaFinite (μ.trim hY.comap_le)] {A : Set α} (hA : MeasurableSet A) :
    ∫ x, (μ[(A.indicator fun _ ↦ (1 : ℝ)) | mβ.comap Y]) x ∂μ = μ.real A := by
  rw [integral_condExp, integral_indicator hA, setIntegral_const, smul_eq_mul, mul_one]

@[deprecated (since := "2025-01-21")] alias integral_condexp_indicator := integral_condExp_indicator

/-- **Uniqueness of the conditional expectation**
If a function is a.e. `m`-measurable, verifies an integrability condition and has same integral
as `f` on all `m`-measurable sets, then it is a.e. equal to `μ[f|hm]`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant94554f4ee40323a877020c5ca1b33c7458b28717f66c45b9367f1e268983e570.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant94554f4ee40323a877020c5ca1b33c7458b28717f66c45b9367f1e268983e570.lean#L273).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fa5922acd49d9b1ea0c09e34c0306585b21db32c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
