## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:519d21b9d0f8ce66fe8bc2f422dcb76d94221d711dd9ac7bfe649041ac148cb6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 405–410.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def convergenceR (h : Integrable I l f vol) (ε : ℝ) : ℝ≥0 → ℝⁿ → Ioi (0 : ℝ) :=
  if hε : 0 < ε then (hasIntegral_iff.1 h.hasIntegral ε hε).choose
  else fun _ _ => ⟨1, Set.mem_Ioi.2 zero_lt_one⟩

variable {c c₁ c₂ : ℝ≥0} {ε ε₁ ε₂ : ℝ} {π₁ π₂ : TaggedPrepartition I}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant8b5b6eeb0d1756c5e1622149878e20c82675ff70685abdd68e21daea81bf742c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Basic/Variant8b5b6eeb0d1756c5e1622149878e20c82675ff70685abdd68e21daea81bf742c.lean#L405).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7e6b725797250d205876f963301327eb6bbc04ea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
