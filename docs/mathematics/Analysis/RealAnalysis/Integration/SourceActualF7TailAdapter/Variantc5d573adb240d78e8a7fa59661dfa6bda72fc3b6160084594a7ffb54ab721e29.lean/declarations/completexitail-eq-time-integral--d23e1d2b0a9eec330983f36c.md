## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:987dcfd6-51fe-01cf-a0ff-67902cff3d1b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 145–156.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem completeXiTail_eq_time_integral (A : ℝ) :
    completeXiTail A = ∫ t in Real.log 7..2 * A,
      timeXiDensity t * minusCorrelationWeight A t := by
  have he := intervalIntegral.integral_comp_mul_deriv_of_deriv_nonneg
    (a := Real.log 7) (b := 2 * A) (f := Real.exp) (f' := Real.exp)
    (g := actualTransformedXiBlockDensity A) Real.continuous_exp.continuousOn

  simp only [Function.comp_apply, actual_transformed_density_exp_mul,
    Real.exp_log (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) < 7)] at he
  exact he.symm

/-- Both traces vanish, so the complete tail has exactly zero boundary cost. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualF7TailAdapter/Variantc5d573adb240d78e8a7fa59661dfa6bda72fc3b6160084594a7ffb54ab721e29.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualF7TailAdapter/Variantc5d573adb240d78e8a7fa59661dfa6bda72fc3b6160084594a7ffb54ab721e29.lean#L145).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3a3641b8c05ea8e6ad20901fa4cd00a0a6b50cf5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
