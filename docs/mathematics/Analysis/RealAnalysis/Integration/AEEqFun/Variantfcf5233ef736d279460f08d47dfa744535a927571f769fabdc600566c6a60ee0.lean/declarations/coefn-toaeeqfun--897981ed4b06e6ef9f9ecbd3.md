## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:64d07a16-f085-7a5a-a28d-57faf2294c64`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 999–1008.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coeFn_toAEEqFun (f : C(α, β)) : f.toAEEqFun μ =ᵐ[μ] f :=
  AEEqFun.coeFn_mk f _
#align continuous_map.coe_fn_to_ae_eq_fun ContinuousMap.coeFn_toAEEqFun

variable [Group β] [TopologicalGroup β]

/-- The `MulHom` from the group of continuous maps from `α` to `β` to the group of equivalence
classes of `μ`-almost-everywhere measurable functions. -/
@[to_additive "The `AddHom` from the group of continuous maps from `α` to `β` to the group of
equivalence classes of `μ`-almost-everywhere measurable functions."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/AEEqFun/Variantfcf5233ef736d279460f08d47dfa744535a927571f769fabdc600566c6a60ee0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/AEEqFun/Variantfcf5233ef736d279460f08d47dfa744535a927571f769fabdc600566c6a60ee0.lean#L999).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `da3f364e9b6f02913a4c456ed87c250f51426478` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
