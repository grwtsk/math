## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d1b5030c4c63f800412f2310423e9e7277b6e107e1ea6ed43c41394745edc1f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 137–146.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def measurableEquivIco (a : ℝ) : AddCircle T ≃ᵐ Ico a (a + T) where
  toEquiv := equivIco T a
  measurable_toFun := measurable_of_measurable_on_compl_singleton _
    (continuousOn_iff_continuous_restrict.mp <| continuousOn_of_forall_continuousAt fun _x hx =>
      continuousAt_equivIco T a hx).measurable
  measurable_invFun := AddCircle.measurable_mk'.comp measurable_subtype_coe

attribute [local instance] Subtype.measureSpace in
/-- The lower integral of a function over `AddCircle T` is equal to the lower integral over an
interval (t, t + T] in `ℝ` of its lift to `ℝ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Periodic/Variant7ebee4e2ca182e12fd095145aa50321f2580fcad42ced4ff9009df0f3d8a6dc6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Periodic/Variant7ebee4e2ca182e12fd095145aa50321f2580fcad42ced4ff9009df0f3d8a6dc6.lean#L137).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b98d43e3ae423759ab05972f2cf37c281ff1e9c8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
