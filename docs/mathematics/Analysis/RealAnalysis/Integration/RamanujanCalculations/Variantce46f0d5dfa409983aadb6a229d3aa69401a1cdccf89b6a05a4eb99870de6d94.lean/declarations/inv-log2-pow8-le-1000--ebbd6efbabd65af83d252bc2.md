## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:34bd8123-3192-2857-cada-66b5e9ff81cc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 223–231.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem inv_log2_pow8_le_1000 : 1 / (log 2) ^ 8 ≤ (1000 : ℝ) := by
  have hhalf : (1 / 2 : ℝ) ≤ log 2 :=
    (show ∀ z ∈ Set.Icc (2 : ℝ) 2, (1 / 2 : ℝ) ≤ log z by interval_bound 20)
      2 ⟨le_refl _, le_refl _⟩
  calc 1 / (log 2) ^ 8
      ≤ 1 / (1 / 2 : ℝ) ^ 8 :=
        one_div_le_one_div_of_le (by positivity) (pow_le_pow_left₀ (by norm_num) hhalf 8)
    _ ≤ (1000 : ℝ) := by norm_num

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/RamanujanCalculations/Variantce46f0d5dfa409983aadb6a229d3aa69401a1cdccf89b6a05a4eb99870de6d94.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/RamanujanCalculations/Variantce46f0d5dfa409983aadb6a229d3aa69401a1cdccf89b6a05a4eb99870de6d94.lean#L223).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `570e76c38ddee829cb5740278651fdf506e91cdb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
