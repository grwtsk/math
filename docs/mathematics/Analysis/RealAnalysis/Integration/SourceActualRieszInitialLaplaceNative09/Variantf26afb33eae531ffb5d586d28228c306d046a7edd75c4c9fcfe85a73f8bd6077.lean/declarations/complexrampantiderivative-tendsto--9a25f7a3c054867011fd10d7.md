## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1fa38e19-89a1-04f3-c5a7-9547a1efdd3f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 163–176.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    Tendsto (complexRampAntiderivative z a) atTop (𝓝 0) := by
  have h0 := complex_exp_monomial_zero hz 0
  have h1 := complex_exp_monomial_zero hz 1
  have h := (((h1.sub (h0.const_mul (a : ℂ))).div_const z).add
    (h0.div_const (z^2))).neg

/-- The genuine single closed ramp has its exact initial improper transform. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualRieszInitialLaplaceNative09/Variantf26afb33eae531ffb5d586d28228c306d046a7edd75c4c9fcfe85a73f8bd6077.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SourceActualRieszInitialLaplaceNative09/Variantf26afb33eae531ffb5d586d28228c306d046a7edd75c4c9fcfe85a73f8bd6077.lean#L163).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b4dc5e9f4373a233442f95e7dce6c8d55c0532db` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
