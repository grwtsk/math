## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2e03b6b2-f12c-114f-7172-edb343752c13`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 425–432.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma integral_vHatR_sq_mul_cos (y : ℝ) :
    ∫ r, vHatR v r ^ 2 * Real.cos (r * y) = 2 * π * Av v y :=
  Taper.integral_mul_cos_of_paperFT_eq (A := Av v) (G := fun r => vHatR v r ^ 2)
    (Taper.autocorr_continuous_of_even hW.even hW.continuous hW.hasCompactSupport)
    (Taper.autocorr_integrable_of_even hW.even hW.continuous hW.hasCompactSupport)
    hW.integrable_vHatR_sq
    (fun r => by rw [← hW.vHatR_sq_eq r]; push_cast; ring) y

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/WindowCore/Variantbd2932caa6559633d2bf9eec7f23742705b8637c1dea2e837880eaa1f4c642b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/WindowCore/Variantbd2932caa6559633d2bf9eec7f23742705b8637c1dea2e837880eaa1f4c642b9.lean#L425).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `26cafb1155e10c7fab98568ead73e08cc2b3d778` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
