## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1cb71d01-067f-a5ff-8ef1-1b0f2a9e5328`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 252–268.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

section Mul

/-- Change of variables, general form for scalar functions. If `f` is continuous on `[a, b]` and has
continuous right-derivative `f'` in `(a, b)`, `g` is continuous on `f '' (a, b)` and integrable on
`f '' [a, b]`, and `(g ∘ f) x * f' x` is integrable on `[a, b]`, then we can substitute `u = f x`
to get `∫ x in a..b, (g ∘ f) x * f' x = ∫ u in f a..f b, g u`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/IntegrationByParts/Variant05da86666bece42861f5ac1a33ded3b81165c4bccdc1e2bd1c0a591fd79f8db8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/IntegrationByParts/Variant05da86666bece42861f5ac1a33ded3b81165c4bccdc1e2bd1c0a591fd79f8db8.lean#L252).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a2eb13a246a8408f166a396fb79e83f25da79f6f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
