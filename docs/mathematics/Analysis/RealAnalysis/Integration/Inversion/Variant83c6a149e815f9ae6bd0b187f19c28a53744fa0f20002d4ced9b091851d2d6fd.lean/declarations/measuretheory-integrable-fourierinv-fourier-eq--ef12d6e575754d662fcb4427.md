## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e9ef95e3-774a-ef99-eade-e984f493368c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 173–181.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem MeasureTheory.Integrable.fourierInv_fourier_eq
    (hf : Integrable f) (h'f : Integrable (𝓕 f)) {v : V}
    (hv : ContinuousAt f v) : 𝓕⁻ (𝓕 f) v = f v :=
  tendsto_nhds_unique (Real.tendsto_integral_gaussian_smul hf h'f v)
    (Real.tendsto_integral_gaussian_smul' hf hv)

/-- **Fourier inversion formula**: If a function `f` on a finite-dimensional real inner product
space is continuous, integrable, and its Fourier transform `𝓕 f` is also integrable,
then `𝓕⁻ (𝓕 f) = f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Inversion/Variant83c6a149e815f9ae6bd0b187f19c28a53744fa0f20002d4ced9b091851d2d6fd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Inversion/Variant83c6a149e815f9ae6bd0b187f19c28a53744fa0f20002d4ced9b091851d2d6fd.lean#L173).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `647c4ae99cf740ee52416b580d38153804e507a7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
