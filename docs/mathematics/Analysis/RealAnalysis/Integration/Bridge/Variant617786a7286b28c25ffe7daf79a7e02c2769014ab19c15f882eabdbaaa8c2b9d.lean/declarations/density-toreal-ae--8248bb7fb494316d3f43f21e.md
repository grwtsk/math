## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9dd2f59e-3a42-0a89-e290-d2ce9816ec40`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 105–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem density_toReal_ae
    (C : ℝ)
    (hpos : ∀ A : ℝ, 1 ≤ A → 0 ≤ correctedSource C A) :
    ∀ᵐ A ∂baseMeasure,
      (ENNReal.ofReal (correctedSource C A)).toReal =
        correctedSource C A := by
  filter_upwards [ae_restrict_mem measurableSet_Ioi]
    with A hA
  exact ENNReal.toReal_ofReal (hpos A hA.le)

/-- Every point seen by the positive source measure lies above radius one. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Bridge/Variant617786a7286b28c25ffe7daf79a7e02c2769014ab19c15f882eabdbaaa8c2b9d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Bridge/Variant617786a7286b28c25ffe7daf79a7e02c2769014ab19c15f882eabdbaaa8c2b9d.lean#L105).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7fe14de2b83f50fe6d39b0b0565b2a5150dad686` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
