## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:febafbbf7b3610f1cb17a5f3d2ca8d3c87b2bea2bf8ea8f849abad2655d2ca1f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 998–1005.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def LpToLpRestrictCLM (μ : Measure X) (p : ℝ≥0∞) [hp : Fact (1 ≤ p)] (s : Set X) :
    Lp F p μ →L[𝕜] Lp F p (μ.restrict s) :=
  @LinearMap.mkContinuous 𝕜 𝕜 (Lp F p μ) (Lp F p (μ.restrict s)) _ _ _ _ _ _ (RingHom.id 𝕜)
    ⟨⟨fun f => MemLp.toLp f ((Lp.memLp f).restrict s), fun f g => Lp_toLp_restrict_add f g s⟩,
      fun c f => Lp_toLp_restrict_smul c f s⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Set/Variant6f72e6c2a2ab3173fe6c51896535196ce5df3ab93bccb9c2237e84fd850108ea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Set/Variant6f72e6c2a2ab3173fe6c51896535196ce5df3ab93bccb9c2237e84fd850108ea.lean#L998).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c2f23b4ffdeaafa6c1e4faf7407788f785400da8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
