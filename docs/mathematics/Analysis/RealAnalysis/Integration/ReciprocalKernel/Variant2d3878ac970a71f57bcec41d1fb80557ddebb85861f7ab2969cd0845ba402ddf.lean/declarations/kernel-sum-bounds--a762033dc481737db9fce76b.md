## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cec86108-b503-c5b4-11bd-e475f08f7912`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 163–174.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem kernel_sum_bounds (b a : ℝ) (ha : 0 < a) :
    0 ≤ (∑' n : ℕ, kernel b (n + a)) - Real.log (1 + b ^ 2 * (a⁻¹) ^ 2) / 2 ∧
    (∑' n : ℕ, kernel b (n + a)) - Real.log (1 + b ^ 2 * (a⁻¹) ^ 2) / 2 ≤
      kernel b a := by
  have h := decreasing_sum_bounds (shifted_kernel_antitone b a ha)
    (shifted_kernel_integrable b a ha)
    (fun x hx => kernel_nonneg b (x + a) (add_pos hx ha))
  rw [shifted_kernel_integral b a ha] at h
  simp only [zero_add] at h
  constructor <;> linarith [h.1, h.2]

/-- The exact constant-four source bound, including `b = 0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ReciprocalKernel/Variant2d3878ac970a71f57bcec41d1fb80557ddebb85861f7ab2969cd0845ba402ddf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/ReciprocalKernel/Variant2d3878ac970a71f57bcec41d1fb80557ddebb85861f7ab2969cd0845ba402ddf.lean#L163).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7e3d9cec73f185cbced950be61c011878c93f835` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
