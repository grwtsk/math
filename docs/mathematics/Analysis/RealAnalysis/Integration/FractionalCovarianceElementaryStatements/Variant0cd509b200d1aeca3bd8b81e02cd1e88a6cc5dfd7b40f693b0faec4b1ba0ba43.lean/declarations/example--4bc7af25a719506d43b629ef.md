## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9dfdcd16141299324e8fd1e7e0982331f0aa502fb54552913a213cd15c5f42b7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 149–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example (d e : ℝ) (hd : 0 < d) (he : 0 < e) :
    IntegrableOn (fun x : ℝ => Int.fract (x / d) * Int.fract (x / e) / x ^ 2)
      (Ioi (0 : ℝ)) := by
  exact FractionalCovarianceElementaryScratch.fractional_product_integrable d e hd he

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FractionalCovarianceElementaryStatements/Variant0cd509b200d1aeca3bd8b81e02cd1e88a6cc5dfd7b40f693b0faec4b1ba0ba43.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FractionalCovarianceElementaryStatements/Variant0cd509b200d1aeca3bd8b81e02cd1e88a6cc5dfd7b40f693b0faec4b1ba0ba43.lean#L149).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ccb1694431fd57b0a5f5a980b30bff2b698b0c79` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
