## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:308a5fd2-6419-6754-8028-9915608b2160`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 135–147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem normalization_admissibility_iff :
    NormalizationAdmissibilityObligation ↔
      LogarithmicIntegrabilityObligation ∧ ArchimedeanIntegrabilityObligation := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    exact ⟨fun A hA ↦ (h A hA).2.1.2.2, fun A hA ↦ (h A hA).2.2.1⟩
  · rintro ⟨hlog, harch⟩ A hA
    exact ⟨BridgeNormalization.explicit_normalization A hA,
      ⟨actual_memLp A hA, actual_support A hA, hlog A hA⟩,
      harch A hA, actual_form_eq_source_scalar A hA⟩

/-- With the logarithmic domain now proved, genuine archimedean integrability
is precisely the remaining B3.1 gate. This equivalence does not prove that gate. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/BridgeAdmissibility/Variantcb4098f1daa3690cf2227b665b7caf90d2ea3d172f960faeeeb8751f6c5f4280.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/BridgeAdmissibility/Variantcb4098f1daa3690cf2227b665b7caf90d2ea3d172f960faeeeb8751f6c5f4280.lean#L135).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `86459c9dc75b5d5fb6b9d25da7d6b06dc649a755` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
