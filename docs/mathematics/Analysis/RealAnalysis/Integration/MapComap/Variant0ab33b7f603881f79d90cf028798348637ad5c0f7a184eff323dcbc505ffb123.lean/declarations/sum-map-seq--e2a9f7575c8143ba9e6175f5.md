## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eeecb574-5b01-5217-2e0f-6c520bc10577`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–121.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sum_map_seq (κ : Kernel α β) [IsSFiniteKernel κ] (f : β → γ) :
    (Kernel.sum fun n => map (seq κ n) f) = map κ f := by
  by_cases hf : Measurable f
  · ext a s hs
    rw [Kernel.sum_apply, map_apply' κ hf a hs, Measure.sum_apply _ hs, ← measure_sum_seq κ,
      Measure.sum_apply _ (hf hs)]
    simp_rw [map_apply' _ hf _ hs]
  · simp [map_of_not_measurable _ hf]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MapComap/Variant0ab33b7f603881f79d90cf028798348637ad5c0f7a184eff323dcbc505ffb123.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/MapComap/Variant0ab33b7f603881f79d90cf028798348637ad5c0f7a184eff323dcbc505ffb123.lean#L113).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d3045452134ddc322dc4172e827c6dc69f1b75f1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
