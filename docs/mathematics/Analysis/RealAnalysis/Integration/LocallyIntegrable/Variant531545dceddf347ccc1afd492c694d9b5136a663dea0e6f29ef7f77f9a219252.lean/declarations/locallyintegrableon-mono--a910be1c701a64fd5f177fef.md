## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8c1800f9-c699-9f20-6c35-38cd7ae45db0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–66.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem LocallyIntegrableOn.mono (hf : LocallyIntegrableOn f s μ) {g : X → F}
    (hg : AEStronglyMeasurable g μ) (h : ∀ᵐ x ∂μ, ‖g x‖ ≤ ‖f x‖) :
    LocallyIntegrableOn g s μ := by
  intro x hx
  rcases hf x hx with ⟨t, t_mem, ht⟩
  exact ⟨t, t_mem, Integrable.mono ht hg.restrict (ae_restrict_of_ae h)⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LocallyIntegrable/Variant531545dceddf347ccc1afd492c694d9b5136a663dea0e6f29ef7f77f9a219252.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/LocallyIntegrable/Variant531545dceddf347ccc1afd492c694d9b5136a663dea0e6f29ef7f77f9a219252.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `88fca606a67b4b3d14794fc42980aa6fa98a3c6c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
