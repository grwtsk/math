## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b1d54717-bebc-e60e-f3f6-f38f814da47e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 211–224.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma Ix_length {x : ℝ} :
    min (2 * T - x) (2 * T) - max (T - x) T = T - |x| := by
  rcases le_or_gt 0 x with h | h
  · rw [abs_of_nonneg h, min_eq_left (by linarith), max_eq_right (by linarith)]; ring
  · rw [abs_of_neg h, min_eq_right (by linarith), max_eq_left (by linarith)]; ring

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PPKernel/Variant1dfe683690a0f47ff5263e5bb1a619682cd33cb36a31d74cc2b8ecc416f57fd4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/PPKernel/Variant1dfe683690a0f47ff5263e5bb1a619682cd33cb36a31d74cc2b8ecc416f57fd4.lean#L211).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c75669277cd28f7712457d57bb96fdc692ec435` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
