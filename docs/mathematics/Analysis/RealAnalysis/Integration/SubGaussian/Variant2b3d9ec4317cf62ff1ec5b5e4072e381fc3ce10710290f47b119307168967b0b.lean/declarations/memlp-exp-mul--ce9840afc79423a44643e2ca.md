## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4dcc4001-ecf0-d339-a288-3ab507ca5fa6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 175–189.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma memLp_exp_mul (h : HasSubgaussianMGF X c κ ν) (t : ℝ) (p : ℝ≥0) :
    MemLp (fun ω ↦ exp (t * X ω)) p (κ ∘ₘ ν) := by
  by_cases hp0 : p = 0
  · simpa [hp0] using (h.integrable_exp_mul t).1
  constructor
  · exact (h.integrable_exp_mul t).1
  · rw [eLpNorm_lt_top_iff_lintegral_rpow_enorm_lt_top (mod_cast hp0) (by simp)]
    simp only [ENNReal.coe_toReal]
    have h' := (h.integrable_exp_mul (p * t)).2
    rw [hasFiniteIntegral_def] at h'
    convert h' using 3 with ω
    rw [enorm_eq_ofReal (by positivity), enorm_eq_ofReal (by positivity),
      ENNReal.ofReal_rpow_of_nonneg (by positivity), ← exp_mul, mul_comm, ← mul_assoc]
    positivity

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SubGaussian/Variant2b3d9ec4317cf62ff1ec5b5e4072e381fc3ce10710290f47b119307168967b0b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/SubGaussian/Variant2b3d9ec4317cf62ff1ec5b5e4072e381fc3ce10710290f47b119307168967b0b.lean#L175).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f30fb70372fb70e2c30f4919426178cc4ee9c7ed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
