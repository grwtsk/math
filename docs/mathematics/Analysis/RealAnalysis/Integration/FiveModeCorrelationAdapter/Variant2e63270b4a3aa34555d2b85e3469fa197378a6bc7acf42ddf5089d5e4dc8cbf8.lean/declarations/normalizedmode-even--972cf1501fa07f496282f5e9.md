## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ab2b63e1-334e-c87a-65a4-dccd3e157909`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem normalizedMode_even (A x : ℝ) (i : Fin 5) :
    normalizedMode A i (-x) = normalizedMode A i x := by
  by_cases hx : x ∈ Icc (-A) A
  · have hn : -x ∈ Icc (-A) A := ⟨by linarith [hx.2], by linarith [hx.1]⟩
    simp only [normalizedMode, indicator_of_mem hx, indicator_of_mem hn, neg_div, mode_even]
  · have hn : -x ∉ Icc (-A) A := by
      intro hn
      exact hx ⟨by linarith [hn.2], by linarith [hn.1]⟩
    simp only [normalizedMode, indicator_of_notMem hx, indicator_of_notMem hn]

/-- Reflection proves evenness of every actual cross-correlation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FiveModeCorrelationAdapter/Variant2e63270b4a3aa34555d2b85e3469fa197378a6bc7acf42ddf5089d5e4dc8cbf8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FiveModeCorrelationAdapter/Variant2e63270b4a3aa34555d2b85e3469fa197378a6bc7acf42ddf5089d5e4dc8cbf8.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d9a071e72df9dc3982087218e596d7c9c6d74da` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
