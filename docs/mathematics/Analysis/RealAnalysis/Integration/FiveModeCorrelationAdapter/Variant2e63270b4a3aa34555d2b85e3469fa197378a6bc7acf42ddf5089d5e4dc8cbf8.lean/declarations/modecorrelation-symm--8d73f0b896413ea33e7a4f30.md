## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:25dd5267-7585-3848-07e0-df57350ee2ba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 140–149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem modeCorrelation_symm (A t : ℝ) (i j : Fin 5) :
    modeCorrelation A i j t = modeCorrelation A j i t := by
  have h := integral_sub_right_eq_self (μ := volume) (fun x : ℝ =>
    normalizedMode A i x * normalizedMode A j (x- -t)) t
  have hs : modeCorrelation A j i t = modeCorrelation A i j (-t) := by
    simpa only [modeCorrelation, sub_neg_eq_add, sub_add_cancel, mul_comm] using h
  rw [modeCorrelation_even] at hs
  exact hs.symm

/-- Exact orthonormal origin values for the actual normalized basis. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FiveModeCorrelationAdapter/Variant2e63270b4a3aa34555d2b85e3469fa197378a6bc7acf42ddf5089d5e4dc8cbf8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FiveModeCorrelationAdapter/Variant2e63270b4a3aa34555d2b85e3469fa197378a6bc7acf42ddf5089d5e4dc8cbf8.lean#L140).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d9a071e72df9dc3982087218e596d7c9c6d74da` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
