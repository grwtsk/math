## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b4ddb5d6-4e05-502f-8519-614db63a2c61`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–97.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    Real.exp r * |deriv (logSample t) (Real.exp r)| =
      Real.exp (-r / 2) * |sampleDerivativeProfile (t - 1 - r)| := by
  rw [(logSample_hasDerivAt t (Real.exp r) (Real.exp_pos _)).deriv,
    Real.log_exp, abs_div, abs_mul, abs_of_pos (Real.exp_pos _), abs_of_pos (Real.exp_pos _)]
  field_simp

/-- The finite positive derivative budget of the prescribed source filter. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FixedKernelAdmissionAudit/Variant4015855160d771d0987f873e0e2a8f4723b07e90ddf5dd61d43fa62adb62bf15.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/FixedKernelAdmissionAudit/Variant4015855160d771d0987f873e0e2a8f4723b07e90ddf5dd61d43fa62adb62bf15.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bc7f2a6a4e05af82a89be0c7f2846cc2cfdbb731` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
