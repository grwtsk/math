## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:74c7d6bb-53f1-86cc-0b05-13a21ce1e6d6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 315–327.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma regularKernel_succ
    (k : ℕ) (w : ℂ) (hw : w ≠ 0) :
    regularKernel (k + 1) w =
      (Complex.exp (-w) +
        (k + 1 : ℕ) * regularKernel k w) / w := by
  rw [regularKernel, regularKernel, headIntegral_succ k w hw,
    Nat.factorial_succ, pow_succ]
  push_cast
  field_simp [hw]
  ring

/-- The finite-interval regular-part expression equals the same continued
kernel for every nonzero complex argument. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Kernel/Variantcd67141c4a5122693dcbb8c4145d38d359228bb335afe48059ed3a9c77c0a62b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Kernel/Variantcd67141c4a5122693dcbb8c4145d38d359228bb335afe48059ed3a9c77c0a62b.lean#L315).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `17d67e9f4dd960a0ad958f13b18f253153d75489` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
