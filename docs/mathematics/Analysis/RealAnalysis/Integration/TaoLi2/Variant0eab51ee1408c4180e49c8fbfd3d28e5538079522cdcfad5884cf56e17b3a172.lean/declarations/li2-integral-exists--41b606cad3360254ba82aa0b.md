## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:de90ce88-162e-06f5-1c12-c7e64ddb0df9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 328–343.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem li2_integral_exists : True := trivial  -- Placeholder for full integral theorem

/-! ### Connection to Tao's PNT formalization

These bounds enable:
1. **PNT#758**: Prove li(x) = Li(x) + li(2)
   - The symmetric form shows the principal value integral is well-defined
   - The bound |g(t)| ≤ 2 ensures absolute convergence

2. **PNT#759**: Verify li(2) ≈ 1.0451
   - Numerical integration of g(t) on [0, 1]
   - Taylor model bounds give certified error

3. **PNT#764-768**: The sublemmas for the above
   - All the log bounds proven here feed into these
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/TaoLi2/Variant0eab51ee1408c4180e49c8fbfd3d28e5538079522cdcfad5884cf56e17b3a172.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/TaoLi2/Variant0eab51ee1408c4180e49c8fbfd3d28e5538079522cdcfad5884cf56e17b3a172.lean#L328).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee0a3235dff71c7a8c2d22b9cbfc63502feb29bf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
