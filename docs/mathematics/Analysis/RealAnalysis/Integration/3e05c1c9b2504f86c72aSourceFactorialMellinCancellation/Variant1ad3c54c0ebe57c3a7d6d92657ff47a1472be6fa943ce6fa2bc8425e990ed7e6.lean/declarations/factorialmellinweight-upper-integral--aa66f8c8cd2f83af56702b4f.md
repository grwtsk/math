## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c616dac9-0b44-2a47-b749-e17fb089dd88`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 345–362.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem factorialMellinWeight_upper_integral :
    (∫ y in Ioi (1 : ℝ), factorialMellinWeight y) =
      2 + 2 * (∫ y in Ioi (1 : ℝ), coefficientWeight 0 y) -
        (∫ y in Ioi (1 : ℝ), coefficientWeight 1 y) := by

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/3e05c1c9b2504f86c72aSourceFactorialMellinCancellation/Variant1ad3c54c0ebe57c3a7d6d92657ff47a1472be6fa943ce6fa2bc8425e990ed7e6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/3e05c1c9b2504f86c72aSourceFactorialMellinCancellation/Variant1ad3c54c0ebe57c3a7d6d92657ff47a1472be6fa943ce6fa2bc8425e990ed7e6.lean#L345).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f4e86d1cff60b3d9e6d79a798c3faf444c17a8e6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
