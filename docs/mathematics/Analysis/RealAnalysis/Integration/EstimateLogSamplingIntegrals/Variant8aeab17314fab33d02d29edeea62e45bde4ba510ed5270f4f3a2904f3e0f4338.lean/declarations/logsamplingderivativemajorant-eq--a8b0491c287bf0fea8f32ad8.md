## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8fba8502-cad3-654e-0114-09a717901204`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–145.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem logSamplingDerivativeMajorant_eq
    (x B0 B1 u : ℝ) :
    logSamplingDerivativeMajorant x B0 B1 u =
      Real.exp (-Real.log x / 2) *
        (B0 * halfDensity u +
          (B0 / 2 + B1) * logHalfDensity u) := by
  unfold logSamplingDerivativeMajorant
  unfold logHalfDensity halfDensity
  ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/EstimateLogSamplingIntegrals/Variant8aeab17314fab33d02d29edeea62e45bde4ba510ed5270f4f3a2904f3e0f4338.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/EstimateLogSamplingIntegrals/Variant8aeab17314fab33d02d29edeea62e45bde4ba510ed5270f4f3a2904f3e0f4338.lean#L136).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
