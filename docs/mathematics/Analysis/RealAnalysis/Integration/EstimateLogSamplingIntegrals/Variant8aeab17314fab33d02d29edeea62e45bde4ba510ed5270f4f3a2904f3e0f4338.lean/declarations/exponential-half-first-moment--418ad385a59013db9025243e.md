## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d1618c8f-c14d-c316-cc29-3c313ff87a46`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–65.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exponential_half_first_moment :
    (∫ r in Ioi (0 : ℝ),
      r * Real.exp (-r / 2)) = 4 := by
  have h :=
    Real.integral_rpow_mul_exp_neg_mul_Ioi
      (a := (2 : ℝ)) (r := (1 / 2 : ℝ))
      (by norm_num) (by norm_num)
  have hGamma :
      Real.Gamma (2 : ℝ) = 1 := by
    norm_num [Real.Gamma_nat_eq_factorial]
  norm_num [hGamma, div_eq_mul_inv, mul_comm] at h ⊢
  exact h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/EstimateLogSamplingIntegrals/Variant8aeab17314fab33d02d29edeea62e45bde4ba510ed5270f4f3a2904f3e0f4338.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/EstimateLogSamplingIntegrals/Variant8aeab17314fab33d02d29edeea62e45bde4ba510ed5270f4f3a2904f3e0f4338.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `863df8875532dc674778c02d469904cff6fe8bd2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
