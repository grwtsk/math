## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:150e318d-77c8-07f3-f1ff-37aaea5b6c3d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 81–96.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isIntegral_of_exists_lift {W : WeierstrassCurve K}
    (h₁ : ∃ r₁, (algebraMap R K) r₁ = W.a₁)
    (h₂ : ∃ r₂, (algebraMap R K) r₂ = W.a₂)
    (h₃ : ∃ r₃, (algebraMap R K) r₃ = W.a₃)
    (h₄ : ∃ r₄, (algebraMap R K) r₄ = W.a₄)
    (h₆ : ∃ r₆, (algebraMap R K) r₆ = W.a₆) :
    IsIntegral R W := by
  use ⟨h₁.choose, h₂.choose, h₃.choose, h₄.choose, h₆.choose⟩

  · apply h₃.choose_spec.symm

  · apply h₆.choose_spec.symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Reduction/Variant0af4f682a8730874fb0a3f8483a200882000cac75c863859d5710d993ac49173.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/Integration/Reduction/Variant0af4f682a8730874fb0a3f8483a200882000cac75c863859d5710d993ac49173.lean#L81).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d2a14bce2719c1612afaf5a6791e75c827763cc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
