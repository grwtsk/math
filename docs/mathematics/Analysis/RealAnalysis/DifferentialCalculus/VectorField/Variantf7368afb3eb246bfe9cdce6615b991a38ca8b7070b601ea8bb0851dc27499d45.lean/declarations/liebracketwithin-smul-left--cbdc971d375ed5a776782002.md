## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8c7e5d82-474e-5553-9128-9027a2358419`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 156–167.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma lieBracketWithin_smul_left {f : E → 𝕜} (hf : DifferentiableWithinAt 𝕜 f s x)
    (hV : DifferentiableWithinAt 𝕜 V s x) (hs : UniqueDiffWithinAt 𝕜 s x) :
    lieBracketWithin 𝕜 (fun y ↦ f y • V y) W s x =
      - (fderivWithin 𝕜 f s x) (W x) • (V x) + (f x) • lieBracketWithin 𝕜 V W s x := by
  rw [lieBracketWithin_swap, Pi.neg_apply, lieBracketWithin_smul_right hf hV hs,
    lieBracketWithin_swap, add_comm]

Product rule for Lie Brackets: given two vector fields `V W : E → E` and a function `f : E → 𝕜`,
we have `[f • V, W] = - (df W) • V + f • [V, W]`
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/VectorField/Variantf7368afb3eb246bfe9cdce6615b991a38ca8b7070b601ea8bb0851dc27499d45.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/VectorField/Variantf7368afb3eb246bfe9cdce6615b991a38ca8b7070b601ea8bb0851dc27499d45.lean#L156).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e2552e1d8be91b5a59d4844051626c460ac83cb7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
