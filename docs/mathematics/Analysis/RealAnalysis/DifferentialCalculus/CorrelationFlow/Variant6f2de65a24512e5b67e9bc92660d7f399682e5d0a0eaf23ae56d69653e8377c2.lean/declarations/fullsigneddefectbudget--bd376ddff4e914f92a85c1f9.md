## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d0656179d03595f79391f12bbfaa8bf14b9a42fa72c3f0d10b82c19c5e4da3f0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 201–209.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def FullSignedDefectBudget
    (flow : ResidualAwareCorrelationFlow (Left := Left) (Right := Right))
    (budget : ℝ) : Prop :=
  0 ≤ budget ∧ ∀ t x, 0 ≤ t → t ≤ flow.finalTime →
    ‖flow.fullSignedDerivative t x‖ ≤ budget

/-- The endpoint change is derived from the exact differential equation and
a derivative budget by the Banach-valued mean-value inequality. -/
@[surface_novel, surface_published]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/CorrelationFlow/Variant6f2de65a24512e5b67e9bc92660d7f399682e5d0a0eaf23ae56d69653e8377c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/CorrelationFlow/Variant6f2de65a24512e5b67e9bc92660d7f399682e5d0a0eaf23ae56d69653e8377c2.lean#L201).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b1ce0e56662f34347586ba7f01c40a6342a58cee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
