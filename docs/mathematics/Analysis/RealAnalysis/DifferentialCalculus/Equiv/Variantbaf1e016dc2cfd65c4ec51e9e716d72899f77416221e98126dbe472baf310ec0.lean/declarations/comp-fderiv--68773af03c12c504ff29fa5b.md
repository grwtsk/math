## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4d29682f-a9e0-ab8c-9892-e28278d3061a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 354–366.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem comp_fderiv {f : G → E} {x : G} :
    fderiv 𝕜 (iso ∘ f) x = (iso : E →L[𝕜] F).comp (fderiv 𝕜 f x) :=
  (iso : E ≃L[𝕜] F).comp_fderiv
#align linear_isometry_equiv.comp_fderiv LinearIsometryEquiv.comp_fderiv

end LinearIsometryEquiv

/-- If `f (g y) = y` for `y` in some neighborhood of `a`, `g` is continuous at `a`, and `f` has an
invertible derivative `f'` at `g a` in the strict sense, then `g` has the derivative `f'⁻¹` at `a`
in the strict sense.

This is one of the easy parts of the inverse function theorem: it assumes that we already have an
inverse function. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Equiv/Variantbaf1e016dc2cfd65c4ec51e9e716d72899f77416221e98126dbe472baf310ec0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Equiv/Variantbaf1e016dc2cfd65c4ec51e9e716d72899f77416221e98126dbe472baf310ec0.lean#L354).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `18fdffc1134922d0fe471ae56cdec78fd2355d5b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
