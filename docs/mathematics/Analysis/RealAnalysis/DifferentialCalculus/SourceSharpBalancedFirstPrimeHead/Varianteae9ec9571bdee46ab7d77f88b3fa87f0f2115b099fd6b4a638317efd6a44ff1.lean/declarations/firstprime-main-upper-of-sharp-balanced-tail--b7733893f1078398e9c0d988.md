## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e9a5e094-7d4e-ee08-6cc4-2fbc17d469b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 213–225.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem firstPrime_main_upper_of_sharp_balanced_tail {K Q A : ℝ}
    (hQ : 91 ≤ Q) (hQA : Q ≤ A) (htail : -K ≤ balancedFirstPrimeTailWork A) :
    firstPrimeMoment A + diagonalMainCoefficient A * A ≤
      sharpBalancedFirstPrimeReturnCost K Q := by
  have hA : 1 ≤ A := by linarith
  have hcont := (abs_le.mp (criticalContinuousMoment_abs_le_two A hA)).2
  have hzero := (abs_le.mp (firstPrimeZeroHead_abs_le_at_radius hQ hQA)).1
  have hhead := (abs_le.mp (balancedFirstPrimeHead_abs_le_sharp_at_radius hQ hQA)).1
  rw [firstPrime_main_eq_balanced_source A hA,
    balanced_full_eq_head_add_tail A (by linarith : 0 < A)]
  unfold sharpBalancedFirstPrimeReturnCost
  linarith only [hcont, hzero, hhead, htail]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceSharpBalancedFirstPrimeHead/Varianteae9ec9571bdee46ab7d77f88b3fa87f0f2115b099fd6b4a638317efd6a44ff1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceSharpBalancedFirstPrimeHead/Varianteae9ec9571bdee46ab7d77f88b3fa87f0f2115b099fd6b4a638317efd6a44ff1.lean#L213).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dffd654e5678bff20ce8613335f49036e560ec6a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
