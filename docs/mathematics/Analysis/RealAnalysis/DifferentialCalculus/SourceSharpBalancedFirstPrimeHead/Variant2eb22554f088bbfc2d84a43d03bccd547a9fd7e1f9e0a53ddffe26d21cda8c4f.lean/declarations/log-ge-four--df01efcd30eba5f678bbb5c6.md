## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:df279bbf-bc0a-d8e0-2a84-a022245472f4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem log_ge_four {A : ℝ} (hA : 91 ≤ A) : 4 ≤ Real.log A := by
  have he : Real.exp (4 : ℝ) < 81 := by
    have hp := pow_lt_pow_left₀ Real.exp_one_lt_three (Real.exp_pos (1 : ℝ)).le
      (by norm_num : (4 : ℕ) ≠ 0)
    have hh : Real.exp (4 : ℝ) = Real.exp 1 ^ 4 := by
      rw [← Real.exp_nat_mul]
      norm_num
    rw [hh]
    norm_num at hp ⊢
    exact hp
  exact (Real.le_log_iff_exp_le (by linarith : 0 < A)).mpr (by linarith)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceSharpBalancedFirstPrimeHead/Variant2eb22554f088bbfc2d84a43d03bccd547a9fd7e1f9e0a53ddffe26d21cda8c4f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceSharpBalancedFirstPrimeHead/Variant2eb22554f088bbfc2d84a43d03bccd547a9fd7e1f9e0a53ddffe26d21cda8c4f.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c82168991b79f26b65db367031ad1eef8590b14f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
