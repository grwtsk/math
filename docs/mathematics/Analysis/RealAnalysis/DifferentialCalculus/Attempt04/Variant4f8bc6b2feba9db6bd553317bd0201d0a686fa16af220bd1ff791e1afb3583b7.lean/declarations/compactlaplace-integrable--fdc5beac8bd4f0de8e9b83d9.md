## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6f93b98f-0200-409d-ee00-3861b3c91a06`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 37–43.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem compactLaplace_integrable (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : Continuous f)
    (hs : HasCompactSupport f) (z : ℂ) :
    Integrable (fun x : ℝ => (f x : ℂ) * Complex.exp (z * (x : ℂ))) := by
  have hc : Continuous (fun x : ℝ => (f x : ℂ) * Complex.exp (z * (x : ℂ))) := by fun_prop
  exact hc.integrable_of_hasCompactSupport
    ((hs.comp_left (show Complex.ofReal (0 : ℝ) = 0 by simp)).mul_right)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Attempt04/Variant4f8bc6b2feba9db6bd553317bd0201d0a686fa16af220bd1ff791e1afb3583b7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Attempt04/Variant4f8bc6b2feba9db6bd553317bd0201d0a686fa16af220bd1ff791e1afb3583b7.lean#L37).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb27fbc7e7e73c5b8b8a51ed69162c1105fdc2b1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
