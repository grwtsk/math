## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d6ed8a0afc4a0fd4eb67c1c182c9cad5d54bb805010281c41eaad5a893342558`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 134–149.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure InitialVelocityCondition (u₀ : ℝ^n → ℝ^n) : Prop where
  /-- The initial velocity field is divergence-free (equation 2).
      This is the incompressibility constraint for the fluid. -/
  div_free : ∀ x, ∇⬝ u₀ x = 0
  /-- The initial velocity field is smooth ($C^\infty$ in all variables). -/
  smooth : ContDiff ℝ ∞ u₀

/--
Initial velocity conditions for the Navier-Stokes problem on all of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

In addition to being smooth and divergence-free, the velocity must decay
faster than any polynomial at spatial infinity (condition 4 in Fefferman's paper).

This condition ensures the velocity field has finite energy and reasonable
behavior as $\lVert x \rVert \to \infty$.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/NavierStokes/Variant0cd193b8d5cbd0266e6e2f72e68dd5abcdcf2430ebd435dd9289737e9aa7da61.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/NavierStokes/Variant0cd193b8d5cbd0266e6e2f72e68dd5abcdcf2430ebd435dd9289737e9aa7da61.lean#L134).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `673fb19e26e60818d446363afd953f618719f99b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
