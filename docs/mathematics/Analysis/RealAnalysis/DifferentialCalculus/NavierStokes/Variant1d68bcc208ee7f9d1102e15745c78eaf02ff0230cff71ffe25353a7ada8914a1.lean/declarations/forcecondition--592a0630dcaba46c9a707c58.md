## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f71cfd39411cff0ea4f4855890485756311f13a298c3bcf0e04f8c4b5f9e8db7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 183–192.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ForceCondition (f : ℝ^n → ℝ → ℝ^n) : Prop where
  /-- The force is smooth on $\mathbb{R}^n \times [0,\infty)$. -/
  smooth : ContDiffOn ℝ ∞ (↿f) (Set.univ ×ˢ Set.Ici 0)

/--
Force conditions for the Navier-Stokes problem on all of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

The force must be smooth and decay faster than any polynomial
in both space and time (condition 5 in Fefferman's paper).
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/NavierStokes/Variant1d68bcc208ee7f9d1102e15745c78eaf02ff0230cff71ffe25353a7ada8914a1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/NavierStokes/Variant1d68bcc208ee7f9d1102e15745c78eaf02ff0230cff71ffe25353a7ada8914a1.lean#L183).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `38096ec925d30a439bac43c870652ca158185b11` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
