## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:682aeb60-c74d-dea3-d81c-b42320ac3cb3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 119–128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  rw [divergence, fderiv_fun_const_smul hv c]
  simp [divergence]

/--
A function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \alpha$ is 1-periodic if it is periodic in each
coordinate with period $1$, i.e. $f(x + e_i) = f(x)$ for each unit vector $e_i$.
This captures functions on the $n$-torus $\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/NavierStokes/Variant1d68bcc208ee7f9d1102e15745c78eaf02ff0230cff71ffe25353a7ada8914a1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/NavierStokes/Variant1d68bcc208ee7f9d1102e15745c78eaf02ff0230cff71ffe25353a7ada8914a1.lean#L119).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `38096ec925d30a439bac43c870652ca158185b11` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
