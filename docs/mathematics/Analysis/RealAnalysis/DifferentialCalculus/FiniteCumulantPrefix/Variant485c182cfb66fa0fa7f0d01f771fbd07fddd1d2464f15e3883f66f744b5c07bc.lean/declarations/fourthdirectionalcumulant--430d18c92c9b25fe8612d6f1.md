## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fbeb5218cc9c8be406ff30d81f029fcf88f5f833bc0b5d785b43aaa24ac00bba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–68.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def fourthDirectionalCumulant
    (theta : E) (directions : Fin 4 → E) : ℝ :=
  F.fourthCumulantCovector theta
    (directions 0) (directions 1) (directions 2) (directions 3)

/-- Total order-indexed family containing the verified finite cumulant prefix.

Orders outside 1--4 are set to zero only so that this object inhabits the
all-orders interface. No mathematical claim is made about those entries. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/FiniteCumulantPrefix/Variant485c182cfb66fa0fa7f0d01f771fbd07fddd1d2464f15e3883f66f744b5c07bc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/FiniteCumulantPrefix/Variant485c182cfb66fa0fa7f0d01f771fbd07fddd1d2464f15e3883f66f744b5c07bc.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `819b35aef974f3c22b9f88ab1efcd788602131e3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
