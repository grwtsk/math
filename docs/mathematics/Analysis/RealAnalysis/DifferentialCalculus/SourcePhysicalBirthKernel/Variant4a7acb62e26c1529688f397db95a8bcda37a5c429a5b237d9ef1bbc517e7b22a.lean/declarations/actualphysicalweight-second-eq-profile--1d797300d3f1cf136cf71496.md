## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:40e920ab-0295-26e3-b235-31ac471bce48`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 197–212.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem actualPhysicalWeight_second_eq_profile {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) :
    EqOn (deriv (deriv (actualPhysicalWeight A))) (deriv (deriv (physicalProfile A)))
      (Icc 0 (2 * A)) := by
  have hf := actualPhysicalWeight_contDiff hA
  have hg := physicalProfile_contDiff A
  apply deriv_eq_on_closed (by linarith)
  · have hf1 : ContDiff ℝ 1 (deriv (actualPhysicalWeight A)) := hf.deriv'

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourcePhysicalBirthKernel/Variant4a7acb62e26c1529688f397db95a8bcda37a5c429a5b237d9ef1bbc517e7b22a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourcePhysicalBirthKernel/Variant4a7acb62e26c1529688f397db95a8bcda37a5c429a5b237d9ef1bbc517e7b22a.lean#L197).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c3535ff185426f2b9bb75f39543e825c69c432f1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
