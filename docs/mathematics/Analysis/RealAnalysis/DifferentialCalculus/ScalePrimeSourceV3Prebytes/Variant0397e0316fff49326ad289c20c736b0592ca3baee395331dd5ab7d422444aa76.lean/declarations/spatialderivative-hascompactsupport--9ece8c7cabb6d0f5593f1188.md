## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5e400fd2-391d-e56a-94c5-d69d41551a57`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–102.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem spatialDerivative_hasCompactSupport {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) :
    HasCompactSupport (spatialDerivative A) := by
  apply HasCompactSupport.of_support_subset_isCompact (isCompact_Icc (a := -A) (b := A))
  intro x hx
  by_contra hm
  have ha : A ≤ |x| := by
    simp only [mem_Icc, not_and_or, not_le] at hm
    rcases hm with hm | hm
    · have hn : x < 0 := by linarith
      rw [abs_of_neg hn]
      linarith
    · exact hm.le.trans (le_abs_self _)
  exact hx (spatialDerivative_zero_of_le_abs hA ha)

/-- Actual real L² membership follows from continuity and compact support. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ScalePrimeSourceV3Prebytes/Variant0397e0316fff49326ad289c20c736b0592ca3baee395331dd5ab7d422444aa76.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ScalePrimeSourceV3Prebytes/Variant0397e0316fff49326ad289c20c736b0592ca3baee395331dd5ab7d422444aa76.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dd4db765e05b213420d2bb43ba60a2ccdc95395e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
