## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b087084a-b870-a58b-a3a5-c8dc0e06c821`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 327–360.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (h : HasFPowerSeriesWithinOnBall f p s x r)
    {f' : E →L[𝕜] F}
    {y : E} (hy : (‖y‖₊ : ℝ≥0∞) < r) (h'y : x + y ∈ insert x s)

    HasSum (fun n ↦ p.derivSeries n (fun _ ↦ y)) f' := by
  /- In the completion of the space, the derivative series is summable, and its sum is a derivative
  of the function. Therefore, by uniqueness of derivatives, its sum is the image of `f'` under
  the canonical embedding. As this is an embedding, it means that there was also convergence in
  the original space, to `f'`. -/

/-- If a function has a power series within a set on a ball, then so does its derivative. Version
assuming that the function is analytic on `s`. For a version without this assumption but requiring
that `F` is complete, see `HasFPowerSeriesWithinOnBall.fderivWithin_of_mem`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Analytic/Variant5d7907353e4db1dacf0ed9efb99f1e0140a3b64496c7582a9131660950aacab0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Analytic/Variant5d7907353e4db1dacf0ed9efb99f1e0140a3b64496c7582a9131660950aacab0.lean#L327).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
