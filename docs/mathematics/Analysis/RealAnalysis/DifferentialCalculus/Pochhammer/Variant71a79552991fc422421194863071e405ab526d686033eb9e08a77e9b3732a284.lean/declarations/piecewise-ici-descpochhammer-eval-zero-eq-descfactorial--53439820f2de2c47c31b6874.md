## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:129ec1e3-5db2-50bd-46b2-7b2d9072fddd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private lemma piecewise_Ici_descPochhammer_eval_zero_eq_descFactorial (k n : ℕ) :
    (Set.Ici (n - 1 : ℝ)).piecewise (descPochhammer ℝ n).eval 0 k
      = k.descFactorial n := by
  rw [Set.piecewise, descPochhammer_eval_eq_descFactorial, ite_eq_left_iff, Set.mem_Ici, not_le,
    eq_comm, Pi.zero_apply, Nat.cast_eq_zero, Nat.descFactorial_eq_zero_iff_lt, ← @Nat.cast_lt ℝ]
  exact (sub_lt_self (n : ℝ) zero_lt_one).trans'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Pochhammer/Variant71a79552991fc422421194863071e405ab526d686033eb9e08a77e9b3732a284.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Pochhammer/Variant71a79552991fc422421194863071e405ab526d686033eb9e08a77e9b3732a284.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6fa9fd5db3018c80895c816036c2102ae80ee37b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
