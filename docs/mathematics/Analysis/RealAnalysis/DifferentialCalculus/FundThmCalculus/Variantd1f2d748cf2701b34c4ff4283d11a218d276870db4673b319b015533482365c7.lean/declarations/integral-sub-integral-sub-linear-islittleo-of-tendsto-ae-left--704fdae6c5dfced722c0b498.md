## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:66a1eda6-f71e-1ac2-bb35-ad43ca80c7c1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 531–575.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

#### Strict differentiability

In this section we prove that for a measurable function `f` integrable on `a..b`,

* `integral_hasStrictFDerivAt_of_tendsto_ae`: the function `(u, v) ↦ ∫ x in u..v, f x` has
  derivative `(u, v) ↦ v • cb - u • ca` at `(a, b)` in the sense of strict differentiability
  provided that `f` tends to `ca` and `cb` almost surely as `x` tendsto to `a` and `b`,
  respectively;

* `integral_hasStrictFDerivAt`: the function `(u, v) ↦ ∫ x in u..v, f x` has
  derivative `(u, v) ↦ v • f b - u • f a` at `(a, b)` in the sense of strict differentiability
  provided that `f` is continuous at `a` and `b`;

* `integral_hasStrictDerivAt_of_tendsto_ae_right`: the function `u ↦ ∫ x in a..u, f x` has
  derivative `c` at `b` in the sense of strict differentiability provided that `f` tends to `c`
  almost surely as `x` tends to `b`;

* `integral_hasStrictDerivAt_right`: the function `u ↦ ∫ x in a..u, f x` has derivative `f b` at
  `b` in the sense of strict differentiability provided that `f` is continuous at `b`;

* `integral_hasStrictDerivAt_of_tendsto_ae_left`: the function `u ↦ ∫ x in u..b, f x` has
  derivative `-c` at `a` in the sense of strict differentiability provided that `f` tends to `c`
  almost surely as `x` tends to `a`;

* `integral_hasStrictDerivAt_left`: the function `u ↦ ∫ x in u..b, f x` has derivative `-f a` at
  `a` in the sense of strict differentiability provided that `f` is continuous at `a`.

/-- **Fundamental theorem of calculus-1**, strict differentiability in both endpoints.

If `f : ℝ → E` is integrable on `a..b` and `f x` has finite limits `ca` and `cb` almost surely as
`x` tends to `a` and `b`, respectively, then
`(u, v) ↦ ∫ x in u..v, f x` has derivative `(u, v) ↦ v • cb - u • ca` at `(a, b)`
in the sense of strict differentiability. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/FundThmCalculus/Variantd1f2d748cf2701b34c4ff4283d11a218d276870db4673b319b015533482365c7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
