## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c5786958-e05f-cd22-fcb7-50787866c430`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 238–253.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem between_mem_interval (I : IntervalRat) (c x ξ : ℝ)
    (hcI : c ∈ I) (hxI : x ∈ I) (hξ_between : min c x < ξ ∧ ξ < max c x) :
    ξ ∈ I := by
  simp only [IntervalRat.mem_def] at hcI hxI ⊢
  constructor
  · have h1 : (I.lo : ℝ) ≤ min c x := le_min hcI.1 hxI.1
    linarith [hξ_between.1]
  · have h2 : max c x ≤ (I.hi : ℝ) := max_le hcI.2 hxI.2
    linarith [hξ_between.2]

/-- Abstract Newton preservation lemma: if x is a root in I, and we compute
    N = I ∩ (c - fc/dI) where fc contains f(c) and dI contains f'(I),
    then x ∈ N.

    This captures the mathematical essence without dealing with the monadic
    structure of newtonStepTM/newtonStepSimple. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Newton/Variantc265901a711962d1f10ad0ce31d856568a033c21e1faffc24600c83db8272708.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Newton/Variantc265901a711962d1f10ad0ce31d856568a033c21e1faffc24600c83db8272708.lean#L238).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee950d0a98284d4d7ee1092dcbd1a1a07a9a244e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
