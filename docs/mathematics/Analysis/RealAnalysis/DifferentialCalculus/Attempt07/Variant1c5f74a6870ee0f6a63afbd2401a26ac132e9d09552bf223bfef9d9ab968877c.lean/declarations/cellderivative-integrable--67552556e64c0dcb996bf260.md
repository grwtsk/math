## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:19fae988-922c-0e88-964d-d3893f541f33`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 28–38.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cellDerivative_integrable {n : ℕ} (hn : 0 < n) (s : ℝ) :
    IntegrableOn (cellDerivative n s) (Ioc (n:ℝ) (n+1)) := by
  have hc : ContinuousOn (cellDerivative n s) (Icc (n:ℝ) (n+1)) := by
    apply continuousOn_of_forall_continuousAt
    intro x hx
    have hp : 0 < x := (show (0:ℝ)<n by exact_mod_cast hn).trans_le hx.1

      (Real.continuousAt_log hp.ne')).div

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Attempt07/Variant1c5f74a6870ee0f6a63afbd2401a26ac132e9d09552bf223bfef9d9ab968877c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Attempt07/Variant1c5f74a6870ee0f6a63afbd2401a26ac132e9d09552bf223bfef9d9ab968877c.lean#L28).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a66d3eba1308bd338147c127cce247b4ff778d6b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
