## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ee0d618f-0830-51f1-f1f2-0bc4f32b525b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 168–183.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actual_endpoint_model_eventuallyEq {A u : ℝ} (hA : 1≤A)
    (hu : u∈Ioo (0:ℝ) (2*A)) :
    criticalPrimeTest A =ᶠ[𝓝 u] fun v =>
      Real.exp (v/2)*endpointFullPolynomial A⁻¹ (2*A-v)/(A^9*sourceNormalization A) := by
  have hZ := (source_normalization_pos A hA).ne'
  have hne : A≠0 := by linarith
  filter_upwards [Ioo_mem_nhds hu.1 hu.2] with v hv
  have he := actual_endpoint_full_polynomial hA
    (y:=2*A-v) (show 2*A-v∈Icc (0:ℝ) (2*A) by constructor <;> linarith [hv.1,hv.2])
  have hvv : 2*A-(2*A-v)=v := by ring
  rw [hvv] at he
  unfold criticalPrimeTest
  rw [←he]
  field_simp [hne,hZ]

/-- Exact actual g' formula, with the physical endpoint orientation retained. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/EndpointDerivatives/Variant081ff995e4b4bafe72c39dcc1da4931569d1833723b39b7b006b1c2755fa74b8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/EndpointDerivatives/Variant081ff995e4b4bafe72c39dcc1da4931569d1833723b39b7b006b1c2755fa74b8.lean#L168).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9a0e14820bd15959c2ef6d64a6c1c9993e3f530a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
