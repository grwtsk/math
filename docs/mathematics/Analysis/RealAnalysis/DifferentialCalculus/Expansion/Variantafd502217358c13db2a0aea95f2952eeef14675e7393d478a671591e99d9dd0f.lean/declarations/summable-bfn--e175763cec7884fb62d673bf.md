## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b780dbdc-61e2-0c24-8ca8-9f16a5e97b69`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem summable_Bfn {s : ℂ} (hs : 1 < s.re) :
    LSeriesSummable (fun n => ((Λ n * Real.log n : ℝ) : ℂ)) s := by
  have h : LSeries.abscissaOfAbsConv (fun n => ((Λ n : ℝ) : ℂ)) < s.re :=
    lt_of_le_of_lt abscissa_vonMangoldt_le_one (by exact_mod_cast hs)
  have := LSeriesSummable_logMul_of_lt_re h
  rwa [logMul_vonMangoldt] at this

/-- L is differentiable on Re s > 0 away from 0 and 1 (here: Re s > 1). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Expansion/Variantafd502217358c13db2a0aea95f2952eeef14675e7393d478a671591e99d9dd0f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Expansion/Variantafd502217358c13db2a0aea95f2952eeef14675e7393d478a671591e99d9dd0f.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3e3b9bfcde9101b8f3c28b140c8bb809278cf521` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
