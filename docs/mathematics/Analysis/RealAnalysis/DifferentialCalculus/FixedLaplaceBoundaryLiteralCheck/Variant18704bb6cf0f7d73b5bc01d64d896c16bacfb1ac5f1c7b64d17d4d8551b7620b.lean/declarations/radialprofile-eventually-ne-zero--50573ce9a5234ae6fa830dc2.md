## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8a26f2cc-cd26-c859-43d1-14cfb792e466`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 327–333.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem radialProfile_eventually_ne_zero (z : ℂ) :
    ∀ᶠ r : ℝ in 𝓝 0, radialProfile z r ≠ 0 := by
  have h0 : radialProfile z 0 ≠ 0 := by
    simp [radialProfile, bumpMoment_zero_zero]
  exact (radialProfile_continuous z).continuousAt.eventually_ne h0

/-- The weighted radial mass is strictly positive because the actual bump mass is positive. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/FixedLaplaceBoundaryLiteralCheck/Variant18704bb6cf0f7d73b5bc01d64d896c16bacfb1ac5f1c7b64d17d4d8551b7620b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/FixedLaplaceBoundaryLiteralCheck/Variant18704bb6cf0f7d73b5bc01d64d896c16bacfb1ac5f1c7b64d17d4d8551b7620b.lean#L327).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b2320dba4608716c0425b4092fe6b348e0440a03` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
