## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c62f437f-5833-8ea0-a30a-e72a803ea3ab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 556–572.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_hasFDerivWithin_le'
    (hf : ∀ x ∈ s, HasFDerivWithinAt f (f' x) s x) (bound : ∀ x ∈ s, ‖f' x - φ‖ ≤ C)
    (hs : Convex ℝ s) (xs : x ∈ s) (ys : y ∈ s) : ‖f y - f x - φ (y - x)‖ ≤ C * ‖y - x‖ := by
  /- We subtract `φ` to define a new function `g` for which `g' = 0`, for which the previous theorem
    applies, `Convex.norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_hasFDerivWithin_le`. Then, we just need to glue
    together the pieces, expressing back `f` in terms of `g`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MeanValue/Variantf4b2168d18c57cec58aaf386fc37d8e85aa68645656482221ad4c34e789fcfb1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MeanValue/Variantf4b2168d18c57cec58aaf386fc37d8e85aa68645656482221ad4c34e789fcfb1.lean#L556).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `afc5067ec258509c693c3d33019e0dcc38796b88` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
