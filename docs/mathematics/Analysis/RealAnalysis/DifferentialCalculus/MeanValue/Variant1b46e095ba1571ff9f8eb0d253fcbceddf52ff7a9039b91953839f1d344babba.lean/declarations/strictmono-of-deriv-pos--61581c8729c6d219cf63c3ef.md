## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d43dfeee-60c7-d567-3efc-33282fff32a6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 396–403.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem strictMono_of_deriv_pos {f : ℝ → ℝ} (hf' : ∀ x, 0 < deriv f x) : StrictMono f :=
  strictMonoOn_univ.1 <| strictMonoOn_of_deriv_pos convex_univ (fun z _ =>
    (differentiableAt_of_deriv_ne_zero (hf' z).ne').differentiableWithinAt.continuousWithinAt)
    fun x _ => hf' x

/-- Let `f` be a function continuous on a convex (or, equivalently, connected) subset `D`
of the real line. If `f` is differentiable on the interior of `D` and `f'` is strictly positive,
then `f` is a strictly monotone function on `D`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MeanValue/Variant1b46e095ba1571ff9f8eb0d253fcbceddf52ff7a9039b91953839f1d344babba.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MeanValue/Variant1b46e095ba1571ff9f8eb0d253fcbceddf52ff7a9039b91953839f1d344babba.lean#L396).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f8bfa795e3f5929a13883060e46f6472f3de7d68` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
