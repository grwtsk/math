## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9eb35148-9414-57ba-3c6f-2c37b620b2b7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 779–805.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Vector-valued functions `f : E → F`. Strict differentiability.

A `C^1` function is strictly differentiable, when the field is `ℝ` or `ℂ`. This follows from the
mean value inequality on balls, which is a particular case of the above results after restricting
the scalars to `ℝ`. Note that it does not make sense to talk of a convex set over `ℂ`, but balls
make sense and are enough. Many formulations of the mean value inequality could be generalized to
balls over `ℝ` or `ℂ`. For now, we only include the ones that we need.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MeanValue/Variant7e1e6f097fe92a2493ea5b4bc9a1896c850514604f26f863f812906fb500b856.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MeanValue/Variant7e1e6f097fe92a2493ea5b4bc9a1896c850514604f26f863f812906fb500b856.lean#L779).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
