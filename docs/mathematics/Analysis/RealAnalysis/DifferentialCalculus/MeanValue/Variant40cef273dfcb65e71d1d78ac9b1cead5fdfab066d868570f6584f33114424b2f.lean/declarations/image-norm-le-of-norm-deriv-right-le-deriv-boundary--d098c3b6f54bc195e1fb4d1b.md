## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aa2c6e46-2df6-ac48-2905-7987770b1c09`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 277–295.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- General fencing theorem for continuous functions with an estimate on the norm of the derivative.
Let `f` and `B` be continuous functions on `[a, b]` such that

* `‖f a‖ ≤ B a`;
* `f` has right derivative `f'` at every point of `[a, b)`;
* `B` has derivative `B'` everywhere on `ℝ`;
* we have `‖f' x‖ ≤ B x` everywhere on `[a, b)`.

Then `‖f x‖ ≤ B x` everywhere on `[a, b]`. We use one-sided derivatives in the assumptions
to make this theorem work for piecewise differentiable functions.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MeanValue/Variant40cef273dfcb65e71d1d78ac9b1cead5fdfab066d868570f6584f33114424b2f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MeanValue/Variant40cef273dfcb65e71d1d78ac9b1cead5fdfab066d868570f6584f33114424b2f.lean#L277).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4b46ffd0e4aa5e81a5fcaf37a270b32772426225` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
