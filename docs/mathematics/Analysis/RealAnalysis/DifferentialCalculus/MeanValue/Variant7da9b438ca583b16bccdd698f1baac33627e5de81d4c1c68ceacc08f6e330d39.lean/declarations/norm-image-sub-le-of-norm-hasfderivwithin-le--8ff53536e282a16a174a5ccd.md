## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8a662d58-dcc6-16a4-48cd-dfcdb8941591`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 428–449.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (hf : ∀ x ∈ s, HasFDerivWithinAt f (f' x) s x) (bound : ∀ x ∈ s, ‖f' x‖ ≤ C) (hs : Convex ℝ s)
    (xs : x ∈ s) (ys : y ∈ s) : ‖f y - f x‖ ≤ C * ‖y - x‖ := by
  letI : RCLike 𝕜 := IsRCLikeNormedField.rclike 𝕜
  letI : NormedSpace ℝ G := RestrictScalars.normedSpace ℝ 𝕜 G
  /- By composition with `AffineMap.lineMap x y`, we reduce to a statement for functions defined
    on `[0,1]`, for which it is proved in `norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_deriv_le_segment`.
    We just have to check the differentiability of the composition and bounds on its derivative,
    which is straightforward but tedious for lack of automation. -/

/-- The mean value theorem on a convex set: if the derivative of a function is bounded by `C` on
`s`, then the function is `C`-Lipschitz on `s`. Version with `HasFDerivWithinAt` and
`LipschitzOnWith`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MeanValue/Variant7da9b438ca583b16bccdd698f1baac33627e5de81d4c1c68ceacc08f6e330d39.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MeanValue/Variant7da9b438ca583b16bccdd698f1baac33627e5de81d4c1c68ceacc08f6e330d39.lean#L428).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f92c4fb9d3518aa0b671799c23de8b13893d065` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
