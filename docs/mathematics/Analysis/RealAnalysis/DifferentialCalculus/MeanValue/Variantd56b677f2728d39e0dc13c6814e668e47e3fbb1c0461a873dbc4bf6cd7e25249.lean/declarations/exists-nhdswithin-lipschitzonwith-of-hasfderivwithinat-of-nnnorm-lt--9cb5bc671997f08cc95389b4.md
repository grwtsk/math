## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d3b80112-9672-f8ce-a3f5-a30f9dc7f934`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 466–484.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Let `s` be a convex set in a real normed vector space `E`, let `f : E → G` be a function
differentiable within `s` in a neighborhood of `x : E` with derivative `f'`. Suppose that `f'` is
continuous within `s` at `x`. Then for any number `K : ℝ≥0` larger than `‖f' x‖₊`, `f` is Lipschitz
on some neighborhood of `x` within `s`. See also
`Convex.exists_nhdsWithin_lipschitzOnWith_of_hasFDerivWithinAt_of_nnnorm_lt` for a version
with an explicit estimate on the Lipschitz constant. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MeanValue/Variantd56b677f2728d39e0dc13c6814e668e47e3fbb1c0461a873dbc4bf6cd7e25249.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MeanValue/Variantd56b677f2728d39e0dc13c6814e668e47e3fbb1c0461a873dbc4bf6cd7e25249.lean#L466).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f2ade99bd4274610b32419ae28b9b0ecd8fbce5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
