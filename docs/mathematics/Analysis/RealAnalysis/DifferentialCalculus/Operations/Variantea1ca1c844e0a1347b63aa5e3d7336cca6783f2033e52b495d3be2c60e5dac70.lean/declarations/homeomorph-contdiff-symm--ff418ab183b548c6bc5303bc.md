## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:527c72d7-e62e-5c91-85b9-627c0c6e69e7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 863–874.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Homeomorph.contDiff_symm [CompleteSpace E] (f : E ≃ₜ F) {f₀' : E → E ≃L[𝕜] F}
    (hf₀' : ∀ a, HasFDerivAt f (f₀' a : E →L[𝕜] F) a) (hf : ContDiff 𝕜 n (f : E → F)) :
    ContDiff 𝕜 n (f.symm : F → E) :=
  contDiff_iff_contDiffAt.2 fun x =>
    f.toPartialHomeomorph.contDiffAt_symm (mem_univ x) (hf₀' _) hf.contDiffAt

/-- Let `f` be a local homeomorphism of a nontrivially normed field, let `a` be a point in its
target. if `f` is `n` times continuously differentiable at `f.symm a`, and if the derivative at
`f.symm a` is nonzero, then `f.symm` is `n` times continuously differentiable at the point `a`.

This is one of the easy parts of the inverse function theorem: it assumes that we already have
an inverse function. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Operations/Variantea1ca1c844e0a1347b63aa5e3d7336cca6783f2033e52b495d3be2c60e5dac70.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Operations/Variantea1ca1c844e0a1347b63aa5e3d7336cca6783f2033e52b495d3be2c60e5dac70.lean#L863).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8aa1a77e69b2e25c7208d7cb52107e017c7bc3b6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
