## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a20bae44-cbb4-acc1-4407-75dd365716d1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 878–894.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Homeomorph.contDiff_symm_deriv [CompleteSpace 𝕜] (f : 𝕜 ≃ₜ 𝕜) {f' : 𝕜 → 𝕜}
    (h₀ : ∀ x, f' x ≠ 0) (hf' : ∀ x, HasDerivAt f (f' x) x) (hf : ContDiff 𝕜 n (f : 𝕜 → 𝕜)) :
    ContDiff 𝕜 n (f.symm : 𝕜 → 𝕜) :=
  contDiff_iff_contDiffAt.2 fun x =>
    f.toPartialHomeomorph.contDiffAt_symm_deriv (h₀ _) (mem_univ x) (hf' _) hf.contDiffAt

namespace PartialHomeomorph

variable (𝕜)

/-- Restrict a partial homeomorphism to the subsets of the source and target
that consist of points `x ∈ f.source`, `y = f x ∈ f.target`
such that `f` is `C^n` at `x` and `f.symm` is `C^n` at `y`.

Note that `n` is a natural number or `ω`, but not `∞`,
because the set of points of `C^∞`-smoothness of `f` is not guaranteed to be open. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Operations/Variant9e9a8e221acfa27972eced639be2a28edd34c04704595e5c8790ca79f9d9cb2c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Operations/Variant9e9a8e221acfa27972eced639be2a28edd34c04704595e5c8790ca79f9d9cb2c.lean#L878).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `47d12df4bfb825b5388750802f58aa3a4019d8aa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
