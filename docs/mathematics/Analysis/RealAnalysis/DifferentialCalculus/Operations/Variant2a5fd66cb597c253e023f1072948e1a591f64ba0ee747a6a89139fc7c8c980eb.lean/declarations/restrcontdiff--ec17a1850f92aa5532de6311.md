## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:37f2571ffb9ef58c66fa6c27fade41ed2fc79d836463f3a4bd93f293e4deaebf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 981–989.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def restrContDiff (f : OpenPartialHomeomorph E F) (n : ℕ∞ω) (hn : n ≠ ∞) :
    OpenPartialHomeomorph E F :=
  haveI H : f.IsImage {x | ContDiffAt 𝕜 n f x ∧ ContDiffAt 𝕜 n f.symm (f x)}
      {y | ContDiffAt 𝕜 n f.symm y ∧ ContDiffAt 𝕜 n f (f.symm y)} := fun x hx ↦ by
    simp [hx, and_comm]
  H.restr <| isOpen_iff_mem_nhds.2 fun _ ⟨hxs, hxf, hxf'⟩ ↦
    inter_mem (f.open_source.mem_nhds hxs) <| (hxf.eventually hn).and <|
    f.continuousAt hxs (hxf'.eventually hn)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Operations/Variant2a5fd66cb597c253e023f1072948e1a591f64ba0ee747a6a89139fc7c8c980eb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Operations/Variant2a5fd66cb597c253e023f1072948e1a591f64ba0ee747a6a89139fc7c8c980eb.lean#L981).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `80e898b98348cb111761430989137705f4a3cf63` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
