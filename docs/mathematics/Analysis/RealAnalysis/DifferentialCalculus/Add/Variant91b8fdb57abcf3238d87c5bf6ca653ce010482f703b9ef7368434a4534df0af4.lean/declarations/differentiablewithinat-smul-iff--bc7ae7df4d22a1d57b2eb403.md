## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b7da51ea-f250-eb4c-a330-a2cfce25cc22`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma differentiableWithinAt_smul_iff (c : R) [Invertible c] :
    DifferentiableWithinAt 𝕜 (c • f) s x ↔ DifferentiableWithinAt 𝕜 f s x := by
  refine ⟨fun h ↦ ?_, fun h ↦ h.const_smul c⟩
  apply (h.const_smul ⅟c).congr_of_eventuallyEq ?_ (by simp)
  filter_upwards with x using by simp

/-- A version of `fderivWithin_const_smul` without differentiability hypothesis:
in return, the constant `c` must be invertible, i.e. if `R` is a field. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Add/Variant91b8fdb57abcf3238d87c5bf6ca653ce010482f703b9ef7368434a4534df0af4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Add/Variant91b8fdb57abcf3238d87c5bf6ca653ce010482f703b9ef7368434a4534df0af4.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e8022ae616f5a0774fecc53e2a566c40fc195125` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
