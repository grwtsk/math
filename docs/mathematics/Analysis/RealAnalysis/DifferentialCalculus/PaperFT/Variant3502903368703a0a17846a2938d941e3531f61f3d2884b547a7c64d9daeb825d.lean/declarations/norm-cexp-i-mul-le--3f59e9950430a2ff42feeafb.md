## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:50ff2b0f-3924-07a2-4af3-31a1b357e6b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 80–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem norm_cexp_I_mul_le {z : ℂ} {u Λ : ℝ} (hu : |u| ≤ Λ) :
    ‖cexp (I * z * u)‖ ≤ Real.exp (|z.im| * Λ) := by
  rw [norm_cexp_I_mul, Real.exp_le_exp]
  calc -(z.im * u) ≤ |z.im * u| := neg_le_abs _
    _ = |z.im| * |u| := abs_mul _ _
    _ ≤ |z.im| * Λ := by gcongr

/-- [eq:hfbound], zeroth order: `supp f ⊆ [−Λ, Λ]` ⇒ `‖h_f(z)‖ ≤ e^{|Im z| Λ} ‖f‖₁`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/PaperFT/Variant3502903368703a0a17846a2938d941e3531f61f3d2884b547a7c64d9daeb825d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/PaperFT/Variant3502903368703a0a17846a2938d941e3531f61f3d2884b547a7c64d9daeb825d.lean#L80).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c00f24ccd9318d9cc528802e0db0021928048d61` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
