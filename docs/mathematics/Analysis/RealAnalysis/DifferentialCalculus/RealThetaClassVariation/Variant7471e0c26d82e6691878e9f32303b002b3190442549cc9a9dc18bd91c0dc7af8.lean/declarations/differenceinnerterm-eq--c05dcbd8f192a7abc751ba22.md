## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:05ca32a8-4c9b-9d5d-5994-08d5c1c41894`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 263–271.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem differenceInnerTerm_eq (A q x : ℝ) (l : ℕ)
    (hq : 0 < q) (hx : 0 < x) (hl : 1 ≤ l) :
    differenceInnerTerm A q l x = Real.log (l : ℝ) *
      rootWeight (correlationDifference A) (q * (l : ℝ)) x := by
  have hl0 : (0 : ℝ) < l := by exact_mod_cast (show 0 < l by omega)
  have hprod : (q * x) * (l : ℝ) = (q * (l : ℝ)) * x := by ring
  rw [differenceInnerTerm, hprod, Real.log_mul (mul_pos hq hl0).ne' hx.ne', rootWeight]
  ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/RealThetaClassVariation/Variant7471e0c26d82e6691878e9f32303b002b3190442549cc9a9dc18bd91c0dc7af8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/RealThetaClassVariation/Variant7471e0c26d82e6691878e9f32303b002b3190442549cc9a9dc18bd91c0dc7af8.lean#L263).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d5b62edbe24d154eb42a48080fbdd2f6f5e3e6dc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
