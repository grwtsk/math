## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:15edd198-7f65-c80d-70a3-5b2f066ffe4e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1011–1015.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
nonrec lemma ContDiffAt.contDiffOn (h : ContDiffAt 𝕜 n f x) (hm : m ≤ n) (h' : m = ∞ → n = ω):
    ∃ u ∈ 𝓝 x, ContDiffOn 𝕜 m f u := by
  simpa [nhdsWithin_univ] using h.contDiffOn hm h'

/-- A function is `C^(n + 1)` at a point iff locally, it has a derivative which is `C^n`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Defs/Variantb412b5dd84a8c9888788c6b3a85a7f668bdb349eca70d4064d2398c7bb7f44b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Defs/Variantb412b5dd84a8c9888788c6b3a85a7f668bdb349eca70d4064d2398c7bb7f44b6.lean#L1011).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e834e7aeb42bb0ef05723187db05ca420093bb70` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
