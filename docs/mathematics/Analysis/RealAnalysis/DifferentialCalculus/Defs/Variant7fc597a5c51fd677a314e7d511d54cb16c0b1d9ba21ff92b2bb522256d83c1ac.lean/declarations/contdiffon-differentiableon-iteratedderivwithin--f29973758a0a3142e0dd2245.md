## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aef96026-58e9-8c8e-f8d8-df6efceca0ae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 161–167.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContDiffOn.differentiableOn_iteratedDerivWithin {n : WithTop ℕ∞} {m : ℕ}
    (h : ContDiffOn 𝕜 n f s) (hmn : m < n) (hs : UniqueDiffOn 𝕜 s) :
    DifferentiableOn 𝕜 (iteratedDerivWithin m f s) s := fun x hx =>
  (h x hx).differentiableWithinAt_iteratedDerivWithin hmn <| by rwa [insert_eq_of_mem hx]

/-- The property of being `C^n`, initially defined in terms of the Fréchet derivative, can be
reformulated in terms of the one-dimensional derivative on sets with unique derivatives. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Defs/Variant7fc597a5c51fd677a314e7d511d54cb16c0b1d9ba21ff92b2bb522256d83c1ac.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Defs/Variant7fc597a5c51fd677a314e7d511d54cb16c0b1d9ba21ff92b2bb522256d83c1ac.lean#L161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1ff08774614c00c44490691c85df17723f649e61` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
