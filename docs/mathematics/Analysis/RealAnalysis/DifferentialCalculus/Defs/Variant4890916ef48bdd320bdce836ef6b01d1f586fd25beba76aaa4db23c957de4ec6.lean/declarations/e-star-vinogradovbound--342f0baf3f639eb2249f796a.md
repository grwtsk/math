## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:25b900ab46ef95b6d321969d738ab354c0152f5a007dd0b0194b2f463b58fb2d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 195–208.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Eπ_star.vinogradovBound (A B C x₀ : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ x ≥ x₀, Eπ_star x ≤
    A * (log x) ^ B * exp (-C * (log x) ^ (3 / 5) / (log (log x)) ^ (1 / 5))

@[blueprint
  "admissible-bound-monotone"
  (title := "Admissible bound decreasing for large x")
  (statement := /--
  If $A,B,C,R > 0$ then the classical bound is monotone
  decreasing for $x \geq \exp( R (2B/C)^2 )$. -/)
  (proof := /-- Differentiate the bound and check the
  sign. -/)
  (latexEnv := "lemma")
  (discussion := 900)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Defs/Variant4890916ef48bdd320bdce836ef6b01d1f586fd25beba76aaa4db23c957de4ec6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Defs/Variant4890916ef48bdd320bdce836ef6b01d1f586fd25beba76aaa4db23c957de4ec6.lean#L195).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5addac012b292e2f595824a9e15f98d6ce1ed7ed` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
