## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0229f25b-1dfc-d7e1-a4db-dba12ef69a4b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem interactionOperator_readout (f g : H) :
    quadraticReadout interactionOperator (pairState f g) = (⟪f, g⟫_ℂ).re := by
  rw [quadraticReadout, interactionOperator_pairState]
  simp only [WithLp.prod_inner_apply, pairState, inner_smul_right,
    Complex.add_re, Complex.mul_re, Complex.div_re, Complex.one_re, Complex.one_im]
  have hc : (⟪g, f⟫_ℂ).re = (⟪f, g⟫_ℂ).re := by
    rw [← inner_conj_symm f g]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/CompensatedReadout/Variant056d05e1be4359b3120659ff634fca81dab1db180ffb19adbe97d6e7d3fa75ec.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/CompensatedReadout/Variant056d05e1be4359b3120659ff634fca81dab1db180ffb19adbe97d6e7d3fa75ec.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `695045ae8ebe63c9041be9a02a6912f701f01e56` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
