## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f151b90e-43f0-6f01-380a-acfbc3e30c3f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 53–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem deriv_deriv_phiC (hϱ : TaperProfile ϱ) (hw : 0 < w) (hwL : 2 * w ≤ L) :
    deriv (deriv (fun u => (phi ϱ L w u : ℂ)))
      = fun u => ((deriv (deriv (phi ϱ L w)) u : ℝ) : ℂ) := by
  have h3 := phi_contDiff hϱ hw hwL
  have hd1 : Differentiable ℝ (phi ϱ L w) := h3.differentiable (by norm_num)
  have hd2 : Differentiable ℝ (deriv (phi ϱ L w)) :=
    (h3.deriv' (n := 2)).differentiable (by norm_num)
  rw [deriv_ofReal_comp hd1, deriv_ofReal_comp hd2]

/-- [eq:hfbound] for φ: `‖φ̂(z)‖ · ‖z‖² ≤ e^{|Im z|·L/2} · C₁` for all complex `z`,
`C₁ = ‖φ''‖₁`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Strip/Variant4bd8386780c27b4810fcf305a6eba2a5c94c260a533c96b01fb3e429cdb4a524.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Strip/Variant4bd8386780c27b4810fcf305a6eba2a5c94c260a533c96b01fb3e429cdb4a524.lean#L53).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac44c49c44d5089268b23a66c0bd640550a8efe2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
