## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8f1c7633-0edc-4c4f-e886-2c74b9ddccd9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 755–768.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma rightDeriv_lt_slope (hfc : StrictConvexOn ℝ S f) (hx : x ∈ S) (hy : y ∈ S) (hxy : x < y)
    (hfd : DifferentiableWithinAt ℝ f (Ioi x) x) :
    derivWithin f (Ioi x) x < slope f x y :=
  hfc.lt_slope_of_hasDerivWithinAt_Ioi hx hy hxy hfd.hasDerivWithinAt

@[deprecated (since := "2025-01-26")]
alias right_deriv_lt_slope := rightDeriv_lt_slope

/-- If `f : ℝ → ℝ` is strictly convex on `S` and differentiable within `S` at `x ∈ S`, then the
slope of any secant line with left endpoint at `x` is strictly greater than the derivative of `f`
within `S` at `x`.

This is fractionally weaker than `StrictConvexOn.lt_slope_of_hasDerivWithinAt_Ioi` but simpler to
apply under a `DifferentiableOn S` hypothesis. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Deriv/Variantfe079a638c5f9d74670c9e71bf7d207c76fbc49b4c77e4a06e8626b4a5071cdd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Deriv/Variantfe079a638c5f9d74670c9e71bf7d207c76fbc49b4c77e4a06e8626b4a5071cdd.lean#L755).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e362013b12c648b244b3d41443f5c1995cc87421` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
