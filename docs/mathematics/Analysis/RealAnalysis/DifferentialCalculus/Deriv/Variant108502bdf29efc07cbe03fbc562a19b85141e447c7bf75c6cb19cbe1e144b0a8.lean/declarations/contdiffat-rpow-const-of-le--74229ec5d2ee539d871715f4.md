## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:50a831cd-fcfa-1ee4-6b6e-bee0b6b42423`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 603–607.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContDiffAt.rpow_const_of_le (hf : ContDiffAt ℝ m f x) (h : ↑m ≤ p) :
    ContDiffAt ℝ m (fun x => f x ^ p) x := by
  rw [← contDiffWithinAt_univ] at *; exact hf.rpow_const_of_le h

@[fun_prop]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Deriv/Variant108502bdf29efc07cbe03fbc562a19b85141e447c7bf75c6cb19cbe1e144b0a8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Deriv/Variant108502bdf29efc07cbe03fbc562a19b85141e447c7bf75c6cb19cbe1e144b0a8.lean#L603).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5f7b8accf926316ac82cf1ee8ceae30863d99e2d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
