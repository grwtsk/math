## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fb33f7e3-565b-d7b5-e1ff-a3ea8ad4c14e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 298–305.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem convexOn_of_deriv2_nonneg' {D : Set ℝ} (hD : Convex ℝ D) {f : ℝ → ℝ}
    (hf' : DifferentiableOn ℝ f D) (hf'' : DifferentiableOn ℝ (deriv f) D)
    (hf''_nonneg : ∀ x ∈ D, 0 ≤ (deriv^[2] f) x) : ConvexOn ℝ D f :=
  convexOn_of_deriv2_nonneg hD hf'.continuousOn (hf'.mono interior_subset)
    (hf''.mono interior_subset) fun x hx => hf''_nonneg x (interior_subset hx)

/-- If a function `f` is twice differentiable on an open convex set `D ⊆ ℝ` and
`f''` is nonpositive on `D`, then `f` is concave on `D`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Deriv/Variant5fa5cc07cc13597d4ffbded8429d50e9d6d657628eb9423ee32af80a38319db4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Deriv/Variant5fa5cc07cc13597d4ffbded8429d50e9d6d657628eb9423ee32af80a38319db4.lean#L298).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4952735024e2918df5fcb68c9ed090ca420aa435` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
