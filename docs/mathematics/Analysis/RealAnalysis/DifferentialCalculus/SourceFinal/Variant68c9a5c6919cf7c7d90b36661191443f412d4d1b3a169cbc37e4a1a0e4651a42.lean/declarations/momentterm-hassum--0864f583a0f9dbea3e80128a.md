## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b7dabe00-4da2-0c34-8be4-468575116813`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 238–253.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem momentTerm_hasSum (x : ℝ) {t : ℝ} (ht : 0 < t) :
    HasSum (fun n : ℕ ↦ momentTerm x n t) (curvatureKernel x t) := by
  have h := (ContinuousResearch.CompensatedGammaIntegral.exponential_kernel_hasSum ht).mul_left
    (t * Real.exp (-x * t))
  have he : t * Real.exp (-x * t) * (1 / (Real.exp (2 * t) - 1)) = curvatureKernel x t := by
    unfold curvatureKernel

  rw [he] at h
  apply h.congr_fun
  intro n
  unfold momentTerm
  rw [mul_assoc, ← Real.exp_add]

  ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceFinal/Variant68c9a5c6919cf7c7d90b36661191443f412d4d1b3a169cbc37e4a1a0e4651a42.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceFinal/Variant68c9a5c6919cf7c7d90b36661191443f412d4d1b3a169cbc37e4a1a0e4651a42.lean#L238).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27bb206ef9c9fe0867f26cac058b52d30f83a38b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
