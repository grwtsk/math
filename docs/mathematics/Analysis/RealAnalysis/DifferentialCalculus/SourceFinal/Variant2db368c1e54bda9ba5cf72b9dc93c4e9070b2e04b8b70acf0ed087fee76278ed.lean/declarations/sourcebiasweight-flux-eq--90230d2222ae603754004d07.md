## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3a263f45-4e24-437e-1ab3-627e9b26ffe1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 208–221.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sourceBiasWeight_flux_eq {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) {x : ℝ} (hx : 0 < x) :
    x^2 * deriv (sourceBiasWeight A) x = biasPrimitive A (Real.log x) := by
  rw [(sourceBiasWeight_hasDerivAt hA hx).deriv]
  have he : Real.exp (-Real.log x/2)*x = Real.exp (Real.log x/2) := by
    calc
      _ = Real.exp (-Real.log x/2)*Real.exp (Real.log x) := by rw [Real.exp_log hx]
      _ = _ := by rw [← Real.exp_add]; congr 1; ring
  unfold biasPrimitive
  calc
    _ = (Real.exp (-Real.log x/2)*x) *
      (deriv (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A) (Real.log x) -
        sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A (Real.log x)/2) := by field_simp
    _ = _ := by rw [he]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceFinal/Variant2db368c1e54bda9ba5cf72b9dc93c4e9070b2e04b8b70acf0ed087fee76278ed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceFinal/Variant2db368c1e54bda9ba5cf72b9dc93c4e9070b2e04b8b70acf0ed087fee76278ed.lean#L208).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f71b13e2ca85b0c2d763b34715664eb73d14c81d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
