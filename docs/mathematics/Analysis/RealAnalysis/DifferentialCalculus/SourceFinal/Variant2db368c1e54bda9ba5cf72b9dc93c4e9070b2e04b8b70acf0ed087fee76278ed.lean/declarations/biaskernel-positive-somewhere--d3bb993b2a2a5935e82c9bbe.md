## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:73c9cc26-bf84-2c41-681d-c4d9e6f50189`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 186–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem biasKernel_positive_somewhere {A : ℝ} (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    ∃ x ∈ Icc 1 (Real.exp (2*A)), 0 < biasKernel A x := by
  obtain ⟨t, ht, hpos⟩ := biasLogKernel_positive_somewhere hA
  refine ⟨Real.exp t, ⟨Real.one_le_exp_iff.mpr ht.1, Real.exp_le_exp.mpr ht.2⟩, ?_⟩
  have he := biasKernel_eq_log_transport (A := A) (Real.exp_pos t)
  rw [Real.log_exp] at he
  rw [← he] at hpos
  exact (mul_pos_iff_of_pos_right (Real.exp_pos t)).mp hpos

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceFinal/Variant2db368c1e54bda9ba5cf72b9dc93c4e9070b2e04b8b70acf0ed087fee76278ed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceFinal/Variant2db368c1e54bda9ba5cf72b9dc93c4e9070b2e04b8b70acf0ed087fee76278ed.lean#L186).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f71b13e2ca85b0c2d763b34715664eb73d14c81d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
