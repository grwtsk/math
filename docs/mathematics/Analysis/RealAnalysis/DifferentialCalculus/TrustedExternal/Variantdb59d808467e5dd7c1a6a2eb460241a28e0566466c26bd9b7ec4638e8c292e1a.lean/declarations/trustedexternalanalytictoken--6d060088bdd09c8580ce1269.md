## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:000a83c81afd1ddf701de681e2ac5a076a1d540430cb6b785c44b09bb946c968`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 43–53.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure TrustedExternalAnalyticToken
    (Γ : BoundaryCalculus.AnalyticContext)
    (b : AnalyticBoundaryKind)
    (q : BoundaryCalculus.AnalyticClaim Γ b) where
  payload : Authority.ExternalPayload
  trusted : Authority.TrustedExternalCertificate payload
  boundaryMatches : payload.kind = b
  statementMatches : payload.statement = q.statement

/-- A trusted external analytic token proves its analytic claim, via the
verifier soundness theorem carried by `trusted`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/TrustedExternal/Variantdb59d808467e5dd7c1a6a2eb460241a28e0566466c26bd9b7ec4638e8c292e1a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/TrustedExternal/Variantdb59d808467e5dd7c1a6a2eb460241a28e0566466c26bd9b7ec4638e8c292e1a.lean#L43).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4e5fcc311c01bb61f4efcc74d22b0a1f23076764` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
