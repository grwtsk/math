## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:622c8298-defe-044f-582d-d1077af63d8b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 29–83.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma deriv_Gamma_nat (n : ℕ) :
    deriv Gamma (n + 1) = n ! * (-γ + harmonic n) := by
  /- This follows from two properties of the function `f n = log (Gamma n)`:
  firstly, the elementary computation that `deriv f (n + 1) = deriv f n + 1 / n`, so that
  `deriv f n = deriv f 1 + harmonic n`; secondly, the convexity of `f` (the Bohr-Mollerup theorem),
  which shows that `deriv f n` is `log n + o(1)` as `n → ∞`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/GammaDeriv/Variante0eda3d6a6785f5ffdc1c514fdaf90c2855b6deaf0fd2d5f2da6924da429859d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/GammaDeriv/Variante0eda3d6a6785f5ffdc1c514fdaf90c2855b6deaf0fd2d5f2da6924da429859d.lean#L29).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `526f6d5cc6ebc3d0938391c4565674c1e798db20` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
