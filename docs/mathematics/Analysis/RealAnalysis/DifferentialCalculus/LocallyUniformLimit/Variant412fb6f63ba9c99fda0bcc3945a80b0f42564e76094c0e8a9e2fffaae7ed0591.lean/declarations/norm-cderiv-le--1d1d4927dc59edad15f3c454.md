## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5b4e1f00-ad81-0f32-1a95-6bea8c96a57f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem norm_cderiv_le (hr : 0 < r) (hf : ∀ w ∈ sphere z r, ‖f w‖ ≤ M) :
    ‖cderiv r f z‖ ≤ M / r := by
  have hM : 0 ≤ M := by
    obtain ⟨w, hw⟩ : (sphere z r).Nonempty := NormedSpace.sphere_nonempty.mpr hr.le
    exact (norm_nonneg _).trans (hf w hw)
  have h1 : ∀ w ∈ sphere z r, ‖((w - z) ^ 2)⁻¹ • f w‖ ≤ M / r ^ 2 := by
    intro w hw
    simp only [mem_sphere_iff_norm] at hw hf
    simp only [norm_smul, inv_mul_eq_div, hw, norm_inv, norm_pow]
    exact div_le_div₀ hM (hf w hw) (sq_pos_of_pos hr) le_rfl
  have h2 := circleIntegral.norm_integral_le_of_norm_le_const hr.le h1
  simp only [cderiv, norm_smul]
  refine (mul_le_mul le_rfl h2 (norm_nonneg _) (norm_nonneg _)).trans (le_of_eq ?_)
  simp [field]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/LocallyUniformLimit/Variant412fb6f63ba9c99fda0bcc3945a80b0f42564e76094c0e8a9e2fffaae7ed0591.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/LocallyUniformLimit/Variant412fb6f63ba9c99fda0bcc3945a80b0f42564e76094c0e8a9e2fffaae7ed0591.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d691113fbecf81a638eac73916f0c2a3e089be78` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
