## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dea0fbde-1661-4476-cd79-bcc6ec43119f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–130.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (hF : ∀ᶠ n in φ, DifferentiableOn ℂ (F n) U) {δ : ℝ} (hδ : 0 < δ) (hK : IsCompact K)

    TendstoUniformlyOn (deriv ∘ F) (cderiv δ f) φ K := by

    filter_upwards [hF] with n h using h.continuousOn.mono hKU
  have h2 : IsCompact (cthickening δ K) := hK.cthickening
  have h3 : TendstoUniformlyOn F f φ (cthickening δ K) :=
    (tendstoLocallyUniformlyOn_iff_forall_isCompact hU).mp hf (cthickening δ K) hKU h2

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/LocallyUniformLimit/Variantf755ac3f7ae549595169fa40c1fd134a5e21a18f7db7b0f3cc7a865e5a5b9d2f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/LocallyUniformLimit/Variantf755ac3f7ae549595169fa40c1fd134a5e21a18f7db7b0f3cc7a865e5a5b9d2f.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b6e8df704946911ddef9dac231d43c06de47fb83` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
