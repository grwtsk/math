## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:91a608e6-1f2c-92cd-1aea-39ee4c21a9b4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 392–402.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma rhoTwo_taper : TaperProfile rhoTwo where
  contDiff := by
    rw [rhoTwo_eq_fun]
    exact contDiff_const.mul (Theta_contDiff.of_le (WithTop.coe_le_coe.mpr le_top))
  monotone := by
    rw [rhoTwo_eq_fun]
    refine (monotone_of_deriv_nonneg Theta_differentiable fun x => ?_).const_mul (inv_nonneg.mpr Theta_one_pos.le)
    rw [Theta_deriv]; exact theta_nonneg x
  eq_zero x hx := by rw [rhoTwo_eq, Theta_of_nonpos hx, mul_zero]
  eq_one x hx := by rw [rhoTwo_eq, Theta_of_one_le hx, inv_mul_cancel₀ Theta_one_pos.ne']

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Gevrey/Variant2c72d72910eae1b731aec5d7f6c253ed4afb7881de7ea98444596e178e17a15a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Gevrey/Variant2c72d72910eae1b731aec5d7f6c253ed4afb7881de7ea98444596e178e17a15a.lean#L392).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b42c6d3993eb756afcffbde22bacb5f0e057649a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
