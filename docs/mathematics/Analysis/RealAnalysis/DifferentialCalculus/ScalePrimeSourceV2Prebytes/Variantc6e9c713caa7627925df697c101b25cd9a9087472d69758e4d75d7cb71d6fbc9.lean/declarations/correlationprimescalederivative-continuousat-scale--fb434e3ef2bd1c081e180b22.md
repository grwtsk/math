## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:669b8fc5-cd3f-ae19-9a4e-88ee1d027c44`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 348–359.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem correlationPrimeScaleDerivative_continuousAt_scale {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) (s : ℝ) :
    ContinuousAt (fun B => correlationPrimeScaleDerivative B s) A := by
  let L : ComplexL2 →L[ℝ] ComplexL2 :=
    (translation s).toLinearIsometry.toContinuousLinearMap.restrictScalars ℝ
  have hr := spatialDerivativeState_continuousAt hA
  have hp := scaleDerivativeState_continuousAt hA
  exact (Complex.continuous_re.continuousAt.comp
    (hr.inner (L.continuous.continuousAt.comp hp))).sub
    (Complex.continuous_re.continuousAt.comp
      (hp.inner (L.continuous.continuousAt.comp hr)))

/-- Actual C_A′ is C1 in all positive scales, without any C4 bump or q_A′ scale derivative. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ScalePrimeSourceV2Prebytes/Variantc6e9c713caa7627925df697c101b25cd9a9087472d69758e4d75d7cb71d6fbc9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ScalePrimeSourceV2Prebytes/Variantc6e9c713caa7627925df697c101b25cd9a9087472d69758e4d75d7cb71d6fbc9.lean#L348).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8bbb6e00f3276e4a4138124df74cdb64d8691058` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
