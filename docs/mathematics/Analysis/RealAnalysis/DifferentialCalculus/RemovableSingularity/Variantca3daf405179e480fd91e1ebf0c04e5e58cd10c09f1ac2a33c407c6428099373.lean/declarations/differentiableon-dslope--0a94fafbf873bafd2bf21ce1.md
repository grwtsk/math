## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3ba8d742-6ee3-68c6-cf60-453a106ba3c7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 70–80.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem differentiableOn_dslope {f : ℂ → E} {s : Set ℂ} {c : ℂ} (hc : s ∈ 𝓝 c) :
    DifferentiableOn ℂ (dslope f c) s ↔ DifferentiableOn ℂ f s :=
  ⟨fun h => h.of_dslope, fun h =>
    (differentiableOn_compl_singleton_and_continuousAt_iff hc).mp <|
      ⟨Iff.mpr (differentiableOn_dslope_of_nmem fun h => h.2 rfl) (h.mono <| diff_subset _ _),
        continuousAt_dslope_same.2 <| h.differentiableAt hc⟩⟩
#align complex.differentiable_on_dslope Complex.differentiableOn_dslope

/-- **Removable singularity** theorem: if `s` is a neighborhood of `c : ℂ`, a function `f : ℂ → E`
is complex differentiable on `s \ {c}`, and $f(z) - f(c)=o((z-c)^{-1})$, then `f` redefined to be
equal to `limUnder (𝓝[≠] c) f` at `c` is complex differentiable on `s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/RemovableSingularity/Variantca3daf405179e480fd91e1ebf0c04e5e58cd10c09f1ac2a33c407c6428099373.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/RemovableSingularity/Variantca3daf405179e480fd91e1ebf0c04e5e58cd10c09f1ac2a33c407c6428099373.lean#L70).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `04a35c71b68298502fd065199782b146800f958e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
