## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:81b302ff-0703-a197-95e9-a5b06c455f14`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 95–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem differentiableOn_update_limUnder_insert_of_isLittleO {f : ℂ → E} {s : Set ℂ} {c : ℂ}
    (hc : s ∈ 𝓝[≠] c) (hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f s)
    (ho : (fun z => f z - f c) =o[𝓝[≠] c] fun z => (z - c)⁻¹) :
    DifferentiableOn ℂ (update f c (limUnder (𝓝[≠] c) f)) (insert c s) :=
  differentiableOn_update_limUnder_of_isLittleO (insert_mem_nhds_iff.2 hc)
    (hd.mono fun _ hz => hz.1.resolve_left hz.2) ho

/-- **Removable singularity** theorem: if `s` is a neighborhood of `c : ℂ`, a function `f : ℂ → E`
is complex differentiable and is bounded on `s \ {c}`, then `f` redefined to be equal to
`limUnder (𝓝[≠] c) f` at `c` is complex differentiable on `s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/RemovableSingularity/Variant3a8473dcef042923db953ec42e284f2f1f32dc0facffba68434f1bb401b1a5d2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/RemovableSingularity/Variant3a8473dcef042923db953ec42e284f2f1f32dc0facffba68434f1bb401b1a5d2.lean#L95).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `513775a05a8fb616fbd6b8220de2c17ed8ea2b29` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
