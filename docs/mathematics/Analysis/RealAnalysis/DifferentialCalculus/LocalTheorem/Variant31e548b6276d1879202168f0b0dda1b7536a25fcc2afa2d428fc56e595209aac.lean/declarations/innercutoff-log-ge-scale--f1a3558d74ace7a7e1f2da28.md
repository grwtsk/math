## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aecd439f-b3ca-7afa-4f88-0d664d175485`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 129–138.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem innerCutoff_log_ge_scale {A d : ℝ}
    (hA : 1 ≤ A) (hd : 1 ≤ d) (hdA : d ≤ Real.exp A) :
    A ≤ Real.log (innerCutoff A d) := by
  have ha : 0 < A := by linarith
  have hd0 : 0 < d := by linarith
  have hl : Real.log d ≤ A := by
    simpa only [Real.log_exp] using Real.log_le_log hd0 hdA
  rw [innerCutoff, Real.log_div (Real.exp_ne_zero _) hd0.ne', Real.log_exp]
  linarith

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/LocalTheorem/Variant31e548b6276d1879202168f0b0dda1b7536a25fcc2afa2d428fc56e595209aac.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/LocalTheorem/Variant31e548b6276d1879202168f0b0dda1b7536a25fcc2afa2d428fc56e595209aac.lean#L129).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `83fb5658ecaa6e06fe06faea22f28c892c34aa19` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
