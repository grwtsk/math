## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a08f109a-6b87-0ca2-a209-44457b93ffbf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–96.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private lemma continuousOn_Iic {f : ℝ → ℝ} {b : ℝ} (h : ContinuousAt f b)
    (hd₀ : DifferentiableOn ℝ f (Iio b)) : ContinuousOn f (Iic b) := by
  simp_rw [← Iio_union_right]
  apply hd₀.continuousOn.union_continuousAt isOpen_Iio (by simp [h])

/-- If `f` is continuous at `a` and differentiable on `Ioi a`, then `f` is continuous on
`Ici a`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/DerivativeTest/Variant11e6358403dd18572432637dfe1722321c23837f0a2705cf9685c35e05b2a089.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/DerivativeTest/Variant11e6358403dd18572432637dfe1722321c23837f0a2705cf9685c35e05b2a089.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `72104ad17098b03b48952f53e52cd894e9999582` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
