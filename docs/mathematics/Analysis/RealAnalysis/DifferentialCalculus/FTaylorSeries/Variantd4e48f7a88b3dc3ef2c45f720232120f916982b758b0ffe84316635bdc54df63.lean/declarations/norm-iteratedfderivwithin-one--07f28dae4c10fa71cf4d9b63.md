## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c781d5db-7416-096a-53f8-7d20d35ffe6f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 470–475.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem norm_iteratedFDerivWithin_one (f : E → F) (h : UniqueDiffWithinAt 𝕜 s x) :
    ‖iteratedFDerivWithin 𝕜 1 f s x‖ = ‖fderivWithin 𝕜 f s x‖ := by
  simp only [← norm_fderivWithin_iteratedFDerivWithin,
    iteratedFDerivWithin_zero_eq_comp, LinearIsometryEquiv.comp_fderivWithin _ h]
  apply (continuousMultilinearCurryFin0 𝕜 E F).symm.toLinearIsometry.norm_toContinuousLinearMap_comp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/FTaylorSeries/Variantd4e48f7a88b3dc3ef2c45f720232120f916982b758b0ffe84316635bdc54df63.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/FTaylorSeries/Variantd4e48f7a88b3dc3ef2c45f720232120f916982b758b0ffe84316635bdc54df63.lean#L470).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `945cbc93169a584f61c295a4b15bac091ce62a6a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
