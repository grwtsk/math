## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b8947641-26f2-5ee5-7f2b-fce6d6e28207`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–235.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn_top_iff' (hN : ∞ ≤ N) :
    HasFTaylorSeriesUpToOn N f p s ↔
      (∀ x ∈ s, (p x 0).curry0 = f x) ∧
        ∀ m : ℕ, ∀ x ∈ s, HasFDerivWithinAt (fun y => p y m) (p x m.succ).curryLeft s x := by
  -- Everything except for the continuity is trivial:
  refine ⟨fun h => ⟨h.1, fun m => h.2 m (natCast_lt_of_coe_top_le_withTop hN _)⟩, fun h =>
    ⟨h.1, fun m _ => h.2 m, fun m _ x hx =>
      -- The continuity follows from the existence of a derivative:
      (h.2 m x hx).continuousWithinAt⟩⟩

/-- If a function has a Taylor series at order at least `1`, then the term of order `1` of this
series is a derivative of `f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/FTaylorSeries/Variantd4e48f7a88b3dc3ef2c45f720232120f916982b758b0ffe84316635bdc54df63.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/FTaylorSeries/Variantd4e48f7a88b3dc3ef2c45f720232120f916982b758b0ffe84316635bdc54df63.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `945cbc93169a584f61c295a4b15bac091ce62a6a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
