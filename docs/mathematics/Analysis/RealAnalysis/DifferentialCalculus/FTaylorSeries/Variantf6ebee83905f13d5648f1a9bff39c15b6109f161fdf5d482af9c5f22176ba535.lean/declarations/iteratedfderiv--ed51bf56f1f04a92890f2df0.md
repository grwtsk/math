## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:95323f692a53a8fa0c6563ab3955fcbaa2836cae48d48fff59235e61663cceab`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 804–808.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def iteratedFDeriv (n : ℕ) (f : E → F) : E → E [×n]→L[𝕜] F :=
  Nat.recOn n (fun x => ContinuousMultilinearMap.uncurry0 𝕜 E (f x)) fun _ rec x =>
    ContinuousLinearMap.uncurryLeft (fderiv 𝕜 rec x)

/-- Formal Taylor series associated to a function. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/FTaylorSeries/Variantf6ebee83905f13d5648f1a9bff39c15b6109f161fdf5d482af9c5f22176ba535.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/FTaylorSeries/Variantf6ebee83905f13d5648f1a9bff39c15b6109f161fdf5d482af9c5f22176ba535.lean#L804).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ad3dee4ba3e3f6a9fd4030b170538f3f7d6f7099` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
