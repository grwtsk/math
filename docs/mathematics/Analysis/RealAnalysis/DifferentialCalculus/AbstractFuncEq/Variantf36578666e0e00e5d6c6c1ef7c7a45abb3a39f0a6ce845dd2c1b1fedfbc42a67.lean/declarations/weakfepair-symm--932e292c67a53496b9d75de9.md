## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:84115f7de1eb19fc0a8fb4c7a6aa9ba637389f3d22fb5857a83b05ab91367fef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 112–127.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def WeakFEPair.symm (P : WeakFEPair E) : WeakFEPair E where
  f := P.g
  g := P.f
  k := P.k
  ε := P.ε⁻¹
  f₀ := P.g₀
  g₀ := P.f₀
  hf_int := P.hg_int
  hg_int := P.hf_int
  hf_top := P.hg_top
  hg_top := P.hf_top
  hε     := inv_ne_zero P.hε
  hk     := P.hk
  h_feq  := P.h_feq'

/-- The hypotheses are symmetric in `f` and `g`, with the constant `ε` replaced by `ε⁻¹`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/AbstractFuncEq/Variantf36578666e0e00e5d6c6c1ef7c7a45abb3a39f0a6ce845dd2c1b1fedfbc42a67.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/AbstractFuncEq/Variantf36578666e0e00e5d6c6c1ef7c7a45abb3a39f0a6ce845dd2c1b1fedfbc42a67.lean#L112).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ae226f9708f6749b7e8280ce7b8d4379bed5493f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
