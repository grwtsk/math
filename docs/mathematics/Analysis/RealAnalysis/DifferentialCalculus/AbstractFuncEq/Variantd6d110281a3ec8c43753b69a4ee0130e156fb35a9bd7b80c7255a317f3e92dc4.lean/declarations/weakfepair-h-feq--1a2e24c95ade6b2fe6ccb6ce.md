## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6ea2aed9-f25a-2a5b-6807-503472ce94c1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 109–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma WeakFEPair.h_feq' (P : WeakFEPair E) (x : ℝ) (hx : 0 < x) :
    P.g (1 / x) = (P.ε⁻¹ * ↑(x ^ P.k)) • P.f x := by
  rw [(div_div_cancel₀ (one_ne_zero' ℝ) ▸ P.h_feq (1 / x) (one_div_pos.mpr hx) :), ← mul_smul]

  rw [one_div, inv_rpow hx.le, ofReal_inv]
  field [P.hε, (rpow_pos_of_pos hx _).ne']

/-- The hypotheses are symmetric in `f` and `g`, with the constant `ε` replaced by `ε⁻¹`. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/AbstractFuncEq/Variantd6d110281a3ec8c43753b69a4ee0130e156fb35a9bd7b80c7255a317f3e92dc4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/AbstractFuncEq/Variantd6d110281a3ec8c43753b69a4ee0130e156fb35a9bd7b80c7255a317f3e92dc4.lean#L109).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `786eaf38768954576399ea35b001bff35aa7138e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
