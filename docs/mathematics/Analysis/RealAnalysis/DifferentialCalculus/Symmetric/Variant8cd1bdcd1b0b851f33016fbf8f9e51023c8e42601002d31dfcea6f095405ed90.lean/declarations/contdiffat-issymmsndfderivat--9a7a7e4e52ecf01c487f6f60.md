## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a6656a9d-afe5-7a95-1d4a-8f687d3007d7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 518–543.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem ContDiffAt.isSymmSndFDerivAt {n : WithTop ℕ∞}
    (hf : ContDiffAt 𝕜 n f x) (hn : minSmoothness 𝕜 2 ≤ n) : IsSymmSndFDerivAt 𝕜 f x := by
  by_cases h : IsRCLikeNormedField 𝕜
  -- First deal with the `ℝ` or `ℂ` case, where `C^2` is enough.
  · intro v w
    apply second_derivative_symmetric_of_eventually (f := f) (f' := fderiv 𝕜 f) (x := x)
    · obtain ⟨u, hu, h'u⟩ : ∃ u ∈ 𝓝 x, ContDiffOn 𝕜 2 f u :=

  -- then deal with the case of an arbitrary field, with analytic functions.
  · simp only [minSmoothness, h, ↓reduceIte, top_le_iff] at hn
    apply ContDiffAt.isSymmSndFDerivAt_of_omega
    simpa [hn] using hf

/-- If a function is `C^2` within a set at a point, and accumulated by points in the interior
of the set, then its second derivative there is symmetric. Over a field
different from `ℝ` or `ℂ`, we should require that the function is analytic. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Symmetric/Variant8cd1bdcd1b0b851f33016fbf8f9e51023c8e42601002d31dfcea6f095405ed90.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Symmetric/Variant8cd1bdcd1b0b851f33016fbf8f9e51023c8e42601002d31dfcea6f095405ed90.lean#L518).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4ab4652a30b92ccfd172a3911a1eb77cee60984` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
