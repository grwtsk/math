## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:722103e5-e96a-31e8-7ea2-384339c4142c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 515–525.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma exist_minSmoothness_le_ne_infty {n : WithTop ℕ∞} {m : ℕ} (hm : minSmoothness 𝕜 m ≤ n) :
    ∃ n', minSmoothness 𝕜 m ≤ n' ∧ n' ≤ n ∧ n' ≠ ∞ := by
  simp only [minSmoothness] at hm ⊢
  split_ifs with h
  · simp only [h, ↓reduceIte] at hm
    exact ⟨m, le_rfl, hm, by simp⟩
  · simp only [h, ↓reduceIte, top_le_iff] at hm
    refine ⟨ω, le_rfl, by simp [hm], by simp⟩

/-- If a function is `C^2` at a point, then its second derivative there is symmetric. Over a field
different from `ℝ` or `ℂ`, we should require that the function is analytic. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Symmetric/Variant3adedad5b7cdf8a2e1861e326da848661980af58b4fd128a3f954c04921295e5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Symmetric/Variant3adedad5b7cdf8a2e1861e326da848661980af58b4fd128a3f954c04921295e5.lean#L515).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0ffa96c5444b290667206d339dda1cfa7a22d25d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
