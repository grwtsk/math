## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:56945f79-a5ab-14cc-fa22-4986817169ea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 524–530.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma generateFrom_le_iff {g : Set ((n : ℕ) × (𝔼ⁿ → X))} {d : DiffeologicalSpace X} :
    generateFrom g ≤ d ↔ ∀ n (p : 𝔼ⁿ → X), ⟨n, p⟩ ∈ g → (@IsPlot _ d) p :=
  generateFrom_le_iff_subset_toPlots.trans ⟨fun h _ _ hp ↦ h hp, fun h _ hp ↦ h _ _ hp⟩

/-- The diffeology defined by `g`. Same as `generateFrom g`, except that its set of plots is
definitionally equal to `g`. -/
@[instance_reducible]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Varianta1f9f34a5dfc8a84b2fa9a669db8fa8716a5d7eb684f6d4354bd450ffeab57fe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Varianta1f9f34a5dfc8a84b2fa9a669db8fa8716a5d7eb684f6d4354bd450ffeab57fe.lean#L524).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ba74d8bddcc80b3393f1db17bd4bb92781dfb32e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
