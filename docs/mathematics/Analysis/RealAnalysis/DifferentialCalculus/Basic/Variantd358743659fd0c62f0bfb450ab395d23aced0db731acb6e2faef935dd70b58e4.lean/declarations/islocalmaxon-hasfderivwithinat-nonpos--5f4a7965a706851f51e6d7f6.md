## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9f1c6f48-f825-6021-4cba-d03f1536da6d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 127–140.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsLocalMaxOn.hasFDerivWithinAt_nonpos (h : IsLocalMaxOn f s a)
    (hf : HasFDerivWithinAt f f' s a) (hy : y ∈ posTangentConeAt s a) : f' y ≤ 0 := by

  have hc' : Tendsto (‖c ·‖) atTop atTop := tendsto_abs_atTop_atTop.comp hc

  filter_upwards [hd.eventually h, hc.eventually_ge_atTop 0] with n hfn hcn
  exact mul_nonpos_of_nonneg_of_nonpos hcn (sub_nonpos.2 hfn)

/-- If `f` has a local max on `s` at `a` and `y` belongs to the positive tangent cone
of `s` at `a`, then `f' y ≤ 0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variantd358743659fd0c62f0bfb450ab395d23aced0db731acb6e2faef935dd70b58e4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variantd358743659fd0c62f0bfb450ab395d23aced0db731acb6e2faef935dd70b58e4.lean#L127).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `faab416bde2c48e592a7bb0234ebf6309147840e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
