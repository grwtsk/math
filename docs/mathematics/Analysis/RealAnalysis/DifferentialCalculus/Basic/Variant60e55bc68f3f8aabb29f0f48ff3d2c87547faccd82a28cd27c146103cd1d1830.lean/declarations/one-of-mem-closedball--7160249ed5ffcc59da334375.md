## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fee0ae87-86b4-729f-0cd8-ce4691cd362c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–145.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem one_of_mem_closedBall (hx : x ∈ closedBall c f.rIn) : f x = 1 := by
  apply ContDiffBumpBase.eq_one _ _ f.one_lt_rOut_div_rIn
  simpa only [norm_smul, Real.norm_eq_abs, abs_inv, abs_of_nonneg f.rIn_pos.le, ← div_eq_inv_mul,
    div_le_one f.rIn_pos] using mem_closedBall_iff_norm.1 hx

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant60e55bc68f3f8aabb29f0f48ff3d2c87547faccd82a28cd27c146103cd1d1830.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant60e55bc68f3f8aabb29f0f48ff3d2c87547faccd82a28cd27c146103cd1d1830.lean#L141).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
