## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:10943237-9cc5-d401-82d7-6bba8feaca9a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 930–935.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem differentiableOn_congr (h' : ∀ x ∈ s, f₁ x = f x) :
    DifferentiableOn 𝕜 f₁ s ↔ DifferentiableOn 𝕜 f s :=
  ⟨fun h => DifferentiableOn.congr h fun y hy => (h' y hy).symm, fun h =>
    DifferentiableOn.congr h h'⟩
#align differentiable_on_congr differentiableOn_congr

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant409b20e7d4c42baa1a4949d7de87759823cf5204b87c4e35bb5aea9c99bafdfa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant409b20e7d4c42baa1a4949d7de87759823cf5204b87c4e35bb5aea9c99bafdfa.lean#L930).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f2d8d9c24d5c267d02323df0ec84e4adcca2c07a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
