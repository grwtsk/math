## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e8792cd41bac4d7395acd7c170d7540dc3b21f00674cd32d1501f189a864fc3a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 77–83.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def HasLineDerivWithinAt (f : E → F) (f' : F) (s : Set E) (x : E) (v : E) :=
  HasDerivWithinAt (fun t ↦ f (x + t • v)) f' ((fun t ↦ x + t • v) ⁻¹' s) (0 : 𝕜)

/-- `f` has the derivative `f'` at the point `x` along the direction `v`.
That is, `f (x + t v) = f x + t • f' + o (t)` when `t` tends to `0`.
Note that this definition is less well behaved than the total Fréchet derivative, which
should generally be favored over this one. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant7a14d1f3d3b632be000db96ca7254ed2e1505faabd9c79f5637cbb0d2e531cf1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant7a14d1f3d3b632be000db96ca7254ed2e1505faabd9c79f5637cbb0d2e531cf1.lean#L77).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `92ee1378520150e7f2b632c41a9821af096f9945` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
