## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2e3816d5-b86e-083b-eb88-39aec8dfb51d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 302–309.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasLineDerivWithinAt_congr_set (h : s =ᶠ[𝓝 x] t) :
    HasLineDerivWithinAt 𝕜 f f' s x v ↔ HasLineDerivWithinAt 𝕜 f f' t x v := by
  apply hasDerivWithinAt_congr_set
  let F := fun (t : 𝕜) ↦ x + t • v
  have B : ContinuousAt F 0 := by apply Continuous.continuousAt; fun_prop
  have : s =ᶠ[𝓝 (F 0)] t := by convert h; simp [F]
  exact B.preimage_mem_nhds this

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant7a14d1f3d3b632be000db96ca7254ed2e1505faabd9c79f5637cbb0d2e531cf1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant7a14d1f3d3b632be000db96ca7254ed2e1505faabd9c79f5637cbb0d2e531cf1.lean#L302).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `92ee1378520150e7f2b632c41a9821af096f9945` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
