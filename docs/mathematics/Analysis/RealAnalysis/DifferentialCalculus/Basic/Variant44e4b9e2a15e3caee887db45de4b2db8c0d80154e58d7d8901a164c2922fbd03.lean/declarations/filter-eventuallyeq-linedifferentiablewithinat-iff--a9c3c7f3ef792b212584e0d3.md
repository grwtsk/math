## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ca3ce0a7-d703-e1cc-dc54-9c2c3937f916`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 391–396.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Filter.EventuallyEq.lineDifferentiableWithinAt_iff
    (h : f₀ =ᶠ[𝓝[s] x] f₁) (hx : f₀ x = f₁ x) :
    LineDifferentiableWithinAt 𝕜 f₀ s x v ↔ LineDifferentiableWithinAt 𝕜 f₁ s x v :=
  ⟨fun h' ↦ ((h.hasLineDerivWithinAt_iff hx).1 h'.hasLineDerivWithinAt).lineDifferentiableWithinAt,
  fun h' ↦ ((h.hasLineDerivWithinAt_iff hx).2 h'.hasLineDerivWithinAt).lineDifferentiableWithinAt⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant44e4b9e2a15e3caee887db45de4b2db8c0d80154e58d7d8901a164c2922fbd03.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant44e4b9e2a15e3caee887db45de4b2db8c0d80154e58d7d8901a164c2922fbd03.lean#L391).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `845c3c205f16025c33acfe87249671b74ee6b849` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
