## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b11f4a78-620a-be49-e936-504d84e22289`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 237–242.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContDiff.continuousLinearMap_comp {f : E → F} (g : F →L[𝕜] G) (hf : ContDiff 𝕜 n f) :
    ContDiff 𝕜 n fun x => g (f x) :=
  contDiffOn_univ.1 <| ContDiffOn.continuousLinearMap_comp _ (contDiffOn_univ.2 hf)

/-- The iterated derivative within a set of the composition with a linear map on the left is
obtained by applying the linear map to the iterated derivative. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant9cce7fc6cd06b7ce6f11c764b68e9cd9a9507deae676c34f0efb926aba661748.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant9cce7fc6cd06b7ce6f11c764b68e9cd9a9507deae676c34f0efb926aba661748.lean#L237).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cbed95fb0f6362777de54bccea7a4854f2292029` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
