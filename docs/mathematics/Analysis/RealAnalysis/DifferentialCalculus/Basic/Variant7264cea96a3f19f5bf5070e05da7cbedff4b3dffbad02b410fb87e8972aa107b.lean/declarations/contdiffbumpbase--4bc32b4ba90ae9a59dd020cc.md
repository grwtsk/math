## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b2a98dc43811187b02269d8caba08fd6258a22a1a95e06cda6f60148d1f1e790`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ContDiffBumpBase (E : Type*) [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E] where
  toFun : ℝ → E → ℝ
  mem_Icc : ∀ (R : ℝ) (x : E), toFun R x ∈ Icc (0 : ℝ) 1
  symmetric : ∀ (R : ℝ) (x : E), toFun R (-x) = toFun R x
  smooth : ContDiffOn ℝ ⊤ (uncurry toFun) (Ioi (1 : ℝ) ×ˢ (univ : Set E))
  eq_one : ∀ R : ℝ, 1 < R → ∀ x : E, ‖x‖ ≤ 1 → toFun R x = 1
  support : ∀ R : ℝ, 1 < R → Function.support (toFun R) = Metric.ball (0 : E) R
#align cont_diff_bump_base ContDiffBumpBase

/-- A class registering that a real vector space admits bump functions. This will be instantiated
first for inner product spaces, and then for finite-dimensional normed spaces.
We use a specific class instead of `Nonempty (ContDiffBumpBase E)` for performance reasons. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant7264cea96a3f19f5bf5070e05da7cbedff4b3dffbad02b410fb87e8972aa107b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant7264cea96a3f19f5bf5070e05da7cbedff4b3dffbad02b410fb87e8972aa107b.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `93a38d2ae13d0b73ae802faab0a4f17eaf4d788b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
