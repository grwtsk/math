## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a8677edd-f674-ed05-1207-d29c205cc0d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 167–173.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem HasFDerivWithinAt.unique_on (hf : HasFDerivWithinAt f f' s x)
    (hg : HasFDerivWithinAt f f₁' s x) : EqOn f' f₁' (tangentConeAt 𝕜 s x) := by
  intro y hy
  rcases exists_fun_of_mem_tangentConeAt hy with ⟨ι, l, hl, c, d, hd₀, hds, hcd⟩
  exact tendsto_nhds_unique (hf.lim hd₀ hds hcd) (hg.lim hd₀ hds hcd)

/-- `UniqueDiffWithinAt` achieves its goal: it implies the uniqueness of the derivative. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant5f69a2ab90d9b18aee218efb258c4ec307a264e5de9c1812b98a6a01b8dc6bce.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant5f69a2ab90d9b18aee218efb258c4ec307a264e5de9c1812b98a6a01b8dc6bce.lean#L167).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f5f3c70718a7365e2599ea92e3cbc099e9a38a0a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
