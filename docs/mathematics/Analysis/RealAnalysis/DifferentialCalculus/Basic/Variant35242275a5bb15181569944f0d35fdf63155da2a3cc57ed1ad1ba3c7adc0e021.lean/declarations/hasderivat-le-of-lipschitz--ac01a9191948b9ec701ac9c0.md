## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fd22306f-72cb-e3c2-ee29-7a4c179c6453`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 830–836.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem HasDerivAt.le_of_lipschitz {f : 𝕜 → F} {f' : F} {x₀ : 𝕜} (hf : HasDerivAt f f' x₀)
    {C : ℝ≥0} (hlip : LipschitzWith C f) : ‖f'‖ ≤ C := by
  simpa using HasFDerivAt.le_of_lipschitz hf.hasFDerivAt hlip

/-- Converse to the mean value inequality: if `f` is `C`-lipschitz
on a neighborhood of `x₀` then its derivative at `x₀` has norm bounded by `C`. This version
only assumes that `‖f x - f x₀‖ ≤ C * ‖x - x₀‖` in a neighborhood of `x`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant35242275a5bb15181569944f0d35fdf63155da2a3cc57ed1ad1ba3c7adc0e021.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant35242275a5bb15181569944f0d35fdf63155da2a3cc57ed1ad1ba3c7adc0e021.lean#L830).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c744a4d730cb38fa3e7c1c8fa2cd7ac8bfb0c673` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
