## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8f36d36e-318f-0b1b-b001-d137baeefb05`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 232–246.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem fderiv_zero_of_not_differentiableAt (h : ¬DifferentiableAt 𝕜 f x) : fderiv 𝕜 f x = 0 := by
  have : ¬∃ f', HasFDerivAt f f' x := h
  simp [fderiv, this]
#align fderiv_zero_of_not_differentiable_at fderiv_zero_of_not_differentiableAt

section DerivativeUniqueness

/- In this section, we discuss the uniqueness of the derivative.
We prove that the definitions `UniqueDiffWithinAt` and `UniqueDiffOn` indeed imply the
uniqueness of the derivative. -/
/-- If a function f has a derivative f' at x, a rescaled version of f around x converges to f',
i.e., `n (f (x + (1/n) v) - f x)` converges to `f' v`. More generally, if `c n` tends to infinity
and `c n * d n` tends to `v`, then `c n * (f (x + d n) - f x)` tends to `f' v`. This lemma expresses
this fact, for functions having a derivative within a set. Its specific formulation is useful for
tangent cone related discussions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant5ea41cc29cf7cd589d9e249a368eeb5ceb02be09710d505a5a59bb540d7bf8bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Basic/Variant5ea41cc29cf7cd589d9e249a368eeb5ceb02be09710d505a5a59bb540d7bf8bd.lean#L232).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d82a69d68f8d557c107f7784f8dc4fb35378222` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
