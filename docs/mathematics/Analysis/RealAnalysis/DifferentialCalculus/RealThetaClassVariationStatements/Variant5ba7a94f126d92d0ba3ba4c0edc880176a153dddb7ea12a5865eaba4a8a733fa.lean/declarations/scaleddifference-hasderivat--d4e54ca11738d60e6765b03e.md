## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bd450dba-0d0a-76bb-8e42-176c3968005f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 624–630.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem scaledDifference_hasDerivAt (A q x : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) (hq : 0 < q) (hx : 0 < x) :
    HasDerivAt (fun t : ℝ ↦ differenceSamplingKernel A (q * t))
      (q * deriv (differenceSamplingKernel A) (q * x)) x := by
  have h := (differenceSamplingKernel_hasDerivAt A (q * x) hA (mul_pos hq hx)).differentiableAt
  apply (h.hasDerivAt.comp x ((hasDerivAt_id x).const_mul q)).congr_deriv
  simp only [mul_one, mul_comm]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/RealThetaClassVariationStatements/Variant5ba7a94f126d92d0ba3ba4c0edc880176a153dddb7ea12a5865eaba4a8a733fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/RealThetaClassVariationStatements/Variant5ba7a94f126d92d0ba3ba4c0edc880176a153dddb7ea12a5865eaba4a8a733fa.lean#L624).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dc0c528a79568af1f92d78fe186300e2eafce3f8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
