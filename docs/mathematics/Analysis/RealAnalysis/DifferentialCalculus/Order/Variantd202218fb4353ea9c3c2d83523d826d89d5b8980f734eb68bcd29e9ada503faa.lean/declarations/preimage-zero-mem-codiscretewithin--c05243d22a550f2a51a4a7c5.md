## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ff13da27-42e5-c338-bcce-d81e7b413307`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 695–707.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem preimage_zero_mem_codiscreteWithin {x : 𝕜} (h₁f : AnalyticOnNhd 𝕜 f U) (h₂f : f x ≠ 0)
    (hx : x ∈ U) (hU : IsConnected U) :
    f ⁻¹' {0}ᶜ ∈ codiscreteWithin U := by
  rcases h₁f.eqOn_zero_or_eventually_ne_zero_of_preconnected hU.isPreconnected with hzero | hne
  · exact (h₂f (hzero hx)).elim
  · exact hne

/--
If an analytic function `f` is not constantly zero on `𝕜`, then its set of zeros is codiscrete.

See `AnalyticOnNhd.preimage_mem_codiscreteWithin` for a more general statement in preimages of
codiscrete sets.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Order/Variantd202218fb4353ea9c3c2d83523d826d89d5b8980f734eb68bcd29e9ada503faa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Order/Variantd202218fb4353ea9c3c2d83523d826d89d5b8980f734eb68bcd29e9ada503faa.lean#L695).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `91c0435f282bf65f8d121392325982d509863ccf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
