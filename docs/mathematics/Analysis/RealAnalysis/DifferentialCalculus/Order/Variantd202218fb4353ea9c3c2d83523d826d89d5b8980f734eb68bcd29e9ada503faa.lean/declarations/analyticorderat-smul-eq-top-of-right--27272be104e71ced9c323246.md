## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:64fd3746-e768-3df1-affe-43fb011ae82f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–249.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma analyticOrderAt_smul_eq_top_of_right {f : 𝕜 → 𝕜} (hg : analyticOrderAt g z₀ = ⊤) :
    analyticOrderAt (f • g) z₀ = ⊤ := by
  rw [analyticOrderAt_eq_top, eventually_nhds_iff] at *
  obtain ⟨t, h₁t, h₂t, h₃t⟩ := hg
  exact ⟨t, fun y hy ↦ by simp [h₁t y hy], h₂t, h₃t⟩

/-- The order is additive when scalar multiplying analytic functions. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Order/Variantd202218fb4353ea9c3c2d83523d826d89d5b8980f734eb68bcd29e9ada503faa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Order/Variantd202218fb4353ea9c3c2d83523d826d89d5b8980f734eb68bcd29e9ada503faa.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `91c0435f282bf65f8d121392325982d509863ccf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
