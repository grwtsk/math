## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1ff0f6da-1c67-92f6-9d34-db9456cbe634`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 265–272.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem green_source_correlation_integral (A : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    (∫ t, poleSquaredGreenKernel t * sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A t) =
      baseCorrelation A 0 / sourceNormalization A := by
  simp_rw [source_correlation_eq_pole_operator_sq A _ hA, ← mul_div_assoc]
  rw [integral_div, pole_squared_green_full_weak_identity (baseCorrelation A)
    (base_correlation_cont_diff_four A) (base_correlation_has_compact_support A (by linarith))]

/-- The source normalization restores the actual base observation at zero. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/PoleGreenWeakIdentity/Variant8d061fb214ff0c2d0e54266deecacadb5bf11175ccde5c99d9485b7836a123f9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/PoleGreenWeakIdentity/Variant8d061fb214ff0c2d0e54266deecacadb5bf11175ccde5c99d9485b7836a123f9.lean#L265).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8df11993623d61d84400371425eb4501fd8ee032` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
