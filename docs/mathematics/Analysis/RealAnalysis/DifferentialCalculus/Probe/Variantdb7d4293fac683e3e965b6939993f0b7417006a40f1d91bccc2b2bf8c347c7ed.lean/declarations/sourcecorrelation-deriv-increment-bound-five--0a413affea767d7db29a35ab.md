## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a143085e-f372-ffc7-3611-40695d84a1de`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–67.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sourceCorrelation_deriv_increment_bound_five {A : ℝ} (hA : 200 ≤ A) (a y : ℝ) :
    |deriv (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A) (a + y) -
      deriv (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A) a| ≤ 5 / A ^ 2 * |y| := by
  have hp : 0 < A := by linarith
  have h := Convex.norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_deriv_le
    (s := Set.univ) (f := deriv (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A))
    (fun x _ ↦ (sourceCorrelation_deriv_contDiff hp).differentiable (by norm_num) x)
    (fun x _ ↦ by simpa only [Real.norm_eq_abs] using
      sourceCorrelation_second_deriv_abs_le_five hA x)
    convex_univ (mem_univ a) (mem_univ (a + y))
  simpa only [Real.norm_eq_abs, add_sub_cancel_left] using h

/-- The even source correlation has vanishing first derivative at the retained origin. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Probe/Variantdb7d4293fac683e3e965b6939993f0b7417006a40f1d91bccc2b2bf8c347c7ed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Probe/Variantdb7d4293fac683e3e965b6939993f0b7417006a40f1d91bccc2b2bf8c347c7ed.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `509edd1a4fba561f9176e161a2f7c999f9d43943` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
