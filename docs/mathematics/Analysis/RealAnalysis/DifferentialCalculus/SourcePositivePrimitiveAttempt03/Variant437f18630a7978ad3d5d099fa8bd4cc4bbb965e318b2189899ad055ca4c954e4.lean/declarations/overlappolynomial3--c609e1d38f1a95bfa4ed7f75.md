## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:34b5bbd7964b328489daf492c4a3fc55172c4e83643b73d35233e2f5c56cbead`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 61–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def overlapPolynomial3 (u : ℝ) : ℝ := (196608/5005:ℝ)*u + (-32768/231:ℝ)*u^3 + (4096/15:ℝ)*u^5 + (-1024/5:ℝ)*u^6 + (256/7:ℝ)*u^8 + (-192/35:ℝ)*u^10 + (16/33:ℝ)*u^12 + (-8/429:ℝ)*u^14

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourcePositivePrimitiveAttempt03/Variant437f18630a7978ad3d5d099fa8bd4cc4bbb965e318b2189899ad055ca4c954e4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourcePositivePrimitiveAttempt03/Variant437f18630a7978ad3d5d099fa8bd4cc4bbb965e318b2189899ad055ca4c954e4.lean#L61).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ea4a9122f5060198eba18536d49dc778a14ea609` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
