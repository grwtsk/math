## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:72323a69-8168-f46a-2b92-86543d631c9c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–106.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem fderivWithin_inv (x_ne_zero : x ≠ 0) (hxs : UniqueDiffWithinAt 𝕜 s x) :
    fderivWithin 𝕜 (fun x => x⁻¹) s x = smulRight (1 : 𝕜 →L[𝕜] 𝕜) (-(x ^ 2)⁻¹) := by
  rw [DifferentiableAt.fderivWithin (differentiableAt_inv x_ne_zero) hxs]
  exact fderiv_inv

variable {c : 𝕜 → 𝕜} {c' : 𝕜}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Inv/Variante678cd6cfe099ed878a1dae7a5d743b997c9b9f9a9d30449f18b002faab3802f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Inv/Variante678cd6cfe099ed878a1dae7a5d743b997c9b9f9a9d30449f18b002faab3802f.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `46b9cb6439f3de8c6424f7e0c80a09c3def4324d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
