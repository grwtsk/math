## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9b830370-1cf2-78e3-8f2f-1c563849faf6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 117–123.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem derivWithin_inv' (hc : DifferentiableWithinAt 𝕜 c s x) (hx : c x ≠ 0) :
    derivWithin (fun x => (c x)⁻¹) s x = -derivWithin c s x / c x ^ 2 := by
  by_cases hsx : UniqueDiffWithinAt 𝕜 s x
  · exact (hc.hasDerivWithinAt.inv hx).derivWithin hsx
  · simp [derivWithin_zero_of_not_uniqueDiffWithinAt hsx]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Inv/Variante678cd6cfe099ed878a1dae7a5d743b997c9b9f9a9d30449f18b002faab3802f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Inv/Variante678cd6cfe099ed878a1dae7a5d743b997c9b9f9a9d30449f18b002faab3802f.lean#L117).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
