## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a77b5802-6f1e-3bc2-2fd6-7b3693b2fcfa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 269–276.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem LipschitzOnWith.ae_differentiableWithinAt_real {C : ℝ≥0} {f : ℝ → V} {s : Set ℝ}
    (h : LipschitzOnWith C f s) (hs : MeasurableSet s) :
    ∀ᵐ x ∂volume.restrict s, DifferentiableWithinAt ℝ f s x :=
  h.locallyBoundedVariationOn.ae_differentiableWithinAt hs

/-- A real Lipschitz function into a finite-dimensional real vector space is differentiable
almost everywhere. For the general Rademacher theorem assuming
that the source space is finite dimensional, see `LipschitzWith.ae_differentiableAt`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/BoundedVariation/Variant5cdcaf9235ca1b5ed6f17db98b86f48d6094ed1b309f110b0be3b8376c968830.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/BoundedVariation/Variant5cdcaf9235ca1b5ed6f17db98b86f48d6094ed1b309f110b0be3b8376c968830.lean#L269).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5167835d1e349a14554ea4593a9951e47c04b705` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
