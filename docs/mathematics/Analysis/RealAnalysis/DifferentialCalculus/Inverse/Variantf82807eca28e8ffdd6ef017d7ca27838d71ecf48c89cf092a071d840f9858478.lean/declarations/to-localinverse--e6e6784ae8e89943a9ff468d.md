## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4f4b641f-47b7-022c-7afe-7d3258841440`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 669–679.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem to_localInverse (hf : HasStrictFDerivAt f (f' : E →L[𝕜] F) a) :
    HasStrictFDerivAt (hf.localInverse f f' a) (f'.symm : F →L[𝕜] E) (f a) :=
  (hf.toLocalHomeomorph f).hasStrictFDerivAt_symm hf.image_mem_toLocalHomeomorph_target <| by
    simpa [← localInverse_def] using hf
#align has_strict_fderiv_at.to_local_inverse HasStrictFDerivAt.to_localInverse

/-- If `f : E → F` has an invertible derivative `f'` at `a` in the sense of strict differentiability
and `g (f x) = x` in a neighborhood of `a`, then `g` has derivative `f'.symm` at `f a`.

For a version assuming `f (g y) = y` and continuity of `g` at `f a` but not `[CompleteSpace E]`
see `of_local_left_inverse`.  -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Inverse/Variantf82807eca28e8ffdd6ef017d7ca27838d71ecf48c89cf092a071d840f9858478.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Inverse/Variantf82807eca28e8ffdd6ef017d7ca27838d71ecf48c89cf092a071d840f9858478.lean#L669).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ab5a49dafead72d33ab58af04cee1e6e313909a7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
