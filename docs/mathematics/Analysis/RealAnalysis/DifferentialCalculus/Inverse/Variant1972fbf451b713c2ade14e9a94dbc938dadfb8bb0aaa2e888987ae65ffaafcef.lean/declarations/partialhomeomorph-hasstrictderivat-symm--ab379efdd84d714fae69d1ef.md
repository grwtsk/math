## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cdcb5a50-7ed5-e89b-c77d-9079a1edf9cb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 71–80.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem PartialHomeomorph.hasStrictDerivAt_symm (f : PartialHomeomorph 𝕜 𝕜) {a f' : 𝕜}
    (ha : a ∈ f.target) (hf' : f' ≠ 0) (htff' : HasStrictDerivAt f f' (f.symm a)) :
    HasStrictDerivAt f.symm f'⁻¹ a :=
  htff'.of_local_left_inverse (f.symm.continuousAt ha) hf' (f.eventually_right_inverse ha)

/-- If `f (g y) = y` for `y` in some neighborhood of `a`, `g` is continuous at `a`, and `f` has an
invertible derivative `f'` at `g a`, then `g` has the derivative `f'⁻¹` at `a`.

This is one of the easy parts of the inverse function theorem: it assumes that we already have
an inverse function. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Inverse/Variant1972fbf451b713c2ade14e9a94dbc938dadfb8bb0aaa2e888987ae65ffaafcef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Inverse/Variant1972fbf451b713c2ade14e9a94dbc938dadfb8bb0aaa2e888987ae65ffaafcef.lean#L71).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac3a640138c24139222f899903e1bdecb5725f71` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
