## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4a681d3e05f3f18d31390a2a9608bfd37ed168b4c57098c0736995773141126d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 84–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def thetaPhiRawD3 (t : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  (3270 * Real.pi ^ 2) * thetaGaussianSum 4 9 t -
  (375 * Real.pi) * thetaGaussianSum 2 5 t -
  (4232 * Real.pi ^ 3) * thetaGaussianSum 6 13 t +
  (1440 * Real.pi ^ 4) * thetaGaussianSum 8 17 t -
  (128 * Real.pi ^ 5) * thetaGaussianSum 10 21 t

/-- The fourth source derivative as a finite combination of Gaussian sums. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ThetaPositiveLift/Variantc9a9ca3638173b1baf6a42b1b5d1719b8b69888e120f39b0fc6c0ebd858898bc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ThetaPositiveLift/Variantc9a9ca3638173b1baf6a42b1b5d1719b8b69888e120f39b0fc6c0ebd858898bc.lean#L84).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a37aacc165cd26eff3b8ab34ab3a023b216e1e7a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
