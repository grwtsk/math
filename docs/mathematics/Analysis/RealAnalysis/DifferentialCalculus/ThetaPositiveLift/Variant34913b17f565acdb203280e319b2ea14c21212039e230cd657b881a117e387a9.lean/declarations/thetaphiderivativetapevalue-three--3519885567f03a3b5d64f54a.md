## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7e75b557-333e-a235-0a88-8b7fe6cb8a38`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 261–269.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem thetaPhiDerivativeTapeValue_three :
    thetaPhiDerivativeTapeValue 3 = thetaPhiRawD3 := by
  funext t
  have h := hasDerivAt_thetaPhiDerivativeTapeValue 2 t
  rw [thetaPhiDerivativeTapeValue_two] at h
  exact h.unique (hasDerivAt_thetaPhiRawD2 t)

/-- The fourth derivative in the all-order tape is the maintained raw fourth
source derivative. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ThetaPositiveLift/Variant34913b17f565acdb203280e319b2ea14c21212039e230cd657b881a117e387a9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ThetaPositiveLift/Variant34913b17f565acdb203280e319b2ea14c21212039e230cd657b881a117e387a9.lean#L261).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `195b8c00db2cec0332eedd0ed00f81067ba295e5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
