## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:48d7469c-626e-b584-0720-bb8663cc8d8f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 184–190.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem abs_deriv_le_one_of_mapsTo_ball (hd : DifferentiableOn ℂ f (ball c R))
    (h_maps : MapsTo f (ball c R) (ball c R)) (hc : f c = c) (h₀ : 0 < R) : abs (deriv f c) ≤ 1 :=
  (norm_deriv_le_div_of_mapsTo_ball hd (by rwa [hc]) h₀).trans_eq (div_self h₀.ne')
#align complex.abs_deriv_le_one_of_maps_to_ball Complex.abs_deriv_le_one_of_mapsTo_ball

/-- The **Schwarz Lemma**: if `f : ℂ → ℂ` sends an open disk to itself and the center `c` of this
disk to itself, then for any point `z` of this disk we have `dist (f z) c ≤ dist z c`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Schwarz/Variant6154b5a1ef954e192c2f2b2e4ae320b698d816f5bc4d6d18f0fb5bb965e26060.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Schwarz/Variant6154b5a1ef954e192c2f2b2e4ae320b698d816f5bc4d6d18f0fb5bb965e26060.lean#L184).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b8f8b2ef54822f2928d8978c6eef4444df342b57` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
