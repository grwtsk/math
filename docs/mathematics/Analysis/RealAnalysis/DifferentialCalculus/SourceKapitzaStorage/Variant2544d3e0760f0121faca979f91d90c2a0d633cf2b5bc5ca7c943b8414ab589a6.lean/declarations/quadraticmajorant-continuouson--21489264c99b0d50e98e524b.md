## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:066671a8-3dd1-d6bf-d0c8-0d01674104e3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 253–262.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem quadraticMajorant_continuousOn {y : ℝ} (hy : 1 ≤ y) :
    ContinuousOn quadraticMajorant (Set.uIcc 1 y) := by
  rw [Set.uIcc_of_le hy]
  intro x hx
  have hx0 : 0 < x := by linarith [hx.1]
  exact (((continuousAt_const.add (Real.continuousAt_log hx0.ne')).pow 2).div
    (Real.continuousAt_rpow_const x (3 / 2) (Or.inl hx0.ne'))
    (Real.rpow_pos_of_pos hx0 _).ne').continuousWithinAt

/-- Exact finite integral with its nonpositive terminal correction retained. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceKapitzaStorage/Variant2544d3e0760f0121faca979f91d90c2a0d633cf2b5bc5ca7c943b8414ab589a6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceKapitzaStorage/Variant2544d3e0760f0121faca979f91d90c2a0d633cf2b5bc5ca7c943b8414ab589a6.lean#L253).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c6843b65185653d9ec6136475dcd4275e45fb25e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
