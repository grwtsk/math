## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:670e1a90-3f6d-045a-f7f1-9eff3ea0e65e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1423–1427.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContDiffOn.mul {f g : E → 𝔸} (hf : ContDiffOn 𝕜 n f s) (hg : ContDiffOn 𝕜 n g s) :
    ContDiffOn 𝕜 n (fun x => f x * g x) s := fun x hx => (hf x hx).mul (hg x hx)
#align cont_diff_on.mul ContDiffOn.mul

/-- The product of two `C^n`functions is `C^n`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ContDiff/Variant79b6e36adebd0df455b6a8cd05bbbf98fe3247e74eb5a5f002d45ba8637512fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ContDiff/Variant79b6e36adebd0df455b6a8cd05bbbf98fe3247e74eb5a5f002d45ba8637512fa.lean#L1423).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `553658f7834248a1aec4dc8b24f9ab14e095928f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
