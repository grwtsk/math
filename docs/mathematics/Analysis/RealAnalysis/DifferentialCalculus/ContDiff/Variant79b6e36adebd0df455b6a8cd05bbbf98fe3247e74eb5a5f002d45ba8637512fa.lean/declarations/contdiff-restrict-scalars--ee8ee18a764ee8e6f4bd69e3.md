## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f1e4358d-4433-1057-2d2c-b65ba6801085`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2257–2268.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContDiff.restrict_scalars (h : ContDiff 𝕜' n f) : ContDiff 𝕜 n f :=
  contDiff_iff_contDiffAt.2 fun _ => h.contDiffAt.restrict_scalars _
#align cont_diff.restrict_scalars ContDiff.restrict_scalars

end RestrictScalars

/-!## Quantitative bounds -/

/-- Bounding the norm of the iterated derivative of `B (f x) (g x)` within a set in terms of the
iterated derivatives of `f` and `g` when `B` is bilinear. This lemma is an auxiliary version
assuming all spaces live in the same universe, to enable an induction. Use instead
`ContinuousLinearMap.norm_iteratedFDerivWithin_le_of_bilinear` that removes this assumption. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ContDiff/Variant79b6e36adebd0df455b6a8cd05bbbf98fe3247e74eb5a5f002d45ba8637512fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ContDiff/Variant79b6e36adebd0df455b6a8cd05bbbf98fe3247e74eb5a5f002d45ba8637512fa.lean#L2257).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `553658f7834248a1aec4dc8b24f9ab14e095928f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
