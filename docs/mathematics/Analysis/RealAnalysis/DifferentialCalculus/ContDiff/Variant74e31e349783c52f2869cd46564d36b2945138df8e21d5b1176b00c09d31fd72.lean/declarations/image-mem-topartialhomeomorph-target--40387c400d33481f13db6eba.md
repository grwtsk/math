## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8d8b221f-6dce-a098-3b7a-b1b1b74f0bf8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–58.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem image_mem_toPartialHomeomorph_target (hf : ContDiffAt 𝕂 n f a)
    (hf' : HasFDerivAt f (f' : E →L[𝕂] F) a) (hn : 1 ≤ n) :
    f a ∈ (hf.toPartialHomeomorph f hf' hn).target :=
  (hf.hasStrictFDerivAt' hf' hn).image_mem_toPartialHomeomorph_target

/-- Given a `ContDiff` function over `𝕂` (which is `ℝ` or `ℂ`) with an invertible derivative
at `a`, returns a function that is locally inverse to `f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ContDiff/Variant74e31e349783c52f2869cd46564d36b2945138df8e21d5b1176b00c09d31fd72.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ContDiff/Variant74e31e349783c52f2869cd46564d36b2945138df8e21d5b1176b00c09d31fd72.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `af60b4fe3fd323d003313bf62d4705b7e7cfb53b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
