## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:160362eb-c55b-3bb9-f911-6e42a4eecc97`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1770–1800.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ContDiffAt 𝕜 n inverse (e : E →L[𝕜] F) := by
  nontriviality E
  -- first, we use the lemma `to_ring_inverse` to rewrite in terms of `Ring.inverse` in the ring
  -- `E →L[𝕜] E`
  let O₁ : (E →L[𝕜] E) → F →L[𝕜] E := fun f => f.comp (e.symm : F →L[𝕜] E)
  let O₂ : (E →L[𝕜] F) → E →L[𝕜] E := fun f => (e.symm : F →L[𝕜] E).comp f

  -- `O₁` and `O₂` are `ContDiff`,
  -- so we reduce to proving that `Ring.inverse` is `ContDiff`

section FunctionInverse

open ContinuousLinearMap

/-- If `f` is a local homeomorphism and the point `a` is in its target,
and if `f` is `n` times continuously differentiable at `f.symm a`,
and if the derivative at `f.symm a` is a continuous linear equivalence,
then `f.symm` is `n` times continuously differentiable at the point `a`.

This is one of the easy parts of the inverse function theorem: it assumes that we already have
an inverse function. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ContDiff/Variant747445e1195aca45823aabea3b9c9876a35c825f90fe4078e9a9b4b731723fef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ContDiff/Variant747445e1195aca45823aabea3b9c9876a35c825f90fe4078e9a9b4b731723fef.lean#L1770).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c3f424fa48bdb95dad00a6c895134d683847e4c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
