## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:520b8159-e51b-a888-503d-f134c4f1659e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2195–2224.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ∀ (k : ℕ) {f₂ : 𝕜 → F}, ContDiff 𝕜 (n + k : ℕ) f₂ → ContDiff 𝕜 n (deriv^[k] f₂)
  | 0,     _, hf => hf
  | k + 1, _, hf => ContDiff.iterate_deriv' _ k (contDiff_succ_iff_deriv.mp hf).2

### Restricting from `ℂ` to `ℝ`, or generally from `𝕜'` to `𝕜`

If a function is `n` times continuously differentiable over `ℂ`, then it is `n` times continuously
differentiable over `ℝ`. In this paragraph, we give variants of this statement, in the general
situation where `ℂ` and `ℝ` are replaced respectively by `𝕜'` and `𝕜` where `𝕜'` is a normed algebra
over `𝕜`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ContDiff/Variant747445e1195aca45823aabea3b9c9876a35c825f90fe4078e9a9b4b731723fef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ContDiff/Variant747445e1195aca45823aabea3b9c9876a35c825f90fe4078e9a9b4b731723fef.lean#L2195).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c3f424fa48bdb95dad00a6c895134d683847e4c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
