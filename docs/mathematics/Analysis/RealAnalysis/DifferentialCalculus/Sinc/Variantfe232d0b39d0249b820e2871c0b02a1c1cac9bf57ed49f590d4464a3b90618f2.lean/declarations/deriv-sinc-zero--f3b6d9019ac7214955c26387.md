## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:730fe4f7-3156-0f7a-b735-603ec8b29249`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 184–200.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem deriv_sinc_zero : deriv sinc 0 = 0 := hasDerivAt_sinc_zero.deriv

/-
The derivative of sinc is bounded: |sinc'(x)| ≤ 1 for all x.

The key insight is that for x ≠ 0:
- sinc'(x) = (x cos x - sin x) / x²
- Let g(x) = x cos x - sin x. Then g(0) = 0 and g'(x) = -x sin x.
- |g(x)| = |∫₀ˣ -t sin t dt| ≤ ∫₀ˣ |t| dt = x²/2
- Therefore |sinc'(x)| = |g(x)|/x² ≤ 1/2 < 1

The proof using integration is mathematically straightforward but requires
formalizing the integral representation. Instead we use a direct monotonicity argument.

/-- Bound: |x cos x - sin x| ≤ x² for all x.
    Proof uses monotonicity of auxiliary functions on [0, ∞). -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Sinc/Variantfe232d0b39d0249b820e2871c0b02a1c1cac9bf57ed49f590d4464a3b90618f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Sinc/Variantfe232d0b39d0249b820e2871c0b02a1c1cac9bf57ed49f590d4464a3b90618f2.lean#L184).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `78e8fd84f810480297e8cf6dde76757f78c946e3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
