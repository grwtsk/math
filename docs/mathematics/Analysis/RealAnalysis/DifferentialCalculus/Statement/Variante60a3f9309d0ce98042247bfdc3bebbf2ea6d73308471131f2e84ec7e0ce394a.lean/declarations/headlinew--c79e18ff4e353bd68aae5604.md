## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:33b961a9eb93740cf801c3f1ce6b937b3adcb6d018fa7cedd8883201a68e5ea2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 392–398.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def HeadlineW (c cd : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∃ T₀ : ℝ, ∀ T : ℝ, T₀ ≤ T →
    c * (NcountW T (2 * T) : ℝ) ≤ (N0simpleW T (2 * T) : ℝ) ∧
    cd * (NcountW T (2 * T) : ℝ) ≤ (NdistW T (2 * T) : ℝ)

end XiPrime
end Zeta23
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Statement/Variante60a3f9309d0ce98042247bfdc3bebbf2ea6d73308471131f2e84ec7e0ce394a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Statement/Variante60a3f9309d0ce98042247bfdc3bebbf2ea6d73308471131f2e84ec7e0ce394a.lean#L392).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b1339c09f5e7b9f07de9a533850183e905d8c138` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
