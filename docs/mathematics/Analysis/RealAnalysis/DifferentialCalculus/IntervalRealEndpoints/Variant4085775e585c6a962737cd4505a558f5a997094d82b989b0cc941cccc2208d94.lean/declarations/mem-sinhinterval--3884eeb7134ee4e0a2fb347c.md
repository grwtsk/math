## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fc0289af-32eb-8fb5-2263-b4a918659cd3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 328–338.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_sinhInterval {x : ℝ} {I : IntervalReal} (hx : x ∈ I) :
    Real.sinh x ∈ sinhInterval I := by
  simp only [mem_def] at *
  simp only [sinhInterval]
  exact ⟨Real.sinh_le_sinh.mpr hx.1, Real.sinh_le_sinh.mpr hx.2⟩

/-- Interval bound for cosh.
    cosh is convex with minimum at 0:
    - If interval is all non-negative: cosh is increasing
    - If interval is all non-positive: cosh is decreasing
    - If interval contains 0: minimum is cosh(0) = 1, max is at endpoints -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/IntervalRealEndpoints/Variant4085775e585c6a962737cd4505a558f5a997094d82b989b0cc941cccc2208d94.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/IntervalRealEndpoints/Variant4085775e585c6a962737cd4505a558f5a997094d82b989b0cc941cccc2208d94.lean#L328).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a8bfe74749149205173be5f0435832353e0c6d91` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
