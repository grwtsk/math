## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5a947405-dcc1-7d61-6b21-cccf2ecdf208`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem unitBumpOverlap_eq_interval {u : ℝ} (hu : u∈Icc (0:ℝ) 2) :
    unitBumpOverlap u=∫ x in (u-1)..1,(1-x^2)^4*(1-(x-u)^2)^4 := by
  have he : (fun x : ℝ => sourceBump x*sourceBump (x-u))=
      (Icc (u-1) 1).indicator (fun x => (1-x^2)^4*(1-(x-u)^2)^4) := by

      simp [sourceBump,h1,h2,hx]

      · have h2 : x-u∉Icc (-1:ℝ) 1 := by
          intro h2
          exact hx ⟨by linarith [h2.1],h1.2⟩
        simp [sourceBump,h1,h2]
      · simp [sourceBump,h1]
  rw [unitBumpOverlap,he,zeroExtension_integral _ (u-1) 1 (by linarith [hu.2])]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourcePositivePrimitiveAttemptdebug05/Variant257d57430b1668ed44e58e538958fe21f8c4ac5e355981a9641eb2b8a9d8a287.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourcePositivePrimitiveAttemptdebug05/Variant257d57430b1668ed44e58e538958fe21f8c4ac5e355981a9641eb2b8a9d8a287.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6c80bedf1ac88f5b160a28a6fb46e2f68b3aaa8b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
