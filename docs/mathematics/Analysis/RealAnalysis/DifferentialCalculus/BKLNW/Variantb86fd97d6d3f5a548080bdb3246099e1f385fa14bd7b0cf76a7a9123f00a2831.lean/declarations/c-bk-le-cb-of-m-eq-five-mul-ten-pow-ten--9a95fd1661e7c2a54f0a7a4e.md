## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:90014836-88c2-c436-79bd-f10da5c4ed08`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1931–1938.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma C_bk_le_Cb_of_M_eq_five_mul_ten_pow_ten (b c C M : ℝ) (Cb : ℕ → ℝ) (h : (b, Cb 1, Cb 2, Cb 3, Cb 4, Cb 5, c, C, M) ∈ BKLNW.table_12) (k : ℕ) (hk : k ∈ Finset.Icc 1 5) (hM5 : M = 5 * 10 ^ 10) :

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/BKLNW/Variantb86fd97d6d3f5a548080bdb3246099e1f385fa14bd7b0cf76a7a9123f00a2831.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/BKLNW/Variantb86fd97d6d3f5a548080bdb3246099e1f385fa14bd7b0cf76a7a9123f00a2831.lean#L1931).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ffde19a257af38792c1e302adf6bb58acc6c98a4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
