## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:129f26e6186c9f2773e5c60429de25dbe2db8d7c1d7b1dedde842acc91ecfc47`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 693–704.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def Inputs.a₁ (I : Inputs) (b : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  if b ≤ 2 * log I.x₁ then 1 + I.ε (log I.x₁)
  else 1 + I.ε (b / 2)

@[blueprint
  "bklnw-def-a-2"
  (title := "Definition of a2")
  (statement := /--  $a_2$ is defined by
\[
a_2 = (1 + \alpha) \max\left( f(e^b), f(2^{\lfloor \frac{b}{\log 2} \rfloor + 1}) \right).
\]
 -/)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/BKLNW/Variant2e95d85ad29d82fb22d6efb68541d6912258c425aa729b3756c24aaf29cec103.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/BKLNW/Variant2e95d85ad29d82fb22d6efb68541d6912258c425aa729b3756c24aaf29cec103.lean#L693).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `31d573af61253eda377326baebeb36929353a168` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
