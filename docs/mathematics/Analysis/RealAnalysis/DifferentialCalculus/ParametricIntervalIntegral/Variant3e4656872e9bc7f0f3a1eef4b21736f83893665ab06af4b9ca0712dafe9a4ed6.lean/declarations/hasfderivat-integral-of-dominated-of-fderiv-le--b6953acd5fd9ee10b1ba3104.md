## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d69cf155-f436-c499-a40a-fd6cb9050aa4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Derivative under integral of `x ↦ ∫ F x a` at a given point `x₀ : 𝕜`, `𝕜 = ℝ` or `𝕜 = ℂ`,
assuming `F x₀` is integrable, `x ↦ F x a` is locally Lipschitz on a ball around `x₀` for ae `a`
(with ball radius independent of `a`) with integrable Lipschitz bound, and `F x` is
ae-measurable for `x` in a possibly smaller neighborhood of `x₀`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ParametricIntervalIntegral/Variant3e4656872e9bc7f0f3a1eef4b21736f83893665ab06af4b9ca0712dafe9a4ed6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ParametricIntervalIntegral/Variant3e4656872e9bc7f0f3a1eef4b21736f83893665ab06af4b9ca0712dafe9a4ed6.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0c95694a82624caca702ecac20b91ccf327dfc11` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
