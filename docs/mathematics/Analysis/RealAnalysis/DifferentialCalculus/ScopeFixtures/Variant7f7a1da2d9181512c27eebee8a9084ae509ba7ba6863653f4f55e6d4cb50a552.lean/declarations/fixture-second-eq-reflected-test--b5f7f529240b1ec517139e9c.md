## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e91075d8-5fc8-1a4e-c2ec-d0b9098cedb4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 22–36.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem fixture_second_eq_reflected_test {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) (y : ℝ) :
    deriv (deriv (boundaryPeano A)) y =
      peanoScale A * criticalPrimeTest A (2 * A - y) := by
  rw [boundaryPeano_second_deriv hA]
  unfold boundaryKernel peanoScale criticalPrimeTest
  have he : Real.exp (-A) * Real.exp ((2 * A - y) / 2) = Real.exp (-y / 2) := by
    rw [← Real.exp_add]
    congr 1
    ring
  calc
    _ = A ^ 9 * Real.exp (-y / 2) *
        sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A (2 * A - y) := by ring
    _ = _ := by rw [← he]; ring

/-- The exact adapter keeps its three literal hypotheses. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ScopeFixtures/Variant7f7a1da2d9181512c27eebee8a9084ae509ba7ba6863653f4f55e6d4cb50a552.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ScopeFixtures/Variant7f7a1da2d9181512c27eebee8a9084ae509ba7ba6863653f4f55e6d4cb50a552.lean#L22).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1f732fc186c1b9ff8ffba35a0ce5a4ced509dfb2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
