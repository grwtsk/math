## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8bb4d683-15a8-ff6b-792d-2a5e95ce1348`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 17–24.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rayValue_hasDerivAt (w : ℂ) (t : ℝ) :
    HasDerivAt (rayValue w) (raySlope w t) t := by
  have h := ((quartic_hasDerivAt ((t : ℂ)*w)).comp (t : ℂ)
    ((hasDerivAt_id (t : ℂ)).mul_const w)).comp_ofReal
  apply h.congr_deriv
  simp only [raySlope,one_mul]
  ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/QuarticBumpEnergy/Varianta263d947cda47cc27760d27d971746e9848dcf43427ae61b8c53255c019ed506.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/QuarticBumpEnergy/Varianta263d947cda47cc27760d27d971746e9848dcf43427ae61b8c53255c019ed506.lean#L17).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `98146d4a733ec24962d9077dceb75b7303eac8be` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
