## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ed9c6a6c-3017-7bd2-c13f-92ab26254c88`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 441–450.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma eventually_one_add_smoothingFn_pos : ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in atTop, 0 < 1 + ε n := by
  have h₁ := isLittleO_smoothingFn_one
  rw [isLittleO_iff] at h₁
  refine Eventually.natCast_atTop (p := fun n => 0 < 1 + ε n) ?_

  have : 0 < log x := Real.log_pos hx'
  show 0 < 1 + 1 / log x

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/AkraBazzi/Variant63ab822e1cd0c347eb485b039c341f8b10bdc831ec03617c8ee072a1d4b22403.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/AkraBazzi/Variant63ab822e1cd0c347eb485b039c341f8b10bdc831ec03617c8ee072a1d4b22403.lean#L441).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `470ce2f8aaada3e7158edb7db4dcdb2e3543282e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
