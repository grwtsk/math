## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b9dce060-f2ad-5e79-9051-09443eb5ddeb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 608–612.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem HasDerivWithinAt.clm_comp (hc : HasDerivWithinAt c c' s x)
    (hd : HasDerivWithinAt d d' s x) :
    HasDerivWithinAt (fun y => (c y).comp (d y)) (c'.comp (d x) + (c x).comp d') s x := by
  simpa [add_comm] using (hc.hasFDerivWithinAt.clm_comp hd.hasFDerivWithinAt).hasDerivWithinAt

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Mul/Variant1a6dfd6b88022ebd44c987f2a8dc3f92bcc36af4873eb4c7b7302c4cb94eaf29.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Mul/Variant1a6dfd6b88022ebd44c987f2a8dc3f92bcc36af4873eb4c7b7302c4cb94eaf29.lean#L608).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d8b267ca9b23d890e9131c26060b4c917df7fa00` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
