## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5f2c86ac-bec1-915c-51bd-c64dee17cf17`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 620–625.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem DifferentiableWithinAt.inv' (hf : DifferentiableWithinAt 𝕜 h S z) (hz : h z ≠ 0) :
    DifferentiableWithinAt 𝕜 (fun x => (h x)⁻¹) S z :=
  (differentiableAt_inv' hz).comp_differentiableWithinAt z hf
#align differentiable_within_at.inv' DifferentiableWithinAt.inv'

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Mul/Variant031015f5462b6496bd0f49183bda5f48de6e10c2ca22b32798b8d367cfc6015b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Mul/Variant031015f5462b6496bd0f49183bda5f48de6e10c2ca22b32798b8d367cfc6015b.lean#L620).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `85508b43238d1779ea9fb3a83c4e1da9e3492be3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
