## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5ea491d9-d369-e0a9-4172-c88e7c80bb46`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 85–93.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem normalizedMain_hasDerivAt {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) :
    HasDerivAt (fun B ↦ diagonalMainCoefficient B * B)
      (normalizationMainDerivative A) A := by
  have hd := (diagonalMainCoefficient_hasDerivAt hA).mul (hasDerivAt_id A)
  convert hd using 1 <;> first
    | rfl
    | (dsimp [normalizationMainDerivative, diagonalCoefficientDerivative]; ring)

/-- The literal positive-axis diagonal main contribution is locally C¹. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceMainTermScaleDerivative/Variantc366cb753d8bd9f44f2d186685b27a10813f1a6767d788312214aef72a2952e3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceMainTermScaleDerivative/Variantc366cb753d8bd9f44f2d186685b27a10813f1a6767d788312214aef72a2952e3.lean#L85).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1906f0c7624bac4739845459d2509a79ab07fa6d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
