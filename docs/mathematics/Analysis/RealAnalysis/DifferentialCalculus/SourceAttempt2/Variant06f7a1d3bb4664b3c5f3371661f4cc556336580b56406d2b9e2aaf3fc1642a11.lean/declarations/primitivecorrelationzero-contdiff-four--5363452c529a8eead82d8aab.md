## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:357bde9e-ef26-67c8-4eb5-15277890de5b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–141.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem primitiveCorrelationZero_contDiff_four {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) :
    ContDiff ℝ 4 (primitiveCorrelationZero A) := by
  have hc2 := primitiveCorrelationZero_contDiff_two hA
  have hd2 : ContDiff ℝ 2 (deriv (deriv (primitiveCorrelationZero A))) := by
    have he : deriv (deriv (primitiveCorrelationZero A)) =
        fun t => -primitiveCorrelationOne A t :=
      funext (primitiveCorrelationZero_second_deriv_eq_neg_one hA)
    rw [he]
    exact (primitiveCorrelationOne_contDiff_two hA).neg
  have hd3 : ContDiff ℝ 3 (deriv (primitiveCorrelationZero A)) := by
    rw [show (3 : WithTop ℕ∞) = 2 + 1 from rfl, contDiff_succ_iff_deriv]
    exact ⟨hc2.deriv'.differentiable (by norm_num), by norm_num, hd2⟩
  rw [show (4 : WithTop ℕ∞) = 3 + 1 from rfl, contDiff_succ_iff_deriv]
  exact ⟨hc2.differentiable (by norm_num), by norm_num, hd3⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceAttempt2/Variant06f7a1d3bb4664b3c5f3371661f4cc556336580b56406d2b9e2aaf3fc1642a11.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SourceAttempt2/Variant06f7a1d3bb4664b3c5f3371661f4cc556336580b56406d2b9e2aaf3fc1642a11.lean#L126).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `60920b5b6fba20a31e1d2257ce644452cb0820eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
