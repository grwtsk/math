## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7df9eb4b-7159-2bf9-c1dd-48c60f7737d6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 455–466.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem A_mem_nhdsGT {L : F} {r ε x : ℝ} (hx : x ∈ A f L r ε) : A f L r ε ∈ 𝓝[>] x := by
  rcases hx with ⟨r', rr', hr'⟩
  obtain ⟨s, s_gt, s_lt⟩ : ∃ s : ℝ, r / 2 < s ∧ s < r' := exists_between rr'.1
  have : s ∈ Ioc (r / 2) r := ⟨s_gt, le_of_lt (s_lt.trans_le rr'.2)⟩
  filter_upwards [Ioo_mem_nhdsGT <| show x < x + r' - s by linarith] with x' hx'
  use s, this
  have A : Icc x' (x' + s) ⊆ Icc x (x + r') := by
    apply Icc_subset_Icc hx'.1.le
    linarith [hx'.2]
  intro y hy z hz
  exact hr' y (A hy) z (A hz)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Measurable/Variantf0da8ee15844c80a230705220fd9f39f89b399b42fa1232c877c140c4ef21620.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Measurable/Variantf0da8ee15844c80a230705220fd9f39f89b399b42fa1232c877c140c4ef21620.lean#L455).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b13390f0aee1019879e01d496581048f13b5488d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
