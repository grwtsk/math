## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f1a9645c-ab1c-aada-9659-4f13be37a739`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 297–305.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem normalizedOperator_square_integral {h : ℝ → ℝ} (hc : ContDiff ℝ 2 h)
    (hs : HasCompactSupport h) (hn : ∃ x, h x ≠ 0) {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) :
    (∫ x : ℝ, (normalizedOperator h A x) ^ 2) = 1 := by
  have hz := normalization_pos hc hs hn hA
  simp_rw [normalizedOperator, div_pow, Real.sq_sqrt hz.le]
  rw [integral_div]
  exact div_self hz.ne'

/-- The unit-normalized operator and its square are integrable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/CompactProfileNormalization.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Calculus/CompactProfileNormalization.lean#L297).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `be1e5042ecc6aefd5ea86e7f63837b441e9846ea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
