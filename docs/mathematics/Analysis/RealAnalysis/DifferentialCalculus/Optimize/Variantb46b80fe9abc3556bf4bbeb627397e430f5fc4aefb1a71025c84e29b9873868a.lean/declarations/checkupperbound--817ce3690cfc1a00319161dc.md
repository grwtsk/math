## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d704fe6f52a1f1f6891fda37497ab9ff2a2c50e8c9b2eae4426dfede2fe9bd93`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 400–422.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def checkUpperBound (e : Expr) (I : IntervalRat) (c : ℚ) (varIdx : Nat)
    (maxDepth : ℕ) : Bool :=
  let result := maximizeInterval e I varIdx maxDepth
  result.valueBound.hi ≤ c

/-! ## N-Variable Optimization Infrastructure

The following section provides generalized optimization infrastructure that works
with arbitrary variable indices and multi-variable environments. This allows
optimizing along any coordinate while holding other variables fixed.

Key types:
- `IntervalEnv := Nat → IntervalRat` - maps variable indices to intervals
- `evalAlong e ρ idx` - evaluates `e` as a function of variable `idx`

The main advantage is that we can now optimize expressions with multiple variables
by fixing all but one variable and optimizing along that coordinate.

/-! ### N-variable derivative bounds -/

/-- If the derivative interval along `idx` is strictly positive, derivative is positive everywhere.
    Generalized version that works with any variable index and environment. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Optimize/Variantb46b80fe9abc3556bf4bbeb627397e430f5fc4aefb1a71025c84e29b9873868a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Optimize/Variantb46b80fe9abc3556bf4bbeb627397e430f5fc4aefb1a71025c84e29b9873868a.lean#L400).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9ca70cedf89542b60ae036f418c0b4be33db63fc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
