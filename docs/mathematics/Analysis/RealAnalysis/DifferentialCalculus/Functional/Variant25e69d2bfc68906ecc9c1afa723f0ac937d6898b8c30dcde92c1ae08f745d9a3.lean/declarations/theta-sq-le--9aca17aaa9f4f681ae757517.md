## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:af94da36-8c2e-bed8-0db3-99331713b1bf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 82–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem theta_sq_le {lam : ℝ} (h0 : 0 ≤ lam) (h1 : lam ≤ 1) : theta lam ^ 2 ≤ 1 / 2 := by
  have h := theta_le h1 h0
  have h2 : ((Real.sqrt 2)⁻¹) ^ 2 = 1 / 2 := by
    rw [inv_pow, Real.sq_sqrt (by norm_num : (0:ℝ) ≤ 2)]
    norm_num
  calc theta lam ^ 2 ≤ ((Real.sqrt 2)⁻¹) ^ 2 := pow_le_pow_left₀ (theta_nonneg h0) h 2
    _ = 1 / 2 := h2

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Functional/Variant25e69d2bfc68906ecc9c1afa723f0ac937d6898b8c30dcde92c1ae08f745d9a3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Functional/Variant25e69d2bfc68906ecc9c1afa723f0ac937d6898b8c30dcde92c1ae08f745d9a3.lean#L82).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `42291c6dafca5e513a306ef3953a2e7f7d1f43f0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
