## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0bcc0166-02dd-03f3-3e4f-40a15c3b507a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 228–236.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cStar_continuousOn : ContinuousOn cStar (Set.Icc 0 1) := by
  have hnum : Continuous fun lam : ℝ => Real.sqrt 2 * Real.sin (theta lam) := by unfold theta; fun_prop
  have hden : Continuous fun lam : ℝ => Real.cos (theta lam) + theta lam * Real.sin (theta lam) := by
    unfold theta; fun_prop
  refine (hnum.continuousOn.div hden.continuousOn fun lam hlam => ?_).congr fun lam _ => rfl
  have := cStar_denom_ge hlam.1 hlam.2

/-- c* in the paper's tan form [eq:vstar] (cos ϑ ≠ 0 on the range). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Functional/Variant25e69d2bfc68906ecc9c1afa723f0ac937d6898b8c30dcde92c1ae08f745d9a3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Functional/Variant25e69d2bfc68906ecc9c1afa723f0ac937d6898b8c30dcde92c1ae08f745d9a3.lean#L228).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `42291c6dafca5e513a306ef3953a2e7f7d1f43f0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
