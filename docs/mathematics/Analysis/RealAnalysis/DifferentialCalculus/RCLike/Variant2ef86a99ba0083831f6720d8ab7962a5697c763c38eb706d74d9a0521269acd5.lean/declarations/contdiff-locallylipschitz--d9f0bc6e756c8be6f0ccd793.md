## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c14ec42a-01ed-185e-8876-1682d6be13ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 151–156.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma ContDiff.locallyLipschitz {f : E' → F'} (hf : ContDiff 𝕂 1 f) : LocallyLipschitz f := by
  intro x
  rcases hf.contDiffAt.exists_lipschitzOnWith with ⟨K, t, ht, hf⟩
  use K, t

/-- If `f` is `C¹` on a convex compact set `s`, it is Lipschitz on `s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/RCLike/Variant2ef86a99ba0083831f6720d8ab7962a5697c763c38eb706d74d9a0521269acd5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/RCLike/Variant2ef86a99ba0083831f6720d8ab7962a5697c763c38eb706d74d9a0521269acd5.lean#L151).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `34c5a1a1daa5f40a2a783207e16f610c9c9367f8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
