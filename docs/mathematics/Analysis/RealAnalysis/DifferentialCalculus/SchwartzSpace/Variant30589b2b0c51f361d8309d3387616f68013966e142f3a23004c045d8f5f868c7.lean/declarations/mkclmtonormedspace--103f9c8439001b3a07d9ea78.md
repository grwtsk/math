## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c295031a7938043588810a75d3c91f8e989c9344e227fe0f3532f529cc5b9c63`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 745–768.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (hsmul : ∀ (a : 𝕜) (f : 𝓢(D, E)), A (a • f) = σ a • A f)
    (hbound : ∃ (s : Finset (ℕ × ℕ)) (C : ℝ), 0 ≤ C ∧ ∀ (f : 𝓢(D, E)),

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SchwartzSpace/Variant30589b2b0c51f361d8309d3387616f68013966e142f3a23004c045d8f5f868c7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SchwartzSpace/Variant30589b2b0c51f361d8309d3387616f68013966e142f3a23004c045d8f5f868c7.lean#L745).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6a1f9f3d5dc8594c97f095b99298437b6a095ccf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
