## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:82d9982fbaf7d5f214e703e291a28922d58d8df2aba1acd2d9ea433342ec7084`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 84–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure SchwartzMap where
  toFun : E → F
  smooth' : ContDiff ℝ ∞ toFun
  decay' : ∀ k n : ℕ, ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ x, ‖x‖ ^ k * ‖iteratedFDeriv ℝ n toFun x‖ ≤ C

/-- A function is a Schwartz function if it is smooth and all derivatives decay faster than
  any power of `‖x‖`. -/
scoped[SchwartzMap] notation "𝓢(" E ", " F ")" => SchwartzMap E F

namespace SchwartzMap

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SchwartzSpace/Variant1ae361bbe724f1fe713c22e1a819a1cb73947b5a7060d09e857a3c52d0386f77.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SchwartzSpace/Variant1ae361bbe724f1fe713c22e1a819a1cb73947b5a7060d09e857a3c52d0386f77.lean#L84).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e75c6e687d9eb08e82647fa3303034476aa82b79` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
