## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b96efe8c2a07c203232c10853f7d6195c0543b301d78da14bb1e83f8873107a5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 74–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def coshCore (d : DualInterval) (n : ℕ := 10) : DualInterval :=
  { val := IntervalRat.coshComputable d.val n
    der := IntervalRat.mul (IntervalRat.sinhComputable d.val n) d.der }

/-- Computable dual for tanh (chain rule: d(tanh f) = sech²(f) * f')
    Since sech²(x) ∈ (0, 1], we use [0, 1] as a conservative bound. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Computable/Variantf698bdada2ec90cb42ae6e4b21a6cac8d6a6d65bfbd895137e9f4a44d2bdfc29.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Computable/Variantf698bdada2ec90cb42ae6e4b21a6cac8d6a6d65bfbd895137e9f4a44d2bdfc29.lean#L74).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `747babc0407118a18da9ff930c8c65b2fc3ff6ad` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
