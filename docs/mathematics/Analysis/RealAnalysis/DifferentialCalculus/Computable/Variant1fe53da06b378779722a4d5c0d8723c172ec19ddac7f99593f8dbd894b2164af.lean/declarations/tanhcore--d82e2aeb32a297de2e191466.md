## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e4849a94194c184178c7d5648bc9abab281f48c1a2a64d676407c9ccefec3567`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 88–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def tanhCore (d : DualInterval) (_n : ℕ := 10) : DualInterval :=
  { val := tanhInterval d.val
    -- tanh'(x) = sech²(x) ∈ (0, 1], use [0, 1] as bound
    der := IntervalRat.mul d.der ⟨0, 1, by norm_num⟩ }

end DualInterval

/-- Computable dual interval evaluator for ExprSupportedCore expressions.

    This uses Taylor series approximations for transcendental functions,
    making it fully computable and usable with `native_decide`.

    For expressions outside `ExprSupportedCore` (inv, log, atanh), use `evalDual?`
    for domain-checked evaluation; correctness is not covered here. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Computable/Variant1fe53da06b378779722a4d5c0d8723c172ec19ddac7f99593f8dbd894b2164af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Computable/Variant1fe53da06b378779722a4d5c0d8723c172ec19ddac7f99593f8dbd894b2164af.lean#L88).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `48946ce5b950b9ecdd33380adfc507b2693278e8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
