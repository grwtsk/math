## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7d28863f-ff4c-8b5c-e45a-f9aa8dc59b42`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 285–293.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem complexOfReal_derivWithin (h₁ : DifferentiableWithinAt ℝ f s x)
    (h₂ : fderivWithin ℝ f s x I = I • fderivWithin ℝ f s x 1) (hs : UniqueDiffWithinAt ℂ s x) :
    derivWithin f s x = fderivWithin ℝ f s x 1 :=
  HasDerivWithinAt.derivWithin (complexOfReal_hasDerivWithinAt h₁ h₂) hs

/--
The **Cauchy-Riemann Equation**: A real-differentiable function `f` on `ℂ` is complex-differentiable
at `x` if and only if the derivative `fderiv ℝ f x` maps `I` to `I • (fderiv ℝ f x) 1`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Conformal/Variant41e7e2aaa497ce95634cf00bbd642ddc6c68574f439a6a397c85ca64ff5199b8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Conformal/Variant41e7e2aaa497ce95634cf00bbd642ddc6c68574f439a6a397c85ca64ff5199b8.lean#L285).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `627511b4b28067f5ecb9658033aa3c16f4738bda` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
