## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0726e911-0db7-488c-55d0-705fb1b49744`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 106–111.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem HasFDerivAt.inner (hf : HasFDerivAt f f' x) (hg : HasFDerivAt g g' x) :
    HasFDerivAt (fun t => ⟪f t, g t⟫) ((fderivInnerCLM 𝕜 (f x, g x)).comp <| f'.prod g') x := by
  -- `by exact` to handle a tricky unification.
  exact isBoundedBilinearMap_inner (𝕜 := 𝕜) (E := E)
    |>.hasFDerivAt (f x, g x) |>.comp x (hf.prodMk hg)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Calculus/Variant4212e4a12ae65fa61a7422c686c095285dd7be88ed2fc81a690bd3a8008a0bb6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Calculus/Variant4212e4a12ae65fa61a7422c686c095285dd7be88ed2fc81a690bd3a8008a0bb6.lean#L106).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d6e141a1adc85ad8c91812d80f7a60e8c733f0d8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
