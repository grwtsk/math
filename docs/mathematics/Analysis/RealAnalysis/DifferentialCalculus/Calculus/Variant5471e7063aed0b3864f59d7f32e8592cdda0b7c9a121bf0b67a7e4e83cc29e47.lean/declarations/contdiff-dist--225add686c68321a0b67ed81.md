## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:32aa6678-22b6-4163-c2fe-76838cf49034`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 224–229.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContDiff.dist (hf : ContDiff ℝ n f) (hg : ContDiff ℝ n g) (hne : ∀ x, f x ≠ g x) :
    ContDiff ℝ n fun y => dist (f y) (g y) :=
  contDiff_iff_contDiffAt.2 fun x => hf.contDiffAt.dist 𝕜 hg.contDiffAt (hne x)
#align cont_diff.dist ContDiff.dist

-- porting note: use `2 •` instead of `bit0`
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Calculus/Variant5471e7063aed0b3864f59d7f32e8592cdda0b7c9a121bf0b67a7e4e83cc29e47.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Calculus/Variant5471e7063aed0b3864f59d7f32e8592cdda0b7c9a121bf0b67a7e4e83cc29e47.lean#L224).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6a99336faa5fbbe2832fd98d5d6fe605a23e1a25` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
