## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c9b65fed-5fe8-e0e7-5079-5b8726923f6b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1170–1178.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem contDiffOn_succ_iff_fderiv_of_open {n : ℕ} (hs : IsOpen s) :
    ContDiffOn 𝕜 (n + 1 : ℕ) f s ↔
      DifferentiableOn 𝕜 f s ∧ ContDiffOn 𝕜 n (fun y => fderiv 𝕜 f y) s := by
  rw [contDiffOn_succ_iff_fderivWithin hs.uniqueDiffOn]
  exact Iff.rfl.and (contDiffOn_congr fun x hx ↦ fderivWithin_of_open hs hx)
#align cont_diff_on_succ_iff_fderiv_of_open contDiffOn_succ_iff_fderiv_of_open

/-- A function is `C^∞` on a domain with unique derivatives if and only if it is differentiable
there, and its derivative (expressed with `fderivWithin`) is `C^∞`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ContDiffDef/Variant3c3196e75ec179d4a374d122afc544dd7c900bd57634bd0b797c4098f0b5021f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/ContDiffDef/Variant3c3196e75ec179d4a374d122afc544dd7c900bd57634bd0b797c4098f0b5021f.lean#L1170).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `40b673d2a4a18360984ddc9c8558d622a443ccf7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
