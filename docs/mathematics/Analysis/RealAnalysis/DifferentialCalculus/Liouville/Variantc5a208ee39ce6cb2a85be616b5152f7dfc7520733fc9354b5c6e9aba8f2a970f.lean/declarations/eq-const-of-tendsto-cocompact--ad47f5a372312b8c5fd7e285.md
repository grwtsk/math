## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c539285c-60d8-9297-ec8d-5f4ba1ec1d2e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 133–147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (hb : Tendsto f (cocompact E) (𝓝 c)) : f = Function.const E c := by
  have h_bdd : Bornology.IsBounded (Set.range f) := by
    obtain ⟨s, hs, hs_bdd⟩ := Metric.exists_isBounded_image_of_tendsto hb
    obtain ⟨t, ht, hts⟩ := mem_cocompact.mp hs
    apply ht.image hf.continuous |>.isBounded.union hs_bdd |>.subset
    simpa [Set.image_union, Set.image_univ] using Set.image_subset _ <| calc
      Set.univ = t ∪ tᶜ := t.union_compl_self.symm
      _        ⊆ t ∪ s  := by gcongr
  obtain ⟨c', hc'⟩ := hf.exists_eq_const_of_bounded h_bdd
  convert hc'
  exact tendsto_nhds_unique hb (by simpa [hc'] using tendsto_const_nhds)

/-- A corollary of Liouville's theorem where the function tends to a finite value at infinity
(i.e., along `Filter.cocompact`, which in proper spaces coincides with `Bornology.cobounded`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Liouville/Variantc5a208ee39ce6cb2a85be616b5152f7dfc7520733fc9354b5c6e9aba8f2a970f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Liouville/Variantc5a208ee39ce6cb2a85be616b5152f7dfc7520733fc9354b5c6e9aba8f2a970f.lean#L133).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `76b8e66cf88bb3cddfd967f414ca23724babe49c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
