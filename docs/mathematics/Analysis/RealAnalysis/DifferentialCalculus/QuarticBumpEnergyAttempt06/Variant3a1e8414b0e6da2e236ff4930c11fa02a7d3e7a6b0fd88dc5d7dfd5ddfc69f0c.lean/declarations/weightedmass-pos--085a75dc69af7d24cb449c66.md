## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:83f29d5e-1abc-8fd1-c131-276c6c50d89c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 70–84.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  let t : ℝ := min e 1 / 2
  have hm0 : 0 < min e 1 := lt_min he (by norm_num)
  have ht0 : 0 < t := div_pos hm0 (by norm_num)
  have ht1 : t ≤ 1 := by have := min_le_right e 1; dsimp [t]; linarith
  have hte : t < e := by have := min_le_left e 1; dsimp [t]; linarith
  have htne : rayValue w t ≠ 0 := hball (by simpa [Metric.mem_ball,Real.dist_eq,abs_of_pos ht0] using hte)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/QuarticBumpEnergyAttempt06/Variant3a1e8414b0e6da2e236ff4930c11fa02a7d3e7a6b0fd88dc5d7dfd5ddfc69f0c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/QuarticBumpEnergyAttempt06/Variant3a1e8414b0e6da2e236ff4930c11fa02a7d3e7a6b0fd88dc5d7dfd5ddfc69f0c.lean#L70).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `14c85c682f11c3d04f09563376455c394de9e07c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
