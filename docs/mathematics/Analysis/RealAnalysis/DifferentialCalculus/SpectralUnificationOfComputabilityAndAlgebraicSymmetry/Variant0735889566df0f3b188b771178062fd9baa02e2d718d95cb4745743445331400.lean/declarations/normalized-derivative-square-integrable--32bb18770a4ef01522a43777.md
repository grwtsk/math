## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3fc1aa1c-cd30-46b2-81f0-ec3f98262947`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 115–124.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean

    Integrable (fun x ↦ deriv (normalizedTest explicitSecondDerivative A) x ^ 2) := by

  have hc := (normalizedTest_contDiff A hAp).continuous_deriv (by norm_num)
  have hs := (normalizedTest_hasCompactSupport A hAp).deriv

    simpa only [pow_two] using hs.mul_right
      (f' := deriv (normalizedTest explicitSecondDerivative A)))

/-- Exact energy for the ordinary derivative, including the endpoint-matched zero extension. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variant0735889566df0f3b188b771178062fd9baa02e2d718d95cb4745743445331400.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Variant0735889566df0f3b188b771178062fd9baa02e2d718d95cb4745743445331400.lean#L115).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a3ce924ae399b2ba2a33e5dbe69ace579e57055` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
