## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7e7a5b9a-9e0f-baf3-2c4a-24b3abeede85`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem normalizedSourceBump_pole_operator (A x : ℝ) (hA : 0 < A) :
    deriv (deriv (normalizedSourceBump A)) x - normalizedSourceBump A x / 4 =
      normalizedTest explicitSecondDerivative A x := by
  rw [normalizedSourceBump_second_deriv A x hA]
  unfold normalizedSourceBump normalizedTest dilationTest
  ring

/-- Compact support is established from the actual indicator source. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Varianta99c703f58bddd473d930a9868fe5c95d20a1553a9e6f476e7d3d8f8cb0dc8fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/SpectralUnificationOfComputabilityAndAlgebraicSymmetry/Varianta99c703f58bddd473d930a9868fe5c95d20a1553a9e6f476e7d3d8f8cb0dc8fa.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d2871a225e8650ceab8fef35f2dcfb68c8d97473` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
