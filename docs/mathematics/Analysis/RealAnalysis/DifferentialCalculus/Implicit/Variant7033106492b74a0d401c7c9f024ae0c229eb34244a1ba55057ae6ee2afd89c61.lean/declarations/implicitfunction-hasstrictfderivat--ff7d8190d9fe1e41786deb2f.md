## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ea87a12c-7f17-ce26-636d-fa059bdaf847`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 188–229.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Case of a complemented kernel

In this section we prove the following version of the implicit function theorem. Consider a map
`f : E → F` and a point `a : E` such that `f` is strictly differentiable at `a`, its derivative `f'`
is surjective and the kernel of `f'` is a complemented subspace of `E` (i.e., it has a closed
complementary subspace). Then there exists a function `φ : F → ker f' → E` such that for `(y, z)`
close to `(f a, 0)` we have `f (φ y z) = y` and the derivative of `φ (f a)` at zero is the
embedding `ker f' → E`.

Note that a map with these properties is not unique. E.g., different choices of a subspace
complementary to `ker f'` lead to different maps `φ`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Implicit/Variant7033106492b74a0d401c7c9f024ae0c229eb34244a1ba55057ae6ee2afd89c61.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Implicit/Variant7033106492b74a0d401c7c9f024ae0c229eb34244a1ba55057ae6ee2afd89c61.lean#L188).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9041a0b914f7af8fb9453c954100493318e6a573` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
