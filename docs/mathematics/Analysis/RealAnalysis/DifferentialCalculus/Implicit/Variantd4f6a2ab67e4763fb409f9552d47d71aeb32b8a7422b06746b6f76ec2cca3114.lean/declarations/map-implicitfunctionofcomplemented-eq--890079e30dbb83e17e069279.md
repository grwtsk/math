## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bbaf1803-bf1e-29e3-27b6-027797e5cbbe`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 395–404.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_implicitFunctionOfComplemented_eq (hf : HasStrictFDerivAt f f' a) (hf' : f'.range = ⊤)
    (hker : f'.ker.ClosedComplemented) :
    ∀ᶠ p : F × f'.ker in 𝓝 (f a, 0),
      f (hf.implicitFunctionOfComplemented f f' hf' hker p.1 p.2) = p.1 :=
  ((hf.implicitToOpenPartialHomeomorphOfComplemented f f' hf' hker).eventually_right_inverse <|
        hf.mem_implicitToOpenPartialHomeomorphOfComplemented_target hf' hker).mono
    fun ⟨_, _⟩ h => congr_arg Prod.fst h

/-- Any point in some neighborhood of `a` can be represented as
`HasStrictFDerivAt.implicitFunctionOfComplemented` of some point. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Implicit/Variantd4f6a2ab67e4763fb409f9552d47d71aeb32b8a7422b06746b6f76ec2cca3114.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Implicit/Variantd4f6a2ab67e4763fb409f9552d47d71aeb32b8a7422b06746b6f76ec2cca3114.lean#L395).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e01ca0232714d36187f0400ac0ac31d0f61b4340` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
