## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3139efe4-9584-6a63-3bef-bd328c504245`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 420–464.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Finite-dimensional case

In this section we prove the following version of the implicit function theorem. Consider a map
`f : E → F` from a Banach normed space to a finite-dimensional space.
Take a point `a : E` such that `f` is strictly differentiable at `a` and its derivative `f'`
is surjective. Then there exists a function `φ : F → ker f' → E` such that for `(y, z)`
close to `(f a, 0)` we have `f (φ y z) = y` and the derivative of `φ (f a)` at zero is the
embedding `ker f' → E`.

This version deduces that `ker f'` is a complemented subspace from the fact that `F` is a finite
dimensional space, then applies the previous version.

Note that a map with these properties is not unique. E.g., different choices of a subspace
complementary to `ker f'` lead to different maps `φ`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Implicit/Variantd4f6a2ab67e4763fb409f9552d47d71aeb32b8a7422b06746b6f76ec2cca3114.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
