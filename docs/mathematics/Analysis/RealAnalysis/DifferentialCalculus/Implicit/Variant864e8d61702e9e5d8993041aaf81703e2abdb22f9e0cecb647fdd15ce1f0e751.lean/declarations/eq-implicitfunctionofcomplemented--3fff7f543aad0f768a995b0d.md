## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ed2361b0-ca3f-9610-b65d-f62df32f387d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 313–319.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_implicitFunctionOfComplemented (hf : HasStrictFDerivAt f f' a) (hf' : range f' = ⊤)
    (hker : (ker f').ClosedComplemented) :
    ∀ᶠ x in 𝓝 a, hf.implicitFunctionOfComplemented f f' hf' hker (f x)
      (hf.implicitToPartialHomeomorphOfComplemented f f' hf' hker x).snd = x :=
  (implicitFunctionDataOfComplemented f f' hf hf' hker).implicitFunction_apply_image

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Implicit/Variant864e8d61702e9e5d8993041aaf81703e2abdb22f9e0cecb647fdd15ce1f0e751.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Implicit/Variant864e8d61702e9e5d8993041aaf81703e2abdb22f9e0cecb647fdd15ce1f0e751.lean#L313).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aa49e5c0efcb7a90d029cca2f64b0d3b8be1a1e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
