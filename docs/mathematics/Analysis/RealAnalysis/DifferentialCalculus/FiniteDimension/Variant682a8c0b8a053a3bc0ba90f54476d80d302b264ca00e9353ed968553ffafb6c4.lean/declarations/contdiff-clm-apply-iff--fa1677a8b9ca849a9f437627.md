## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a8878923-1708-68b7-2a4b-b8cd689af9a0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–67.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem contDiff_clm_apply_iff {f : D → E →L[𝕜] F} [FiniteDimensional 𝕜 E] :
    ContDiff 𝕜 n f ↔ ∀ y, ContDiff 𝕜 n fun x => f x y := by
  simp_rw [← contDiffOn_univ, contDiffOn_clm_apply]

/-- This is a useful lemma to prove that a certain operation preserves functions being `C^n`.
When you do induction on `n`, this gives a useful characterization of a function being `C^(n+1)`,
assuming you have already computed the derivative. The advantage of this version over
`contDiff_succ_iff_fderiv` is that both occurrences of `ContDiff` are for functions with the same
domain and codomain (`D` and `E`). This is not the case for `contDiff_succ_iff_fderiv`, which
often requires an inconvenient need to generalize `F`, which results in universe issues
(see the discussion in the section of `ContDiff.comp`).

This lemma avoids these universe issues, but only applies for finite dimensional `D`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/FiniteDimension/Variant682a8c0b8a053a3bc0ba90f54476d80d302b264ca00e9353ed968553ffafb6c4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/FiniteDimension/Variant682a8c0b8a053a3bc0ba90f54476d80d302b264ca00e9353ed968553ffafb6c4.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0896f0020a08a42159ea80981eb23d6e494e691b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
