## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ab3e4ec2-108c-f0d2-dce0-eedd3835c8f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 348–361.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actual_cutoff_prime_two_packet_zero_pos :
    0 < cutoffPrimeSquareCosinePacket 2 2 0 := by
  have hexp : (5 : ℝ) < Real.exp 4 := by
    have h := Real.add_one_lt_exp (by norm_num : (4 : ℝ) ≠ 0)
    norm_num at h
    exact h
  have hp := prime_mem_lower_power_inventory (by decide : Nat.Prime 2) 2
    (show (2 : ℝ) < Real.exp (2 * 2) by norm_num; linarith)
  have hp2 := prime_square_mem_lower_power_inventory (by decide : Nat.Prime 2) 2
    (show ((2 ^ 2 : ℕ) : ℝ) < Real.exp (2 * 2) by norm_num; linarith)
  rw [cutoff_prime_square_cosine_packet_eq 2 2 0 hp hp2]
  exact prime_square_cosine_packet_zero_pos (by decide)

/-- The actual packet cannot have a universal nonpositive pointwise sign. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/PhaseDeformationQuantities/Variant7e687a5610aad34834c8aa3f863a21d780144fd1835855669f540ca0bce12548.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/PhaseDeformationQuantities/Variant7e687a5610aad34834c8aa3f863a21d780144fd1835855669f540ca0bce12548.lean#L348).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `072bd8093642a9de5f3c5c7fc16e025d0ce95e0e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
