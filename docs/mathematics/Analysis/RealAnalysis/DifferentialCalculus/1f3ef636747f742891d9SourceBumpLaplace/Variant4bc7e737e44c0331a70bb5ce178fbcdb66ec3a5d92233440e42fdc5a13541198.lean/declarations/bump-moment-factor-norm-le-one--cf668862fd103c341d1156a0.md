## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b896f119-f695-56b2-8653-e96aeafe81d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 93–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  have hp : 0 ≤ 1 - x ^ 2 := by linarith
  have hp1 : 1 - x ^ 2 ≤ 1 := by nlinarith [sq_nonneg x]
  simp only [norm_mul, norm_pow, Complex.norm_real, Real.norm_eq_abs,
    abs_of_nonneg hp]
  exact mul_le_one₀ (pow_le_one₀ (abs_nonneg x) ha) (pow_nonneg hp 4)
    (pow_le_one₀ hp hp1)

/-- Actual complex parameter differentiation is justified by a compact local majorant. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/1f3ef636747f742891d9SourceBumpLaplace/Variant4bc7e737e44c0331a70bb5ce178fbcdb66ec3a5d92233440e42fdc5a13541198.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/1f3ef636747f742891d9SourceBumpLaplace/Variant4bc7e737e44c0331a70bb5ce178fbcdb66ec3a5d92233440e42fdc5a13541198.lean#L93).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b68ce8b2791c958889ebad8f34616976f3abbf8b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
