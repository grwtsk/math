## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f4a2ac35312daf394d14a67ea415b6aa1023d9b65fd417adc6c1ca303c5303bf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 249–252.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def radialBumpEnergy (z : ℂ) : ℝ :=
  ∫ r in (0 : ℝ)..1, r ^ 10 * Complex.normSq (radialBumpSlope z r)

/-- The mass defining product is genuinely continuous and interval integrable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/1f3ef636747f742891d9SourceBumpLaplace/Variant1f3ef636747f742891d9dc7e5876cada0a5ce2e11055f148d572fd8f7ca99aef.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/1f3ef636747f742891d9SourceBumpLaplace/Variant1f3ef636747f742891d9dc7e5876cada0a5ce2e11055f148d572fd8f7ca99aef.lean#L249).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `61c180fdcb90a95cf292c5bb5ac4e81c082c5127` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
