## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:04a61f6a-e0af-ee57-cb44-f8aee50259e0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–74.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sourceCorrelation_eq_normalizedOverlap_filter {A t : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A)
    (ht0 : 0 ≤ t) (ht2 : t ≤ 2 * A) :
    sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A t =
      deriv (deriv (deriv (deriv (normalizedOverlapProfile A)))) t -
        deriv (deriv (normalizedOverlapProfile A)) t / 2 +
        normalizedOverlapProfile A t / 16 := by

    primitiveCorrelationZero_fourth_deriv_eq_normalizedOverlapProfile hA ⟨ht0, ht2⟩,

    ← primitiveCorrelationZero_second_deriv_eq_neg_one hA,
    primitiveCorrelationZero_second_deriv_eq_normalizedOverlapProfile hA ⟨ht0, ht2⟩,

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Attempt06/Variantcf568e88d2994f22aa43cd6473e313eb223ee855af34b83f704e46a2555a60f7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Attempt06/Variantcf568e88d2994f22aa43cd6473e313eb223ee855af34b83f704e46a2555a60f7.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c2860e57596cf20f82223e46e2b01030027caa31` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
