## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2086ccce-fdef-ea12-edcf-5013087aaa4f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem centeredTwistedPsiStep_natCast
    {q : ℕ} (χ : DirichletCharacter ℂ q) (x : ℕ) :
    centeredTwistedPsiStep χ x = centeredTwistedPsi χ x := by
  by_cases hx : x = 0
  · simp [hx, centeredTwistedPsiStep, centeredTwistedPsi]
  · have hx1 : (1 : ℝ) ≤ (x : ℝ) := by
      exact_mod_cast (Nat.one_le_iff_ne_zero.mpr hx)
    simp [centeredTwistedPsiStep, centeredTwistedPsi, hx1]

/-- Above `1`, the continuously centered interpolation differs from the
discrete centered sum at `floor t` by only the bounded floor error.  This
identity is the key point in the principal-character channel: estimating
the twisted sum and the linear main term separately would lose the
square-root scale. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MellinLogDerivative/Variantfb4c4ae4d7dbb0ab4698a5228ddf930189d0203e93c3901616d773a3a6f5ee3f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/MellinLogDerivative/Variantfb4c4ae4d7dbb0ab4698a5228ddf930189d0203e93c3901616d773a3a6f5ee3f.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e502a9084252a158def2399fc084d6ac35834148` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
