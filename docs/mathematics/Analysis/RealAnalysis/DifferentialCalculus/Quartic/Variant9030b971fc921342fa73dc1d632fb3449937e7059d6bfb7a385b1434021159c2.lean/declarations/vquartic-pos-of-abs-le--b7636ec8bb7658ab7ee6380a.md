## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e0e2a2ba-e5ef-45dc-0e01-5f0a21dd4403`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 38–47.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma vQuartic_pos_of_abs_le {s : ℝ} (hs : |s| ≤ 3 / 5) : 0 < vQuartic s := by
  rw [vQuartic_eq]
  have h2 : s ^ 2 ≤ 9 / 25 := by
    have := abs_le.mp hs; nlinarith
  have h4 : s ^ 4 ≤ 81 / 625 := by
    have : s ^ 4 = (s ^ 2) ^ 2 := by ring
    rw [this]; nlinarith [sq_nonneg s]
  nlinarith

/-- vQuartic is nonincreasing in |s| on [0, ∞). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Quartic/Variant9030b971fc921342fa73dc1d632fb3449937e7059d6bfb7a385b1434021159c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Quartic/Variant9030b971fc921342fa73dc1d632fb3449937e7059d6bfb7a385b1434021159c2.lean#L38).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4af68999694eed7a92ae7ce5929aa3a6582582b6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
