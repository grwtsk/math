## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1a65dee8-6994-bae7-60fa-90034e2788e9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 46–54.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actual_derivative_energy_upper_five {A : ℝ} (hA : 200 ≤ A) :
    A ^ 2 * (∫ x : ℝ, (deriv (normalizedTest explicitSecondDerivative A) x) ^ 2) ≤ 5 := by
  have hp : 0 < A := by linarith
  rw [actual_derivative_energy_eq hp]
  apply exact_ratio_upper_five (by positivity)
  have hsq : (40000 : ℝ) ≤ A ^ 2 := by nlinarith
  simpa only [one_div] using one_div_le_one_div_of_le (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) < 40000) hsq

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/7d693de4554d8c2c9e15e12ca0d27c8437a4fd708ac3e6d1bbe1f32b3a77e422SourceCorrelatio/Variant79b9ab99960dae842cb7a216d82e2b57fed261e5171a00e5137cce8c5de3947f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/7d693de4554d8c2c9e15e12ca0d27c8437a4fd708ac3e6d1bbe1f32b3a77e422SourceCorrelatio/Variant79b9ab99960dae842cb7a216d82e2b57fed261e5171a00e5137cce8c5de3947f.lean#L46).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `133b51d63486d6c2de84035ebf1007541010140b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
