## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:843aea2bc0149f41f617d8fd3d0c151cc9c9d48ac37721cf87898f186c892410`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 254–258.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def jacobiTheta₂_fderiv (z τ : ℂ) : ℂ × ℂ →L[ℂ] ℂ := ∑' n : ℤ, jacobiTheta₂_term_fderiv n z τ

/-- The `z`-derivative of the Jacobi theta function,
`θ' z τ = ∑' (n : ℤ), 2 * π * I * n * cexp (2 * π * I * n * z + π * I * n ^ 2 * τ)`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/TwoVariable/Variante22d77f5fc1b4e2fc58c6509d12e9bc5aa467c3943c0563161d274aa35d109fe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/TwoVariable/Variante22d77f5fc1b4e2fc58c6509d12e9bc5aa467c3943c0563161d274aa35d109fe.lean#L254).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cd77f9b89bf0f397ea397436abf6b5f605eeb5ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
