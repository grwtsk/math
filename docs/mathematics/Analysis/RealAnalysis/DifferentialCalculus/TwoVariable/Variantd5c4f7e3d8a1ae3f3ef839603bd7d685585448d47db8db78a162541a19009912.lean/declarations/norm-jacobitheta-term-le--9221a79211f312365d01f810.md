## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:06852ee5-acd0-e37e-519f-304812f67d54`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–110.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma norm_jacobiTheta₂'_term_le {S T : ℝ} (hT : 0 < T) {z τ : ℂ}
    (hz : |im z| ≤ S) (hτ : T ≤ im τ) (n : ℤ) :
    ‖jacobiTheta₂'_term n z τ‖ ≤ 2 * π * |n| * rexp (-π * (T * n ^ 2 - 2 * S * |n|)) := by
  rw [jacobiTheta₂'_term, norm_mul]
  refine mul_le_mul (le_of_eq ?_) (norm_jacobiTheta₂_term_le hT hz hτ n)
    (norm_nonneg _) (by positivity)
  simp only [norm_mul, Complex.norm_two, norm_I, Complex.norm_of_nonneg pi_pos.le,
    norm_intCast, mul_one, Int.cast_abs]

/-- The uniform bound we have given is summable, and remains so after multiplying by any fixed
power of `|n|` (we shall need this for `k = 0, 1, 2`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/TwoVariable/Variantd5c4f7e3d8a1ae3f3ef839603bd7d685585448d47db8db78a162541a19009912.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/TwoVariable/Variantd5c4f7e3d8a1ae3f3ef839603bd7d685585448d47db8db78a162541a19009912.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fff7edb82ee71ebadce8dce2f842269bc7169126` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
