## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:73bf7c57639145496c9c25fafcad7cc095277e81a1661c3773657c8d6fde2641`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 66–78.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def jacobiTheta₂'_term (n : ℤ) (z τ : ℂ) := 2 * π * I * n * jacobiTheta₂_term n z τ

end term_defs

section term_bounds
/-!
## Bounds for the summands

We show that the sums of the three functions `jacobiTheta₂_term`, `jacobiTheta₂'_term` and
`jacobiTheta₂_term_fderiv` are locally uniformly convergent in the domain `0 < im τ`, and diverge
everywhere else.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/TwoVariable/Variantd5c4f7e3d8a1ae3f3ef839603bd7d685585448d47db8db78a162541a19009912.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/TwoVariable/Variantd5c4f7e3d8a1ae3f3ef839603bd7d685585448d47db8db78a162541a19009912.lean#L66).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fff7edb82ee71ebadce8dce2f842269bc7169126` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
