## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c59ca4a-d280-0e65-cde5-21b734946f5e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 438–463.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- **Taylor's theorem** with the Integral form of the remainder. This is an auxiliary theorem
which is used to prove the two useful versions `taylor_integral_remainder_of_absolutelyContinuous`
and `taylor_integral_remainder`.

We assume that for any `k ≤ n`, the following equation on integration by parts hold:
$$\int_{x_0}^x \frac{f^{(k+1)}(t) (x - t)^k}{k!} =
\frac{f^{(k)}(t) (x - t)^k}{k!} |_{x_0}^x -\int_{x_0}^x \frac{f^{(k)}(t) (x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}.$$
Then
$$f(x) - (P_n f)(x₀, x) = \int_{x_0}^x \frac{f^{(n+1)}(t) (x - t)^n}{n!} dt,$$
where $P_n f$ denotes the Taylor polynomial of degree $n$ and $f^{(n+1)}$ is the $n+1$-th iterated
derivative. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Variantce7c05e14bf3d45f3545060bbf2438d301d082aad351f47f132aab2c51276710.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Variantce7c05e14bf3d45f3545060bbf2438d301d082aad351f47f132aab2c51276710.lean#L438).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9dea21478fb0d66940ebb3a1d39bda7fd0f07ffc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
