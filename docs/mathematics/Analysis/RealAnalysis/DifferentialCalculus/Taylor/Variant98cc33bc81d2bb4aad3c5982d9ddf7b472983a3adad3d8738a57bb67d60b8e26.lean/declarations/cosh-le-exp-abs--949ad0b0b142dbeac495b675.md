## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7b6b7ab5-58bf-b814-d58c-8be0526e8034`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 820–827.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cosh_le_exp_abs (x : ℝ) : Real.cosh x ≤ Real.exp |x| := by
  rw [Real.cosh_eq]
  have h1 : Real.exp x ≤ Real.exp |x| := Real.exp_le_exp.mpr (le_abs_self x)
  have habs_neg : -x ≤ |x| := neg_le_abs x
  have h2 : Real.exp (-x) ≤ Real.exp |x| := Real.exp_le_exp.mpr habs_neg
  linarith

/-- |sinh x| ≤ cosh x for all x -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Variant98cc33bc81d2bb4aad3c5982d9ddf7b472983a3adad3d8738a57bb67d60b8e26.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Variant98cc33bc81d2bb4aad3c5982d9ddf7b472983a3adad3d8738a57bb67d60b8e26.lean#L820).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `daa674e10401043ad9a6d9d86250f10900fcc053` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
