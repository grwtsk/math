## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f7e19410b4ff507625aced77106bf860caf2cba037b52b49131c8292e6446f40`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 165–180.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def expRemainderBoundComputable (I : IntervalRat) (n : ℕ) : IntervalRat :=
  let r := maxAbs I
  -- Crude bound: e < 3, so e^r ≤ 3^(ceil(r)+1)
  let expBound := (3 : ℚ) ^ (Nat.ceil r + 1)
  let xBound := r ^ (n + 1)
  let R := expBound * xBound / ratFactorial (n + 1)
  ⟨-R, R, by
    have hr : 0 ≤ r := le_max_of_le_left (abs_nonneg I.lo)
    have hR : 0 ≤ R := by
      apply div_nonneg
      · apply mul_nonneg
        · apply pow_nonneg; norm_num
        · apply pow_nonneg hr
      · exact Nat.cast_nonneg _
    linarith⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Variant9f5d55776c9b353656498a97b0569cac6621456c550427c8ca5d5a57da8db252.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Variant9f5d55776c9b353656498a97b0569cac6621456c550427c8ca5d5a57da8db252.lean#L165).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a6c6829e8730fc564ee9c4c8215bb55539bae25a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
