## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9ab4a6ce83ec0f18843b10faba72c48ec58ba422f1e381e9a07f88329d69ce5c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1885–1902.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def erfTaylorCoeffs (n : ℕ) : List ℚ :=
  (List.range (n + 1)).map (fun i =>
    if i % 2 = 1 then  -- odd terms only: x, x³, x⁵, ...
      let m : ℕ := (i - 1) / 2  -- for x^(2m+1), m = (i-1)/2
      ((-1 : ℚ) ^ m) / (ratFactorial m * (i : ℚ))
    else 0)

/-- Computable erf remainder bound.
    Since |erf^{(k)}(x)| ≤ (2/√π) * 2^k for all x (rough bound),
    and erf is bounded by 1, we use a combination.

    For the Taylor remainder centered at 0, we use:
    |R_n(x)| ≤ sup|f^{(n+1)}(ξ)| * |x|^{n+1} / (n+1)!

    A conservative bound: |erf^{(k)}(x)| ≤ (2/√π) * k! / (k/2)! ≤ 2 * k^{k/2}
    But since |erf| ≤ 1, we can intersect with [-1, 1].

    We use: remainder ≤ 2 * |x|^{n+1} / (n+1)! (very conservative). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Variant9f5d55776c9b353656498a97b0569cac6621456c550427c8ca5d5a57da8db252.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Variant9f5d55776c9b353656498a97b0569cac6621456c550427c8ca5d5a57da8db252.lean#L1885).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a6c6829e8730fc564ee9c4c8215bb55539bae25a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
