## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0bfd2dfb1da8145347931db672e53ce49dc3799e951d3eda4aa87a164604ebd4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 345–362.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def coshPointComputable (q : ℚ) (n : ℕ := 10) : IntervalRat :=
  let expPos := expPointComputable q n
  let expNeg := expPointComputable (-q) n
  -- cosh(q) = (exp(q) + exp(-q)) / 2
  -- Lower bound: (expPos.lo + expNeg.lo) / 2
  -- Upper bound: (expPos.hi + expNeg.hi) / 2
  let coshLo := (expPos.lo + expNeg.lo) / 2
  let coshHi := (expPos.hi + expNeg.hi) / 2
  -- cosh ≥ 1 always, so ensure lower bound is at least 1
  let safeLo := max 1 coshLo
  if h : safeLo ≤ coshHi then
    ⟨safeLo, coshHi, h⟩
  else
    ⟨1, max 2 coshHi, by
      have h1 : (1 : ℚ) ≤ 2 := by norm_num
      exact le_trans h1 (le_max_left _ _)⟩

/-- The lower bound of coshPointComputable is always at least 1. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Varianta3087abea809e169bf2918a5e5b333746ff6e6d81dbc51c342a110a7e5a9f021.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Varianta3087abea809e169bf2918a5e5b333746ff6e6d81dbc51c342a110a7e5a9f021.lean#L345).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a5d77910a9e93a11e86c3302ea1599c8aaba4194` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
