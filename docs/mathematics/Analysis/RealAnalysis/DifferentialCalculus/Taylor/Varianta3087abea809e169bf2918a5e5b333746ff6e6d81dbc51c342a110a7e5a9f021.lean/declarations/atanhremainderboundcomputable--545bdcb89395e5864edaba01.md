## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d88a7b0dff6f2662457b1d8ab86badaca2bb79b6e875e8d69ca6b4afb77d80e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1339–1356.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def atanhRemainderBoundComputable (r : ℚ) (n : ℕ) : IntervalRat :=
  let r' := |r|  -- Use absolute value to ensure non-negativity
  if h : r' ≥ 1 then
    ⟨-1000, 1000, by norm_num⟩  -- Fallback for bad input
  else
    let R := r' ^ (n + 1) / (1 - r')
    ⟨-R, R, by
      have hr : r' < 1 := not_le.mp h
      have hr_nonneg : 0 ≤ r' := abs_nonneg r
      have hdenom_pos : 0 < 1 - r' := by linarith
      have hR_nonneg : 0 ≤ R := by
        apply div_nonneg
        · apply pow_nonneg hr_nonneg
        · linarith
      linarith⟩

/-- Computable interval enclosure for atanh at a single rational point.
    Requires |q| < 1 for convergence. For |q| ≤ 1/3, this is very accurate. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Varianta3087abea809e169bf2918a5e5b333746ff6e6d81dbc51c342a110a7e5a9f021.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Varianta3087abea809e169bf2918a5e5b333746ff6e6d81dbc51c342a110a7e5a9f021.lean#L1339).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a5d77910a9e93a11e86c3302ea1599c8aaba4194` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
