## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5aebdbbd-4040-045e-f047-feeeec351da8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 298–325.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- **Taylor's theorem** with the Lagrange form of the remainder.

We assume that `f` is `n+1`-times continuously differentiable in the closed set `Icc x₀ x` and
`n+1`-times differentiable on the open set `Ioo x₀ x`. Then there exists an `x' ∈ Ioo x₀ x` such
that $$f(x) - (P_n f)(x₀, x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(x') (x - x₀)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!},$$
where $P_n f$ denotes the Taylor polynomial of degree $n$ and $f^{(n+1)}$ is the $n+1$-th iterated
derivative. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Variant32bb58acf5ce81ed2a4da017ac3b3f88d1bd8d02a282f16374bc2597d06bbfcc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/DifferentialCalculus/Taylor/Variant32bb58acf5ce81ed2a4da017ac3b3f88d1bd8d02a282f16374bc2597d06bbfcc.lean#L298).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0f3fda733c56ec3b5b896cef4062ede4082eafa2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
