## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bfb44eabbfa19f033ea0bac41f70dc556d6541af9fa468506c51550daf9fbed5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 90–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def RasterRounding.roundSigned (mode : RasterRounding) (input : ℚ) : SignedInteger :=
  let result := mode.round input
  if zero : result = 0 then
    if negative : input < 0 ∧ mode ≠ .floor then
      { value := result
        negativeZero := true
        negativeZeroOnlyAtZero := fun _ => zero }
    else
      { value := result
        negativeZero := false
        negativeZeroOnlyAtZero := by simp }
  else
    { value := result
      negativeZero := false
      negativeZeroOnlyAtZero := by simp }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/RealAnalysis/RealFunctions/ExactRationalRounding/Variant03d73452c99c6fd3/SignedRoundingAndNormalization.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/RealAnalysis/RealFunctions/ExactRationalRounding/Variant03d73452c99c6fd3/SignedRoundingAndNormalization.lean#L90).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `201ec1edefe87aef531ed47a39063015aeb278ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
