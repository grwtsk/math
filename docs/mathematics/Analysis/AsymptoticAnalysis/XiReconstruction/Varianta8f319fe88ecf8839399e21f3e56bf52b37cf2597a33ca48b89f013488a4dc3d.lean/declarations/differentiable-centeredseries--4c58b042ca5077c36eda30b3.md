## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1b49aeb8-960f-ce2a-e2ca-5a66395f5d67`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 93–102.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem differentiable_centeredSeries : Differentiable ℂ centeredSeries := by
  let p := FormalMultilinearSeries.ofScalars ℂ (fun n => (coefficient n : ℂ))
  have heq : p.sum = centeredSeries := by
    funext w
    exact FormalMultilinearSeries.ofScalars_sum_eq _ w
  have ha := (FormalMultilinearSeries.analyticOnNhd (p := p))
  rw [show p.radius = ⊤ from centeredSeries_radius, Metric.eball_top, heq] at ha
  exact differentiableOn_univ.mp ha.differentiableOn

/-- Unconditional proof of the unchanged, previously open Taylor-descent target. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/XiReconstruction/Varianta8f319fe88ecf8839399e21f3e56bf52b37cf2597a33ca48b89f013488a4dc3d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/XiReconstruction/Varianta8f319fe88ecf8839399e21f3e56bf52b37cf2597a33ca48b89f013488a4dc3d.lean#L93).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a2a5a6b645892e9eb25c19137cf8f72530fdb9e1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
