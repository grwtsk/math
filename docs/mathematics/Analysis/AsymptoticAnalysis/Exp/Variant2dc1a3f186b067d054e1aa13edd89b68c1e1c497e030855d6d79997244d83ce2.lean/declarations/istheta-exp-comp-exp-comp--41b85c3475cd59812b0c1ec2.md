## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ad0ae490-1715-91a1-fd9c-56042f3911e9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 395–401.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isTheta_exp_comp_exp_comp {f g : α → ℝ} :
    ((fun x => exp (f x)) =Θ[l] fun x => exp (g x)) ↔
      IsBoundedUnder (· ≤ ·) l fun x => |f x - g x| := by
  simp only [isBoundedUnder_le_abs, ← isBoundedUnder_le_neg, neg_sub, IsTheta,
    isBigO_exp_comp_exp_comp, Pi.sub_def]

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Exp/Variant2dc1a3f186b067d054e1aa13edd89b68c1e1c497e030855d6d79997244d83ce2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Exp/Variant2dc1a3f186b067d054e1aa13edd89b68c1e1c497e030855d6d79997244d83ce2.lean#L395).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6292e48b94f7cf07b3bfcfcf263bcadc31717e5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
