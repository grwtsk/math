## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0768d1ca-c48c-8742-c122-b030dc8aa5ae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 206–212.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rothNumberNat_isLittleO_id :
    IsLittleO atTop (fun N ↦ (rothNumberNat N : ℝ)) (fun N ↦ (N : ℝ)) := by
  simp only [isLittleO_iff, eventually_atTop, RCLike.norm_natCast]
  refine fun ε hε ↦ ⟨cornersTheoremBound (ε / 3), fun n hn ↦ ?_⟩
  obtain ⟨A, hs₁, hs₂, hs₃⟩ := rothNumberNat_spec n
  rw [← hs₂, ← not_lt]
  exact fun hδn ↦ roth_3ap_theorem_nat ε hε hn _ hs₁ hδn.le hs₃
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Roth/Variantfcac35f34cb37042d5cde9ec4d9afd5954e12bb7cdb2e52aac96ac1a4cd6edf8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Roth/Variantfcac35f34cb37042d5cde9ec4d9afd5954e12bb7cdb2e52aac96ac1a4cd6edf8.lean#L206).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `61b864640791ebb4661a1330ddc564dbb0df1380` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
