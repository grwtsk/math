## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:250cab8a-2740-5ea0-9b65-975b2bb23b11`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–105.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem D1coeff_tail_le (j : ℕ) : D1coeff (9 + j) ≤ D1coeff 9 * (20 / 231) ^ j := by
  induction j with
  | zero => simp
  | succ j ih =>
    have h := D1coeff_succ_le (9 + j) (by omega)
    have : 9 + (j + 1) = 9 + j + 1 := by ring
    rw [this]
    calc D1coeff (9 + j + 1) ≤ D1coeff (9 + j) * (20 / 231) := h
      _ ≤ D1coeff 9 * (20 / 231) ^ j * (20 / 231) :=
          mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right ih (by norm_num)
      _ = D1coeff 9 * (20 / 231) ^ (j + 1) := by ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/D1/Variant8e869e94bed5ea85e00a59caf0ff76d19dc9c42cd19eba0bbf35e87ea709b3a2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/D1/Variant8e869e94bed5ea85e00a59caf0ff76d19dc9c42cd19eba0bbf35e87ea709b3a2.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `036f84b7cb8355e2f941db818033eff3ba55d236` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
