## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aca3d54b-2076-b24f-f785-eee3e4f3ca65`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 880–899.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem compAlongOrderedFinpartition_apply {n : ℕ} (q : FormalMultilinearSeries 𝕜 F G)
    (p : FormalMultilinearSeries 𝕜 E F) (c : OrderedFinpartition n) (v : Fin n → E) :
    (q.compAlongOrderedFinpartition p c) v =
      q c.length (c.applyOrderedFinpartition (fun m ↦ (p (c.partSize m))) v) :=
  rfl

/-- Taylor formal composition of two formal multilinear series. The `n`-th coefficient in the
composition is defined to be the sum of `q.compAlongOrderedFinpartition p c` over all
ordered partitions of `n`.
In other words, this term (as a multilinear function applied to `v₀, ..., vₙ₋₁`) is
`∑'_{k} ∑'_{I₀ ⊔ ... ⊔ Iₖ₋₁ = {0, ..., n-1}} qₖ (p_{i₀} (...), ..., p_{iₖ₋₁} (...))`, where
`iₘ` is the size of `Iₘ` and one puts all variables of `Iₘ` as arguments to `p_{iₘ}`, in
increasing order. The sets `I₀, ..., Iₖ₋₁` are ordered so that `max I₀ < max I₁ < ... < max Iₖ₋₁`.

This definition is chosen so that the `n`-th derivative of `g ∘ f` is the Taylor composition of
the iterated derivatives of `g` and of `f`.

Not to be confused with another notion of composition for formal multilinear series, called just
`FormalMultilinearSeries.comp`, appearing in the composition of analytic functions.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/FaaDiBruno/Variant79b3216e965f032554197e51cb6d4dbcfb35e8a801b3dde1228f0eacbbb64aaf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/FaaDiBruno/Variant79b3216e965f032554197e51cb6d4dbcfb35e8a801b3dde1228f0eacbbb64aaf.lean#L880).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `633c4dec60f69dbd0b32039b833bf205dd58a07f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
