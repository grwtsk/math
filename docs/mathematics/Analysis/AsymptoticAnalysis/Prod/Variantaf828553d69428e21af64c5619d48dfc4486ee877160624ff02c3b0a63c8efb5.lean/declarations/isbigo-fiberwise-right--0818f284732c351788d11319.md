## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:533fe1be-3d80-8c2d-4453-743ee649df44`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 95–100.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem IsBigO.fiberwise_right :
    f =O[l ×ˢ l'] g → ∀ᶠ a in l, (f ⟨a, ·⟩) =O[l'] (g ⟨a, ·⟩) := by
  simp only [isBigO_iff, eventually_iff, mem_prod_iff]
  rintro ⟨c, t₁, ht₁, t₂, ht₂, ht⟩
  exact mem_of_superset ht₁ fun _ ha ↦ ⟨c, mem_of_superset ht₂ fun _ hb ↦ ht ⟨ha, hb⟩⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Prod/Variantaf828553d69428e21af64c5619d48dfc4486ee877160624ff02c3b0a63c8efb5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Prod/Variantaf828553d69428e21af64c5619d48dfc4486ee877160624ff02c3b0a63c8efb5.lean#L95).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dbcb35a55187e05fd2a2f7490743b244218434bc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
