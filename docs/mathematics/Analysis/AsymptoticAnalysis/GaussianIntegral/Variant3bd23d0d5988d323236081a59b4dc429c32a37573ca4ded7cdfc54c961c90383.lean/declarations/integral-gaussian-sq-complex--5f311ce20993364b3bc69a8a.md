## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:54990ff2-d65d-f32f-18fa-40ac90bb0b5f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 198–228.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  /- We compute `(∫ exp (-b x^2))^2` as an integral over `ℝ^2`, and then make a polar change
  of coordinates. We are left with `∫ r * exp (-b r^2)`, which has been computed in
  `integral_mul_cexp_neg_mul_sq` using the fact that this function has an obvious primitive. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/GaussianIntegral/Variant3bd23d0d5988d323236081a59b4dc429c32a37573ca4ded7cdfc54c961c90383.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/GaussianIntegral/Variant3bd23d0d5988d323236081a59b4dc429c32a37573ca4ded7cdfc54c961c90383.lean#L198).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
