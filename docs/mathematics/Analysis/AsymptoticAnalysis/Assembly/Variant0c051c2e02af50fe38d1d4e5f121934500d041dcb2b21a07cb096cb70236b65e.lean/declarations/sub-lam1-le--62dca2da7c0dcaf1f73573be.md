## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ce1ba783-521d-4ead-ed5b-d104dcc568d3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 255–265.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma sub_lam1_le (P : Params) (T : ℝ) (hlam : 0 ≤ P.lam) (hl : 0 < l T) :
    P.lam - P.lam1 T ≤ P.lam / l T := by
  rw [lam1_eq]
  have hc := c₀_pos; have hc1 := c₀_lt_one
  have h1 : P.lam - P.lam * l T / (l T + c₀) = P.lam * c₀ / (l T + c₀) := by
    field_simp; ring
  rw [h1, div_le_div_iff₀ (by linarith) hl]
  have h2 : c₀ * l T ≤ l T + c₀ := by nlinarith
  calc P.lam * c₀ * l T = P.lam * (c₀ * l T) := by ring
    _ ≤ P.lam * (l T + c₀) := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left h2 hlam

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Assembly/Variant0c051c2e02af50fe38d1d4e5f121934500d041dcb2b21a07cb096cb70236b65e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Assembly/Variant0c051c2e02af50fe38d1d4e5f121934500d041dcb2b21a07cb096cb70236b65e.lean#L255).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3469a865bcf135c2b08ee407b8cc36179ab7deac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
