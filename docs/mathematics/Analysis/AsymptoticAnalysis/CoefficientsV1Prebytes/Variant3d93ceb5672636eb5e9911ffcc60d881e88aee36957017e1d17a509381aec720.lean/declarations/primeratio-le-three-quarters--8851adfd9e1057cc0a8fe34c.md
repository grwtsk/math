## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a260edf7-67bc-bab7-4fe0-40a62668063c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem primeRatio_le_three_quarters (p : Nat.Primes) : primeRatio p ≤ 3 / 4 := by
  have hp0 : 0 < ((p : ℕ) : ℝ) := by exact_mod_cast p.property.pos
  have hp2 : (2 : ℝ) ≤ (p : ℕ) := by exact_mod_cast p.property.two_le
  have h0 := primeRatio_nonneg p
  have he : primeRatio p ^ 2 = (((p : ℕ) : ℝ))⁻¹ := by
    unfold primeRatio

    rw [show (-(1 : ℝ) / 2) * (2 : ℕ) = (-1 : ℝ) by norm_num,
      Real.rpow_neg_one]
  have hi : (((p : ℕ) : ℝ))⁻¹ ≤ 1 / 2 := by

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/CoefficientsV1Prebytes/Variant3d93ceb5672636eb5e9911ffcc60d881e88aee36957017e1d17a509381aec720.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/CoefficientsV1Prebytes/Variant3d93ceb5672636eb5e9911ffcc60d881e88aee36957017e1d17a509381aec720.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b1d0db60cee1cde860963917818e06d8b5d6bd9b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
