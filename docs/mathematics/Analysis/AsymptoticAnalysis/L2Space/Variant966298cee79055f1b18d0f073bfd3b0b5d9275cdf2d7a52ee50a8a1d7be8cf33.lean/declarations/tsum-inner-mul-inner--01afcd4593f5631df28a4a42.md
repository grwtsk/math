## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:66a3a795-1d33-5633-3834-199129bbfcbf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 472–478.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem tsum_inner_mul_inner (b : HilbertBasis ι 𝕜 E) (x y : E) :
    ∑' i, ⟪x, b i⟫ * ⟪b i, y⟫ = ⟪x, y⟫ :=
  (b.hasSum_inner_mul_inner x y).tsum_eq

-- Note: this should be `b.repr` composed with an identification of `lp (fun i : ι => 𝕜) p` with
-- `PiLp p (fun i : ι => 𝕜)` (in this case with `p = 2`), but we don't have this yet (July 2022).
/-- A finite Hilbert basis is an orthonormal basis. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/L2Space/Variant966298cee79055f1b18d0f073bfd3b0b5d9275cdf2d7a52ee50a8a1d7be8cf33.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/L2Space/Variant966298cee79055f1b18d0f073bfd3b0b5d9275cdf2d7a52ee50a8a1d7be8cf33.lean#L472).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b8520356ab2f1c4a3fbd850e62a522fc8517f0bf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
