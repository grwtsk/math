## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cf27ae77-0a6f-ea03-b8bb-f8a9ca060966`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 85–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma eventually_atTop_ge {b : ℝ} (hb : b ∈ Set.Ioo 0 1) (hf : GrowsPolynomially f) :
    ∃ c > 0, ∀ᶠ x in atTop, ∀ u ∈ Set.Icc (b * x) x, c * f x ≤ f u := by
  obtain ⟨c₁, hc₁, c₂, _, h⟩ := hf b hb
  refine ⟨c₁, hc₁, ?_⟩
  filter_upwards [h]
  exact fun _ H u hu => (H u hu).1

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/GrowsPolynomially/Variant9ea1f062a7c188b8ca5aef1df024b9bef0c7417353b621ce19caf6c637b367bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/GrowsPolynomially/Variant9ea1f062a7c188b8ca5aef1df024b9bef0c7417353b621ce19caf6c637b367bd.lean#L85).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ebc4480187c09e3283587c150206252ceb767a7a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
