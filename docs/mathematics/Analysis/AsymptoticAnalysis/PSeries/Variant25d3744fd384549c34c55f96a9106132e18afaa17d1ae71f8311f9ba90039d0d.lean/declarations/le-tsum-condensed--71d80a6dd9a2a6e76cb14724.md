## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4d77b53c-6cee-10f6-a551-643284ecbc7d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem le_tsum_condensed (hf : ∀ ⦃m n⦄, 0 < m → m ≤ n → f n ≤ f m) :
    ∑' k, f k ≤ f 0 + ∑' k : ℕ, 2 ^ k * f (2 ^ k) := by
  rw [ENNReal.tsum_eq_iSup_nat' (Nat.tendsto_pow_atTop_atTop_of_one_lt _root_.one_lt_two)]
  refine' iSup_le fun n => (Finset.le_sum_condensed hf n).trans (add_le_add_left _ _)
  simp only [nsmul_eq_mul, Nat.cast_pow, Nat.cast_two]
  apply ENNReal.sum_le_tsum
#align ennreal.le_tsum_condensed ENNReal.le_tsum_condensed

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/PSeries/Variant25d3744fd384549c34c55f96a9106132e18afaa17d1ae71f8311f9ba90039d0d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/PSeries/Variant25d3744fd384549c34c55f96a9106132e18afaa17d1ae71f8311f9ba90039d0d.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d5eeae7a0f8be1a888dbb4f710db6cec92c01536` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
