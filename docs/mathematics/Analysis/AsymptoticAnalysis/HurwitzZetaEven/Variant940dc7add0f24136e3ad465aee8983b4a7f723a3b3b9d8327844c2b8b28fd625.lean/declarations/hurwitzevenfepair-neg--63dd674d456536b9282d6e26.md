## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f9652470-615b-0d20-d73c-d14483e6201f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 295–306.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma hurwitzEvenFEPair_neg (a : UnitAddCircle) : hurwitzEvenFEPair (-a) = hurwitzEvenFEPair a := by
  unfold hurwitzEvenFEPair
  congr 1 <;> simp [Function.comp_def]

/-!
## Definition of the completed even Hurwitz zeta function
-/

/--
The meromorphic function of `s` which agrees with
`1 / 2 * Gamma (s / 2) * π ^ (-s / 2) * ∑' (n : ℤ), 1 / |n + a| ^ s` for `1 < re s`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/HurwitzZetaEven/Variant940dc7add0f24136e3ad465aee8983b4a7f723a3b3b9d8327844c2b8b28fd625.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/HurwitzZetaEven/Variant940dc7add0f24136e3ad465aee8983b4a7f723a3b3b9d8327844c2b8b28fd625.lean#L295).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `013f2bdf9dd03263486c1491a907da39bbde1132` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
