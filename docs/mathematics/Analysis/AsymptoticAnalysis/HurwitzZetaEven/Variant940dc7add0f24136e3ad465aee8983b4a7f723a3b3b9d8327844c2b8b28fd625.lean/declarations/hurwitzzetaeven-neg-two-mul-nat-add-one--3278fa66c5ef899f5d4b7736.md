## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:97a408ca-dd48-4083-6170-0aa3bbe1df8f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 613–622.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hurwitzZetaEven_neg_two_mul_nat_add_one (a : UnitAddCircle) (n : ℕ) :
    hurwitzZetaEven a (-2 * (n + 1)) = 0 := by
  have : (-2 : ℂ) * (n + 1) ≠ 0 :=
    mul_ne_zero (neg_ne_zero.mpr two_ne_zero) (Nat.cast_add_one_ne_zero n)
  rw [hurwitzZetaEven, Function.update_of_ne this, Gammaℝ_eq_zero_iff.mpr ⟨n + 1, by simp⟩,
    div_zero]

/-- The Hurwitz zeta function is differentiable everywhere except at `s = 1`. This is true
even in the delicate case `a = 0` and `s = 0` (where the completed zeta has a pole, but this is
cancelled out by the Gamma factor). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/HurwitzZetaEven/Variant940dc7add0f24136e3ad465aee8983b4a7f723a3b3b9d8327844c2b8b28fd625.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/HurwitzZetaEven/Variant940dc7add0f24136e3ad465aee8983b4a7f723a3b3b9d8327844c2b8b28fd625.lean#L613).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `013f2bdf9dd03263486c1491a907da39bbde1132` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
