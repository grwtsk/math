## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:919e5fd6-044a-e08c-d62f-d8eb02963451`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 546–552.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem AnalyticOn.comp_sub (hf : AnalyticOn 𝕜 f s) (y : E) :
    AnalyticOn 𝕜 (fun z ↦ f (z - y)) (s + {y}) := by
  intro x hx
  simp only [add_singleton, image_add_right, mem_preimage] at hx
  rw [show x = (x - y) + y by abel]
  apply (hf (x - y) (by convert hx using 1; abel)).comp_sub

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Basic/Variant1830a515760f7e205786363317724ce1b6c2c10bd4b1d10dd88a369c64a2b65f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Basic/Variant1830a515760f7e205786363317724ce1b6c2c10bd4b1d10dd88a369c64a2b65f.lean#L546).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `57ccc08fe35d34400d35e11fbe19643732a90dfe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
