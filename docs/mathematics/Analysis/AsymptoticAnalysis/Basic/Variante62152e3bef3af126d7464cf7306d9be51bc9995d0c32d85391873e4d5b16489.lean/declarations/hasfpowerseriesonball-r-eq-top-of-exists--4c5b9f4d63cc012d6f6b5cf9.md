## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:80e370d1-c790-615d-92de-11245b32572e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1049–1102.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Changing origin in a power series

If a function is analytic in a disk `D(x, R)`, then it is analytic in any disk contained in that
one. Indeed, one can write
$$
f (x + y + z) = \sum_{n} p_n (y + z)^n = \sum_{n, k} \binom{n}{k} p_n y^{n-k} z^k
= \sum_{k} \Bigl(\sum_{n} \binom{n}{k} p_n y^{n-k}\Bigr) z^k.
$$
The corresponding power series has thus a `k`-th coefficient equal to
$\sum_{n} \binom{n}{k} p_n y^{n-k}$. In the general case where `pₙ` is a multilinear map, this has
to be interpreted suitably: instead of having a binomial coefficient, one should sum over all
possible subsets `s` of `Fin n` of cardinal `k`, and attribute `z` to the indices in `s` and
`y` to the indices outside of `s`.

In this paragraph, we implement this. The new power series is called `p.changeOrigin y`. Then, we
check its convergence and the fact that its sum coincides with the original sum. The outcome of this
discussion is that the set of points where a function is analytic is open.

variable (p : FormalMultilinearSeries 𝕜 E F) {x y : E} {r R : ℝ≥0}

/-- A term of `FormalMultilinearSeries.changeOriginSeries`.

Given a formal multilinear series `p` and a point `x` in its ball of convergence,
`p.changeOrigin x` is a formal multilinear series such that
`p.sum (x+y) = (p.changeOrigin x).sum y` when this makes sense. Each term of `p.changeOrigin x`
is itself an analytic function of `x` given by the series `p.changeOriginSeries`. Each term in
`changeOriginSeries` is the sum of `changeOriginSeriesTerm`'s over all `s` of cardinality `l`.
The definition is such that `p.changeOriginSeriesTerm k l s hs (fun _ ↦ x) (fun _ ↦ y) =
p (k + l) (s.piecewise (fun _ ↦ x) (fun _ ↦ y))`

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Basic/Variante62152e3bef3af126d7464cf7306d9be51bc9995d0c32d85391873e4d5b16489.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
