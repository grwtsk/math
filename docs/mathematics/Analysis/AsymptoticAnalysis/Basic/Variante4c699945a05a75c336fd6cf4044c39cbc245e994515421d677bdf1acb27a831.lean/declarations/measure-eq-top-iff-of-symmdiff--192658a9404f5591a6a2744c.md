## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:93479a15-7029-8009-ad6b-b84f90e46a86`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 239–252.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measure_eq_top_iff_of_symmDiff (hμst : μ (s ∆ t) ≠ ∞) : μ s = ∞ ↔ μ t = ∞ := by
  suffices h : ∀ u v, μ (u ∆ v) ≠ ∞ → μ u = ∞ → μ v = ∞
    from ⟨h s t hμst, h t s (symmDiff_comm s t ▸ hμst)⟩
  intro u v hμuv hμu
  by_contra! hμv
  apply hμuv
  rw [Set.symmDiff_def, eq_top_iff]
  calc
    ∞ = μ u - μ v := by rw [ENNReal.sub_eq_top_iff.2 ⟨hμu, hμv⟩]
    _ ≤ μ (u \ v) := le_measure_sdiff
    _ ≤ μ (u \ v ∪ v \ u) := measure_mono subset_union_left

/-- If the measure of the symmetric difference of two sets is finite,
then one has finite measure if and only if the other one does. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Basic/Variante4c699945a05a75c336fd6cf4044c39cbc245e994515421d677bdf1acb27a831.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Basic/Variante4c699945a05a75c336fd6cf4044c39cbc245e994515421d677bdf1acb27a831.lean#L239).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1db5b135ef957b4ac5c78b343d167163a8f62bb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
