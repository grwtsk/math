## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:eb78d13b-339c-6730-fec3-78f0380c2475`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 290–297.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measure_eq_measure_smaller_of_between_null_sdiff (h12 : s₁ ⊆ s₂)
    (h23 : s₂ ⊆ s₃) (h_nullsdiff : μ (s₃ \ s₁) = 0) : μ s₁ = μ s₂ :=
  (measure_eq_measure_of_between_null_sdiff h12 h23 h_nullsdiff).1

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Basic/Variante4c699945a05a75c336fd6cf4044c39cbc245e994515421d677bdf1acb27a831.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Basic/Variante4c699945a05a75c336fd6cf4044c39cbc245e994515421d677bdf1acb27a831.lean#L290).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1db5b135ef957b4ac5c78b343d167163a8f62bb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
