## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5459d34c1c6179fc9db7cd2407fdbf372f969010226a8762197ae365969a12c8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 347–360.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toPmf [Countable α] [MeasurableSpace α] [MeasurableSingletonClass α] (μ : Measure α)
    [h : IsProbabilityMeasure μ] : Pmf α :=
  ⟨fun x => μ ({x} : Set α),
    ENNReal.summable.hasSum_iff.2
      (_root_.trans
        (symm <|
          (tsum_indicator_apply_singleton μ Set.univ MeasurableSet.univ).symm.trans
            (tsum_congr fun x => congr_fun (Set.indicator_univ _) x))
        h.measure_univ)⟩
#align measure_theory.measure.to_pmf MeasureTheory.Measure.toPmf

variable [Countable α] [MeasurableSpace α] [MeasurableSingletonClass α] (μ : Measure α)
  [IsProbabilityMeasure μ]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Basic/Variant309aff74b5556cf5cf398a850112170451f87277d5de35edf9579e1afc322adc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Basic/Variant309aff74b5556cf5cf398a850112170451f87277d5de35edf9579e1afc322adc.lean#L347).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `77fdf61b2768d6f60544b113b558f182754633f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
