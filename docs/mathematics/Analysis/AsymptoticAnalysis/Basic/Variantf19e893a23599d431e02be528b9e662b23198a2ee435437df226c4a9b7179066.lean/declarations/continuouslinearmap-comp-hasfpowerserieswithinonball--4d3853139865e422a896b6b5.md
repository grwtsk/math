## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:feab728a-fa60-cf4d-a1ef-54d8a02c71e8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 556–567.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContinuousLinearMap.comp_hasFPowerSeriesWithinOnBall (g : F →L[𝕜] G)
    (h : HasFPowerSeriesWithinOnBall f p s x r) :
    HasFPowerSeriesWithinOnBall (g ∘ f) (g.compFormalMultilinearSeries p) s x r where
  r_le := h.r_le.trans (p.radius_le_radius_continuousLinearMap_comp _)
  r_pos := h.r_pos
  hasSum hy h'y := by
    simpa only [ContinuousLinearMap.compFormalMultilinearSeries_apply,
      ContinuousLinearMap.compContinuousMultilinearMap_coe, Function.comp_apply] using
      g.hasSum (h.hasSum hy h'y)

/-- If a function `f` has a power series `p` on a ball and `g` is linear, then `g ∘ f` has the
power series `g ∘ p` on the same ball. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Basic/Variantf19e893a23599d431e02be528b9e662b23198a2ee435437df226c4a9b7179066.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Basic/Variantf19e893a23599d431e02be528b9e662b23198a2ee435437df226c4a9b7179066.lean#L556).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5c88012ed4bccff4e09c30b984dfafcb75761ca0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
