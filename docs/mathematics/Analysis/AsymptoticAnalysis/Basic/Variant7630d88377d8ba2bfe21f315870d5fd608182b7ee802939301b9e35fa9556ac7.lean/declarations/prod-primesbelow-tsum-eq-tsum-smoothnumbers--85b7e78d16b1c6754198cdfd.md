## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c37976b6-af99-1b59-c073-1e9d4e8f99b7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 155–162.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma prod_primesBelow_tsum_eq_tsum_smoothNumbers (hsum : Summable (‖f ·‖)) (N : ℕ) :
    ∏ p ∈ N.primesBelow, ∑' n : ℕ, f (p ^ n) = ∑' m : N.smoothNumbers, f m :=
  (summable_and_hasSum_smoothNumbers_prod_primesBelow_tsum hf₁ hmul
    (fun hp ↦ hsum.comp_injective <| Nat.pow_right_injective hp.one_lt) _).2.tsum_eq.symm

/-- The following statement says that summing over `N`-smooth numbers
for large enough `N` gets us arbitrarily close to the sum over all natural numbers
(assuming `f` is norm-summable and `f 0 = 0`; the latter since `0` is not smooth). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Basic/Variant7630d88377d8ba2bfe21f315870d5fd608182b7ee802939301b9e35fa9556ac7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Basic/Variant7630d88377d8ba2bfe21f315870d5fd608182b7ee802939301b9e35fa9556ac7.lean#L155).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `88d824da1f06d504490ae01374c29e5d7f6ab473` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
