## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3d70d246-9ab4-9148-9862-cf2ab65a648c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 685–699.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eventually_NII_le (Z : ZeroConfig) {A₀ : ℝ} (hA₀ : 1 ≤ A₀)
    (hloc : ∀ t : ℝ, (Z.N t (t + 1) : ℝ) ≤ A₀ * Real.log (|t| + 3)) :
    ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ᶠ T in atTop, (Assembly.NII Z T : ℝ) ≤ C * Real.sqrt T * l T := by
  refine ⟨6 * A₀, ?_⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Tail/Variant204950604152478e899858b7445220c21700e83b5ad3e38095e5aa7d40fa5485.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Tail/Variant204950604152478e899858b7445220c21700e83b5ad3e38095e5aa7d40fa5485.lean#L685).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2b4f18d0facc79b76677a7ad506b0a698a7fc21b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
