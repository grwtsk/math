## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3bbe12e3-8323-a93e-9858-110d293b4816`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–143.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem HasFPowerSeriesOnBall.exchange_radius {p₁ p₂ : FormalMultilinearSeries 𝕜 𝕜 E} {f : 𝕜 → E}
    {r₁ r₂ : ℝ≥0∞} {x : 𝕜} (h₁ : HasFPowerSeriesOnBall f p₁ x r₁)
    (h₂ : HasFPowerSeriesOnBall f p₂ x r₂) : HasFPowerSeriesOnBall f p₁ x r₂ :=
  h₂.hasFPowerSeriesAt.eq_formalMultilinearSeries h₁.hasFPowerSeriesAt ▸ h₂

/-- If a function `f : 𝕜 → E` has power series representation `p` on a ball of some radius and for
each positive radius it has some power series representation, then `p` converges to `f` on the whole
`𝕜`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Uniqueness/Variantf3ec60c5ad36958191ab38bd7361139dd0b5a653e17803c6a2cea9e01aea325c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Uniqueness/Variantf3ec60c5ad36958191ab38bd7361139dd0b5a653e17803c6a2cea9e01aea325c.lean#L136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c18d6a453947926096f7f08f585699b45e11878c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
