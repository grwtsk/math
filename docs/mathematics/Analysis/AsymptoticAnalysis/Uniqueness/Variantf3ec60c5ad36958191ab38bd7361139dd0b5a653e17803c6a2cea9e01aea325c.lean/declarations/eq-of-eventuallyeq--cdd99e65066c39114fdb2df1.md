## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9ac023c7-e74b-fad2-9f0d-36be9722b12c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 240–245.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_of_eventuallyEq {f g : E → F} [PreconnectedSpace E] (hf : AnalyticOnNhd 𝕜 f univ)
    (hg : AnalyticOnNhd 𝕜 g univ) {z₀ : E} (hfg : f =ᶠ[𝓝 z₀] g) : f = g :=
  funext fun x =>
    eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq hf hg isPreconnected_univ (mem_univ z₀) hfg (mem_univ x)

end AnalyticOnNhd
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Uniqueness/Variantf3ec60c5ad36958191ab38bd7361139dd0b5a653e17803c6a2cea9e01aea325c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Uniqueness/Variantf3ec60c5ad36958191ab38bd7361139dd0b5a653e17803c6a2cea9e01aea325c.lean#L240).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c18d6a453947926096f7f08f585699b45e11878c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
