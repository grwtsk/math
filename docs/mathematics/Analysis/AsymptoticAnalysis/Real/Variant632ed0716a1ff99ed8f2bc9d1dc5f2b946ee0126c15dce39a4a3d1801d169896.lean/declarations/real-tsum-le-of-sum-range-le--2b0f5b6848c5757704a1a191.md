## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b3d66a1a-79c5-5d52-de58-19781360465d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 109–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Real.tsum_le_of_sum_range_le {f : ℕ → ℝ} {c : ℝ} (hf : ∀ n, 0 ≤ f n)
    (h : ∀ n, ∑ i ∈ Finset.range n, f i ≤ c) : ∑' n, f n ≤ c :=
  (summable_of_sum_range_le hf h).tsum_le_of_sum_range_le h

/-- If a sequence `f` with non-negative terms is dominated by a sequence `g` with summable
series and at least one term of `f` is strictly smaller than the corresponding term in `g`,
then the series of `f` is strictly smaller than the series of `g`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Real/Variant632ed0716a1ff99ed8f2bc9d1dc5f2b946ee0126c15dce39a4a3d1801d169896.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Real/Variant632ed0716a1ff99ed8f2bc9d1dc5f2b946ee0126c15dce39a4a3d1801d169896.lean#L109).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ebbc93419abf5b8686402f07dd751a8d642aec1c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
