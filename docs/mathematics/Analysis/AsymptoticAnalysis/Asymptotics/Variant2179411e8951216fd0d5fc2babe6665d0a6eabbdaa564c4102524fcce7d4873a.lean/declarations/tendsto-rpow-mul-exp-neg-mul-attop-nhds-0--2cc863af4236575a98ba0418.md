## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a662fb0c-ada7-741d-6dd8-95565bc8fb44`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–169.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean

    Tendsto (fun x : ℝ => x ^ s * exp (-b * x)) atTop (𝓝 0) := by
  refine' (tendsto_exp_mul_div_rpow_atTop s b hb).inv_tendsto_atTop.congr' _
  filter_upwards with x using by simp [exp_neg, inv_div, div_eq_mul_inv _ (exp _)]
#align tendsto_rpow_mul_exp_neg_mul_at_top_nhds_0 tendsto_rpow_mul_exp_neg_mul_atTop_nhds_0

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Asymptotics/Variant2179411e8951216fd0d5fc2babe6665d0a6eabbdaa564c4102524fcce7d4873a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Asymptotics/Variant2179411e8951216fd0d5fc2babe6665d0a6eabbdaa564c4102524fcce7d4873a.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e2d1db210e52b9011fcf5c78f7d54d0998b7437` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
