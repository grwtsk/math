## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:442dd6f0-65e8-f40e-f71c-3ed7bfc85a60`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 136–143.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem LocallyIntegrableOn.integrableOn_of_isBigO_atBot [IsMeasurablyGenerated (atBot (α := α))]
    (hf : LocallyIntegrableOn f (Iic a) μ) (ho : f =O[atBot] g)
    (hg : IntegrableAtFilter g atBot μ) : IntegrableOn f (Iic a) μ := by
  refine integrableOn_Iic_iff_integrableAtFilter_atBot.mpr ⟨ho.integrableAtFilter ?_ hg, hf⟩
  exact ⟨Iic a, Iic_mem_atBot a, hf.aestronglyMeasurable⟩

/-- If `f` is locally integrable on `[a, ∞)`, and `f =O[atTop] g`, for some
`g` integrable at `atTop`, then `f` is integrable on `[a, ∞)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Asymptotics/Variantf786b5d64934df431190eeb4024f4f1439941f6648a923e67266d8419d01ff95.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Asymptotics/Variantf786b5d64934df431190eeb4024f4f1439941f6648a923e67266d8419d01ff95.lean#L136).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `65957df1f79bf0913cf02d2a79848e0ddfbb17f0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
