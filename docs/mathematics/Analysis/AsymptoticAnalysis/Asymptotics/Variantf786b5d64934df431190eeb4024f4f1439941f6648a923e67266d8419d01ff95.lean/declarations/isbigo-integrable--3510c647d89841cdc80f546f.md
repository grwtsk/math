## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5a50150f-5187-de5e-9cfd-eff28fb231b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsBigO.integrable (hfm : AEStronglyMeasurable f μ)
    (hf : f =O[⊤] g) (hg : Integrable g μ) : Integrable f μ := by
  rewrite [← integrableAtFilter_top] at *
  exact hf.integrableAtFilter ⟨univ, univ_mem, hfm.restrict⟩ hg

end Basic

variable {ι : Type*} [MeasurableSpace ι] {f : ι × α → E} {s : Set ι} {μ : Measure ι}

/-- Let `f : X x Y → Z`. If as `y` tends to `l`, `f(x, y) = O(g(y))` uniformly on `s : Set X`
of finite measure, then f is eventually (as `y` tends to `l`) integrable along `s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Asymptotics/Variantf786b5d64934df431190eeb4024f4f1439941f6648a923e67266d8419d01ff95.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Asymptotics/Variantf786b5d64934df431190eeb4024f4f1439941f6648a923e67266d8419d01ff95.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `65957df1f79bf0913cf02d2a79848e0ddfbb17f0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
