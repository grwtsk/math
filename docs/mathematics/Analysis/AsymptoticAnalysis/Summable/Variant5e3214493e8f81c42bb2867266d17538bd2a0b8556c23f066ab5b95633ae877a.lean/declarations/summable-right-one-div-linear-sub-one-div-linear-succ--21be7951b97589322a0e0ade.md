## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c0d2dc30-d409-d91c-8db0-c474645201c1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 170–179.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma summable_right_one_div_linear_sub_one_div_linear_succ (m : ℤ) :
    Summable fun b : ℤ ↦ 1 / (m * (z : ℂ) + b) - 1 / (m * z + b + 1) := by
  have := summable_linear_right_add_one_mul_linear_right z m m
  rw [← Finset.summable_compl_iff (s := {0, -1})] at *
  apply this.congr (fun b ↦ ?_)
  simpa [add_assoc, mul_comm] using
    (one_div_linear_sub_one_div_linear_eq z b (b + 1) m (by grind)).symm

/- Acting by `S` (which sends `z` to `-z ⁻¹`) swaps the sums and pulls out a factor of
`(z ^ 2)⁻¹`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Summable/Variant5e3214493e8f81c42bb2867266d17538bd2a0b8556c23f066ab5b95633ae877a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Summable/Variant5e3214493e8f81c42bb2867266d17538bd2a0b8556c23f066ab5b95633ae877a.lean#L170).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9bb830fcbf9f3bb0d2783810427812e64068a064` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
