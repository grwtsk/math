## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a07c9db7-aaee-f077-6456-b07c3d892462`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 623–641.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem truncTotal_subst_eq_truncTotal_sum_subst_truncTotal (ha : HasSubst a)
    (h : ∀ i, (a i).constantCoeff = 0) :
    truncTotal k (f.subst a) = (∑ i ∈ range k, (f.homogeneousComponent i).subst
      (fun i ↦ ((a i).truncTotal k).toMvPowerSeries)).truncTotal k :=
  truncTotal_subst_eq_truncTotal_sum_subst_truncTotal_of_le ha h fun _ ↦ le_refl k

end truncTotal

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Substitution/Variantf0a1bc53097cac08f669261b6e3c9c48ecfef3a750ce91c47b02f922d37198c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Substitution/Variantf0a1bc53097cac08f669261b6e3c9c48ecfef3a750ce91c47b02f922d37198c2.lean#L623).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a91e921819b605ae2907dddfea54663b2e353ef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
