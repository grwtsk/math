## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ae419e61-c11b-d6cb-a0c9-3401db62b1a6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 191–204.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem comap_ofFunction {β} (f : β → α) (h : Monotone m ∨ Surjective f) :
    comap f (OuterMeasure.ofFunction m m_empty) =
      OuterMeasure.ofFunction (fun s => m (f '' s)) (by simp; simp [m_empty]) := by
  refine le_antisymm (le_ofFunction.2 fun s => ?_) fun s => ?_

    refine iInf_mono' fun ht => ?_
    rw [Set.image_subset_iff, preimage_iUnion] at ht
    refine ⟨ht, ENNReal.tsum_le_tsum fun n => ?_⟩
    rcases h with hl | hr
    exacts [hl (image_preimage_subset _ _), (congr_arg m (hr.image_preimage (t n))).le]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/OfFunction/Variant3a85723a2be82b88a0772da27e1f051dac6bcc54e8420e6c9c36eab85b19a2e0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/OfFunction/Variant3a85723a2be82b88a0772da27e1f051dac6bcc54e8420e6c9c36eab85b19a2e0.lean#L191).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f896a76230c86e4b849d924fcac25c248105b87` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
