## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e7035e4e-4e45-b57d-766c-efb0b533f887`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 305–321.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem comap_boundedBy {β} (f : β → α)
    (h : (Monotone fun s : { s : Set α // s.Nonempty } => m s) ∨ Surjective f) :
    comap f (boundedBy m) = boundedBy fun s => m (f '' s) := by
  refine (comap_ofFunction _ ?_).trans ?_
  · refine h.imp (fun H s t hst => iSup_le fun hs => ?_) id
    have ht : t.Nonempty := hs.mono hst
    exact (@H ⟨s, hs⟩ ⟨t, ht⟩ hst).trans (le_iSup (fun _ : t.Nonempty => m t) ht)
  · dsimp only [boundedBy]
    congr with s : 1
    rw [image_nonempty]

/-- If `m u = ∞` for any set `u` that has nonempty intersection both with `s` and `t`, then
`μ (s ∪ t) = μ s + μ t`, where `μ = MeasureTheory.OuterMeasure.boundedBy m`.

E.g., if `α` is an (e)metric space and `m u = ∞` on any set of diameter `≥ r`, then this lemma
implies that `μ (s ∪ t) = μ s + μ t` on any two sets such that `r ≤ edist x y` for all `x ∈ s`
and `y ∈ t`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/OfFunction/Variant3a85723a2be82b88a0772da27e1f051dac6bcc54e8420e6c9c36eab85b19a2e0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/OfFunction/Variant3a85723a2be82b88a0772da27e1f051dac6bcc54e8420e6c9c36eab85b19a2e0.lean#L305).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f896a76230c86e4b849d924fcac25c248105b87` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
