## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:568aaf98-c34d-2c7e-5be5-3d29d03fbd6b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 524–544.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- **Phragmen-Lindelöf principle** in the third quadrant. Let `f : ℂ → E` be a function such that

* `f` is differentiable in the open third quadrant and is continuous on its closure;
* `‖f z‖` is bounded from above by `A * exp (B * (abs z) ^ c)` on the open third quadrant
  for some `c < 2`;
* `‖f z‖` is bounded from above by a constant `C` on the boundary of the third quadrant.

Then `‖f z‖` is bounded from above by the same constant on the closed third quadrant. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/PhragmenLindelof/Variantf0b84b3e021a06cc5dea7cd1c3c1afaf3ab1bbdcf597c8a3c2e124a9830076f9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/PhragmenLindelof/Variantf0b84b3e021a06cc5dea7cd1c3c1afaf3ab1bbdcf597c8a3c2e124a9830076f9.lean#L524).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7f32921e752cd12d6e087e8468d3fe443cf558bf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
