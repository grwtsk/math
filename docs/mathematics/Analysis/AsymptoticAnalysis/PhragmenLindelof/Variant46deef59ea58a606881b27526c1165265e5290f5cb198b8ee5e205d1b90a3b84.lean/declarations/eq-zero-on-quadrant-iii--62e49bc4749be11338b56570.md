## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0c783b78-dddf-3d40-6443-7fa2d7bc6d11`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 541–556.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_zero_on_quadrant_III (hd : DiffContOnCl ℂ f (Iio 0 ×ℂ Iio 0))
    (hB : ∃ c < (2 : ℝ), ∃ B,
      f =O[cobounded ℂ ⊓ 𝓟 (Iio 0 ×ℂ Iio 0)] fun z => expR (B * ‖z‖ ^ c))
    (hre : ∀ x : ℝ, x ≤ 0 → f x = 0) (him : ∀ x : ℝ, x ≤ 0 → f (x * I) = 0) :
    EqOn f 0 {z | z.re ≤ 0 ∧ z.im ≤ 0} := fun _z hz =>
  norm_le_zero_iff.1 <| quadrant_III hd hB (fun x hx => norm_le_zero_iff.2 <| hre x hx)
    (fun x hx => norm_le_zero_iff.2 <| him x hx) hz.1 hz.2

/-- **Phragmen-Lindelöf principle** in the third quadrant. Let `f g : ℂ → E` be functions such that

* `f` and `g` are differentiable in the open third quadrant and are continuous on its closure;
* `‖f z‖` and `‖g z‖` are bounded from above by `A * exp(B * ‖z‖ ^ c)` on the open third
  quadrant for some `A`, `B`, and `c < 2`;
* `f` is equal to `g` on the boundary of the third quadrant.

Then `f` is equal to `g` on the closed third quadrant. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/PhragmenLindelof/Variant46deef59ea58a606881b27526c1165265e5290f5cb198b8ee5e205d1b90a3b84.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/PhragmenLindelof/Variant46deef59ea58a606881b27526c1165265e5290f5cb198b8ee5e205d1b90a3b84.lean#L541).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
