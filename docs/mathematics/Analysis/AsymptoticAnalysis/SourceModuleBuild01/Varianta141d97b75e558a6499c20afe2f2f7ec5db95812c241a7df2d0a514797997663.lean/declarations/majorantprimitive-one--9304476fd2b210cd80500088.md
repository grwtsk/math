## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e255dd2d-49cb-031a-01e3-6a94ce993bad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 112–120.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem majorantPrimitive_one {c : ℝ} (hc : 1 < c) :
    majorantPrimitive c 1 = -dirichletBudget c := by
  have hc0 : c - 1 ≠ 0 := by linarith
  simp only [majorantPrimitive, Real.log_one, add_zero, Real.one_rpow, mul_one,
    dirichletBudget]
  field_simp
  ring

/-- Finite-interval integral with its full nonnegative endpoint remainder. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/SourceModuleBuild01/Varianta141d97b75e558a6499c20afe2f2f7ec5db95812c241a7df2d0a514797997663.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/SourceModuleBuild01/Varianta141d97b75e558a6499c20afe2f2f7ec5db95812c241a7df2d0a514797997663.lean#L112).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `99b6e5176d5221a8ae80a9a7e88570e157e2c673` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
