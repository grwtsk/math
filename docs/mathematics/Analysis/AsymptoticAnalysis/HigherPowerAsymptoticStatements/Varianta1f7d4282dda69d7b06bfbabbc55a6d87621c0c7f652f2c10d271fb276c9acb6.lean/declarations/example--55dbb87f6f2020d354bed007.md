## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0e84645e1b1da11e6bceedff4f119aa7391560e244ee758bcba4851d8cda1c86`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 709–714.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example (A : ℝ) (p k : ℕ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    |Real.log (p : ℝ) / (p : ℝ) ^ ((k : ℝ) / 2) *
      (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A ((k : ℝ) * Real.log (p : ℝ)) - 1)| ≤
        (65 / (6 * A ^ 2)) * higherMoment p k :=
  HigherPowerAsymptoticScratch.higherPower_deviation_term_bound A p k hA

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/HigherPowerAsymptoticStatements/Varianta1f7d4282dda69d7b06bfbabbc55a6d87621c0c7f652f2c10d271fb276c9acb6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/HigherPowerAsymptoticStatements/Varianta1f7d4282dda69d7b06bfbabbc55a6d87621c0c7f652f2c10d271fb276c9acb6.lean#L709).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e19f124cbc567f86c2a2c15dd42c62245b68c01b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
