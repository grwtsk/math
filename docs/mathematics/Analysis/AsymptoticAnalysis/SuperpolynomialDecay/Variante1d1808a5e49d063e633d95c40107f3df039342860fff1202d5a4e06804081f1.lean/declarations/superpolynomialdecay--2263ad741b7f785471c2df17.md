## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:59183259e17c77a77aee63fdf818d3bf4729d5fb4a26de58cad73a707aca0ea4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 54–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def SuperpolynomialDecay {α β : Type*} [TopologicalSpace β] [CommSemiring β] (l : Filter α)
    (k : α → β) (f : α → β) :=
  ∀ n : ℕ, Tendsto (fun a : α => k a ^ n * f a) l (𝓝 0)

variable {α β : Type*} {l : Filter α} {k : α → β} {f g g' : α → β}

section CommSemiring

variable [TopologicalSpace β] [CommSemiring β]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/SuperpolynomialDecay/Variante1d1808a5e49d063e633d95c40107f3df039342860fff1202d5a4e06804081f1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/SuperpolynomialDecay/Variante1d1808a5e49d063e633d95c40107f3df039342860fff1202d5a4e06804081f1.lean#L54).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cf42927936151d2269bf8181b55c8d38999e4e15` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
