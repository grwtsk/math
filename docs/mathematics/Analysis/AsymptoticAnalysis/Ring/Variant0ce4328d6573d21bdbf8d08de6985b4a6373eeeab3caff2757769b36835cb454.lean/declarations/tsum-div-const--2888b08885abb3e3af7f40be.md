## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:193d9ac2-d12c-529f-1d94-ea4838f65678`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 135–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Multipliying two infinite sums

In this section, we prove various results about `(∑' x : ι, f x) * (∑' y : κ, g y)`. Note that we
always assume that the family `λ x : ι × κ, f x.1 * g x.2` is summable, since there is no way to
deduce this from the summabilities of `f` and `g` in general, but if you are working in a normed
space, you may want to use the analogous lemmas in `Analysis/NormedSpace/Basic`
(e.g `tsum_mul_tsum_of_summable_norm`).

We first establish results about arbitrary index types, `ι` and `κ`, and then we specialize to
`ι = κ = ℕ` to prove the Cauchy product formula (see `tsum_mul_tsum_eq_tsum_sum_antidiagonal`).

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Ring/Variant0ce4328d6573d21bdbf8d08de6985b4a6373eeeab3caff2757769b36835cb454.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Ring/Variant0ce4328d6573d21bdbf8d08de6985b4a6373eeeab3caff2757769b36835cb454.lean#L135).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d9e328f49ab5ed8fb7e76b20f1d60b82f364a8c1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
