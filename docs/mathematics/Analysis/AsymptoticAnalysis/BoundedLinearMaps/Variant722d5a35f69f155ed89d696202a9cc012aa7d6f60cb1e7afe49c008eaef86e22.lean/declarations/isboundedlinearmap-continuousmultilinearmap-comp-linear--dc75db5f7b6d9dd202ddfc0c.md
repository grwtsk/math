## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6843ab34-bf32-2ee7-6e26-f452c64e6694`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 348–359.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isBoundedLinearMap_continuousMultilinearMap_comp_linear (g : G →L[𝕜] E) :
    IsBoundedLinearMap 𝕜 fun f : ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 (fun _ : ι => E) F =>
      f.compContinuousLinearMap fun _ => g :=
  (ContinuousMultilinearMap.compContinuousLinearMapL (ι := ι) (F := F) (fun _ ↦ g))
    |>.isBoundedLinearMap

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/BoundedLinearMaps/Variant722d5a35f69f155ed89d696202a9cc012aa7d6f60cb1e7afe49c008eaef86e22.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/BoundedLinearMaps/Variant722d5a35f69f155ed89d696202a9cc012aa7d6f60cb1e7afe49c008eaef86e22.lean#L348).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `caa4360e4702bc787f9b0a0b31d11c3503c1371f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
