## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8ad691206037041cf67b7af50391dbf6d6e2a48d249645d799226260116c03e4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 366–371.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IsBoundedBilinearMap.toContinuousLinearMap (hf : IsBoundedBilinearMap 𝕜 f) :
    E →L[𝕜] F →L[𝕜] G :=
  LinearMap.mkContinuousOfExistsBound₂
    (LinearMap.mk₂ _ f.curry hf.add_left hf.smul_left hf.add_right hf.smul_right) <|
    hf.bound.imp fun _ ↦ And.right

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/BoundedLinearMaps/Variant6c5fbe35d181af2ece8a4b2927ab5043a091c741de4ca75a82cb92dcc472095b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/BoundedLinearMaps/Variant6c5fbe35d181af2ece8a4b2927ab5043a091c741de4ca75a82cb92dcc472095b.lean#L366).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `37d71acde5dc46c9c8bd1dc72868db8e1cc791f2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
