## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:55098531-d893-aa12-42a3-c0f72e7c13d4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 148–159.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem tendsto (x : E) (hf : IsBoundedLinearMap 𝕜 f) : Tendsto f (𝓝 x) (𝓝 (f x)) :=
  let ⟨hf, M, _, hM⟩ := hf

    squeeze_zero (fun _ => norm_nonneg _)

          ‖f e - f x‖ = ‖hf.mk' f (e - x)‖ := by rw [(hf.mk' _).map_sub e x]; rfl
          _ ≤ M * ‖e - x‖ := hM (e - x)
          )
      (suffices Tendsto (fun e : E => M * ‖e - x‖) (𝓝 x) (𝓝 (M * 0)) by simpa
      tendsto_const_nhds.mul (tendsto_norm_sub_self _))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/BoundedLinearMaps/Variant76ce6916fae329473d94469e4a1c71a4e61ed5d86cd82a825638252860e6a168.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/BoundedLinearMaps/Variant76ce6916fae329473d94469e4a1c71a4e61ed5d86cd82a825638252860e6a168.lean#L148).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0b60a2c186c0a2aa44ea7c16ce0f23fc691d2a15` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
