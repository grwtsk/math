## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:22f97ffb-edac-3dbc-f4e9-154921982b1f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 179–196.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_add_disjointOfDiff_of_subset (hC : IsSetSemiring C)
    (hs : s ∈ C) (ht : t ∈ C) (hst : s ⊆ t) :
    m t = m s + ∑ i ∈ hC.disjointOfDiff ht hs, m i := by
  conv_lhs => rw [← hC.sUnion_insert_disjointOfDiff ht hs hst]
  rw [← coe_insert, addContent_sUnion]
  · rw [sum_insert]
    exact hC.notMem_disjointOfDiff ht hs
  · rw [coe_insert]
    exact Set.insert_subset hs (hC.subset_disjointOfDiff ht hs)
  · rw [coe_insert]
    exact hC.pairwiseDisjoint_insert_disjointOfDiff ht hs
  · rw [coe_insert]
    rwa [hC.sUnion_insert_disjointOfDiff ht hs hst]

/-- If a set can be written in two different ways as a disjoint union of elements of a semi-ring
of sets `C`, then the sums of the values of `m : addContent C` along the two decompositions give
the same result.
In other words, `m` can be canonically extended to finite unions of elements of `C`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/AddContent/Variant5143794f0c54fb8f0f7b3d7d6ff5e78628fda004f02a3247f06c53ee4714a6f4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/AddContent/Variant5143794f0c54fb8f0f7b3d7d6ff5e78628fda004f02a3247f06c53ee4714a6f4.lean#L179).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b5d77c88c308407f1310d1dd0106b3c4ed916648` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
