## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1fa68ef8ee276eaf5f661b5e0926f29f484e3a9da6af703b87e27d2536f19ead`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 244–251.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance filterAt_neBot (x : α) : (v.filterAt x).NeBot := by
  simp only [neBot_iff, ← empty_mem_iff_bot, mem_filterAt_iff, not_exists, exists_prop,
    mem_empty_iff_false, and_true_iff, gt_iff_lt, not_and, Ne.def, not_false_iff, not_forall]
  intro ε εpos
  obtain ⟨w, w_sets, hw⟩ : ∃ w ∈ v.setsAt x, w ⊆ closedBall x ε := v.Nontrivial x ε εpos
  exact ⟨w, w_sets, hw⟩
#align vitali_family.filter_at_ne_bot VitaliFamily.filterAt_neBot

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/VitaliFamily/Variant93f325fb8aacf0a85ad09d545edbc830a2ee159db6060ea451ac308f8b819c4a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/VitaliFamily/Variant93f325fb8aacf0a85ad09d545edbc830a2ee159db6060ea451ac308f8b819c4a.lean#L244).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ca83846355bb18f6af94af916fdb3fd812a15601` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
