## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6603b6a9cc19cd4301a9ab25f1dd4eff5c53443b6c915991f1305b70073dbd17`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toAffineIsometryEquiv [Inhabited P₁] (li : P₁ →ᵃⁱ[𝕜] P₂) (h : finrank 𝕜 V₁ = finrank 𝕜 V₂) :
    P₁ ≃ᵃⁱ[𝕜] P₂ :=
  AffineIsometryEquiv.mk' li (li.linearIsometry.toLinearIsometryEquiv h)
    (Inhabited.default (α := P₁)) fun p => by simp
#align affine_isometry.to_affine_isometry_equiv AffineIsometry.toAffineIsometryEquiv

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/FiniteDimension/Variant564f5f03de80859fd8c7bfe13ecf9e956c8375007af02bf958c1ab8c7f6af562.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/FiniteDimension/Variant564f5f03de80859fd8c7bfe13ecf9e956c8375007af02bf958c1ab8c7f6af562.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c536b44ca373d3bed427c4225dd17f6a03117da1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
