## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1f78cc0b9f2aa32bfa360670df4df294e93c2a3a8ba8610fe04c707d0f0b9ffa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 516–539.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

def ContinuousLinearEquiv.piRing (ι : Type*) [Fintype ι] [DecidableEq ι] :
    ((ι → 𝕜) →L[𝕜] E) ≃L[𝕜] ι → E :=
  { LinearMap.toContinuousLinearMap.symm.trans (LinearEquiv.piRing 𝕜 E ι 𝕜) with
    continuous_toFun := by
      refine continuous_pi fun i => ?_
      exact (ContinuousLinearMap.apply 𝕜 E (Pi.single i 1)).continuous
    continuous_invFun := by
      simp_rw [LinearEquiv.invFun_eq_symm, LinearEquiv.trans_symm, LinearEquiv.symm_symm]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/FiniteDimension/Variant0b74f5c5fb195ed54f451269071f3f72ee1c230ca25d216d118496fc9597aca7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/FiniteDimension/Variant0b74f5c5fb195ed54f451269071f3f72ee1c230ca25d216d118496fc9597aca7.lean#L516).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a6217642fb765a3f0af997f15bae67ff2364b280` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
