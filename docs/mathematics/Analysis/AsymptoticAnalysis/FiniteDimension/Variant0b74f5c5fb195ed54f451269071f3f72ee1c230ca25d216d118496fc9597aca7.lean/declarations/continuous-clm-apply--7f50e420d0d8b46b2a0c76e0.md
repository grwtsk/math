## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:76b6b385-621d-9986-7cec-b5e73bfffee3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 551–565.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    {f : X → E →L[𝕜] F} : Continuous f ↔ ∀ y, Continuous (f · y) := by

variable (𝕜 : Type u) [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜] (E : Type v) [NormedAddCommGroup E]
  [NormedSpace 𝕜 E] [LocallyCompactSpace 𝕜]

/-- Any finite-dimensional vector space over a locally compact field is proper.
We do not register this as an instance to avoid an instance loop when trying to prove the
properness of `𝕜`, and the search for `𝕜` as an unknown metavariable. Declare the instance
explicitly when needed. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/FiniteDimension/Variant0b74f5c5fb195ed54f451269071f3f72ee1c230ca25d216d118496fc9597aca7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/FiniteDimension/Variant0b74f5c5fb195ed54f451269071f3f72ee1c230ca25d216d118496fc9597aca7.lean#L551).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a6217642fb765a3f0af997f15bae67ff2364b280` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
