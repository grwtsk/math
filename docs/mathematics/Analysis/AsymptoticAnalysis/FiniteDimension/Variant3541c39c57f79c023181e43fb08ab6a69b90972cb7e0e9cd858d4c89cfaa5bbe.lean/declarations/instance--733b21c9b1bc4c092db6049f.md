## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2165664c684ce369767389b008d20b09eadc9d0389bb369b35a0c23deeacf146`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 573–584.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {𝕜 E : Type*} [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜] [CompleteSpace 𝕜]
    [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E] [LocallyCompactSpace E] (S : Submodule 𝕜 E) :
    ProperSpace S := by
  nontriviality E
  have : ProperSpace 𝕜 := .of_locallyCompact_module 𝕜 E
  have : FiniteDimensional 𝕜 E := .of_locallyCompactSpace 𝕜
  exact FiniteDimensional.proper 𝕜 S

/-- If `E` is a finite dimensional normed real vector space, `x : E`, and `s` is a neighborhood of
`x` that is not equal to the whole space, then there exists a point `y ∈ frontier s` at distance
`Metric.infDist x sᶜ` from `x`. See also
`IsCompact.exists_mem_frontier_infDist_compl_eq_dist`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/FiniteDimension/Variant3541c39c57f79c023181e43fb08ab6a69b90972cb7e0e9cd858d4c89cfaa5bbe.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/FiniteDimension/Variant3541c39c57f79c023181e43fb08ab6a69b90972cb7e0e9cd858d4c89cfaa5bbe.lean#L573).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b062d90de34c20f22dad20698201f7fd979ca193` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
