## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8f22667f-e629-930f-e739-37aa9cefaef0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem partialSum_continuous (p : FormalMultilinearSeries 𝕜 E F) (n : ℕ) :
    Continuous (p.partialSum n) := by
  unfold partialSum
  fun_prop

end FormalMultilinearSeries

/-! ### The radius of a formal multilinear series -/

variable [NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜] [NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace 𝕜 E] [NormedAddCommGroup F]
  [NormedSpace 𝕜 F] [NormedAddCommGroup G] [NormedSpace 𝕜 G]

namespace FormalMultilinearSeries

variable (p : FormalMultilinearSeries 𝕜 E F) {r : ℝ≥0}

/-- The radius of a formal multilinear series is the largest `r` such that the sum `Σ ‖pₙ‖ ‖y‖ⁿ`
converges for all `‖y‖ < r`. This implies that `Σ pₙ yⁿ` converges for all `‖y‖ < r`, but these
definitions are *not* equivalent in general. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/ConvergenceRadius/Variant54fd395dab0e743a2273317d71baaed300af30fc2f9401a9bd196a9fff3bad26.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/ConvergenceRadius/Variant54fd395dab0e743a2273317d71baaed300af30fc2f9401a9bd196a9fff3bad26.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `13432c418571c74bea4a2a728d91dc64f4f6bdf0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
