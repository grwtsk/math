## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3895fe6c-140b-88fd-d1df-22fd309a9ec7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 63–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    · exact Or.inl ⟨p, hp.nat_prime, by simpa [hk2] using hpn⟩
    · exact Or.inr ⟨p, k, hp.nat_prime, by omega, hpn⟩
  · rintro (hs | hh)
    · refine ⟨primeSquare_not_prime n hs, ?_⟩
      obtain ⟨p, hp, hpn⟩ := hs
      exact ⟨p, 2, hp.prime, by norm_num, hpn⟩
    · refine ⟨higher_not_prime n hh, ?_⟩
      obtain ⟨p, k, hp, hk, hpn⟩ := hh
      exact ⟨p, k, hp.prime, by omega, hpn⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/HigherPowerTsumAudit/Variantca3ad69738c0ca0c4fad0cec6f20e63861fec59fb8115f1e80614f2abdf78970.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/HigherPowerTsumAudit/Variantca3ad69738c0ca0c4fad0cec6f20e63861fec59fb8115f1e80614f2abdf78970.lean#L63).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d4bbbbd43672f6b85490124b574d6b1c195a8323` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
