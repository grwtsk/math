## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0c73defd-7506-0658-8416-82b8ecf68c54`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 144–153.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem riesz_occurrence_majorant_summable : Summable rieszOccurrenceMajorant := by
  have hsum : Summable (fun o : ZeroOccurrence ↦
      (64 * rieszDecayConstant) * (1 + ‖shiftedValue o‖) ^ (-6 : ℝ)) :=
    ZeroShellCount.zero_summability.mul_left _
  apply hsum.of_norm_bounded_eventually
  filter_upwards [eventually_one_le_shifted_norm] with o ho
  rw [Real.norm_eq_abs, abs_of_nonneg (riesz_occurrence_majorant_nonneg o)]
  simp [rieszOccurrenceMajorant, ho]

/-- Every native rational-transform value is bounded by the same majorant for all radii. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/RieszZeroSummability/Variant2793972d0d610f2a41b041e7ed9d03ca774d61e4bd62d5c7730df8bfb2f33e3d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/RieszZeroSummability/Variant2793972d0d610f2a41b041e7ed9d03ca774d61e4bd62d5c7730df8bfb2f33e3d.lean#L144).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8efa9bdd38506dec34f6a5f7fcfbbb867f6bcf33` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
