## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e910bc3f-4ed7-f40b-f5af-f273a3e6b6d4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 460–471.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma tendsto_abs_logb_atTop (hb : b ≠ -1 ∧ b ≠ 0 ∧ b ≠ 1) :
    Tendsto (|logb b ·|) atTop atTop := by
  wlog hb₀ : 0 < b generalizing b
  · exact (this (b := -b) (by simp [hb, neg_eq_iff_eq_neg]) (by linarith +splitNe)).congr (by simp)
  wlog hb₁ : 1 < b generalizing b
  · exact (this (b := b⁻¹) (by simp [hb, inv_eq_iff_eq_inv, inv_neg]) (by simpa)
      ((one_lt_inv₀ hb₀).2 (by linarith +splitNe))).congr (by simp)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Base/Varianta420bb0bd95002655a9c4f35f14c096765e9a36c4bc2c50ccc1e0d18e6fd709b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Base/Varianta420bb0bd95002655a9c4f35f14c096765e9a36c4bc2c50ccc1e0d18e6fd709b.lean#L460).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f0d46814e45181e935356cd687f0bc8c17db2ed0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
