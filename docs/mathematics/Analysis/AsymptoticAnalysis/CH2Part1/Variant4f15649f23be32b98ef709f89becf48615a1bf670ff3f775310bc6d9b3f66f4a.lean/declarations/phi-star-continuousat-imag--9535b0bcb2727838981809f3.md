## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fabfe10b-6867-db23-1131-5486edd51c2f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1954–1968.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    ContinuousAt (fun s : ℝ ↦ Phi_star ν ε (I * ↑s)) t := by
  simp only [Phi_star]
  have h_eq (s : ℝ) : -2 * π * I * (I * s) + ν = ↑(2 * π * s + ν) := by

    have hg : ContinuousAt (fun x : ℝ ↦ B ε ↑x) (f t) :=
      B.continuousAt_ofReal_ne_zero ε (f t) (by nlinarith [Real.pi_pos])
    exact hg.comp hf
  · exact continuousAt_const

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/CH2Part1/Variant4f15649f23be32b98ef709f89becf48615a1bf670ff3f775310bc6d9b3f66f4a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/CH2Part1/Variant4f15649f23be32b98ef709f89becf48615a1bf670ff3f775310bc6d9b3f66f4a.lean#L1954).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fe1ca3fba3ce69f1a74f1c88c8189358b833ea04` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
