## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:06094a37-20e0-0cbb-2fc4-0a6a4273780c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 42–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sourceCorrelation_deviation_integral (A t : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A t - 1 =
      ∫ u in 0..t, deriv (sourceCorrelation explicitSecondDerivative A) u := by
  rw [intervalIntegral.integral_deriv_eq_sub
    (fun u _ => ((sourceCorrelation_contDiff A (by linarith)).differentiable (by norm_num)) u)
    (sourceCorrelation_derivative_intervalIntegrable A 0 t hA),
    EstimateCorrelation.actual_correlation_at_zero A hA]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/HigherPowerAsymptoticAudit/Variant612182f86049d4bace1e0a01aaf7cc623b31708109964095100d38fdaf9c38a7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/HigherPowerAsymptoticAudit/Variant612182f86049d4bace1e0a01aaf7cc623b31708109964095100d38fdaf9c38a7.lean#L42).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2a1e2b419080e3f9c808bd6970cf5a642ad3a18e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
