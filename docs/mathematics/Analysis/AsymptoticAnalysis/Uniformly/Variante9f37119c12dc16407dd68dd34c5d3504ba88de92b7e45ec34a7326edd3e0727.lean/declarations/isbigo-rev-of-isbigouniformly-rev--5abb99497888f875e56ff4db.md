## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2624cfef-5e92-22bc-ad34-4f343e04e9aa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 54–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isBigO_rev_of_isBigOUniformly_rev (h : (g ∘ Prod.snd) =O[𝓟 s ×ˢ l] f) {i : ι}
    (hi : i ∈ s) : g =O[l] fun x ↦ f (i, x) := by
  obtain ⟨C, hC⟩ := h.bound
  obtain ⟨t, htl, ht⟩ := hC.exists_mem
  obtain ⟨u, hu, v, hv, huv⟩ := Filter.mem_prod_iff.mp htl
  refine isBigO_iff.mpr ⟨C, Filter.eventually_iff_exists_mem.mpr ⟨v, hv, ?_⟩⟩
  exact fun y hy ↦ ht (i, y) <| huv ⟨hu hi, hy⟩

/-- If f = Θ(g) uniformly on `s`, then f_i = Θ(g) for any i.` -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Uniformly/Variante9f37119c12dc16407dd68dd34c5d3504ba88de92b7e45ec34a7326edd3e0727.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Uniformly/Variante9f37119c12dc16407dd68dd34c5d3504ba88de92b7e45ec34a7326edd3e0727.lean#L54).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cfb2d408b233957fd20ceccf75b8ccb5285f62f5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
