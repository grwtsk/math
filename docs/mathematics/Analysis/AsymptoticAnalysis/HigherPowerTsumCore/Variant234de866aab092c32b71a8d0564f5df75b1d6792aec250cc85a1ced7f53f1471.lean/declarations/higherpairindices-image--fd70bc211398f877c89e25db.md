## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:db44efa1-7762-04c3-dcb9-6e486dd30779`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 59–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem higherPairIndices_image (A : ℝ) :
    (higherPairIndices A).image powerIndex = higherPrimePowerIndices A := by
  classical
  ext n
  constructor
  · rintro hn
    obtain ⟨q, hq, rfl⟩ := Finset.mem_image.mp hn
    exact Finset.mem_preimage.mp hq
  · intro hn
    obtain ⟨p, k, hp, hk, hpn⟩ := (Finset.mem_filter.mp hn).2
    let q : HigherPowerIndex := (⟨p, hp⟩, ⟨k, hk⟩)
    have hq : powerIndex q = n := hpn
    exact Finset.mem_image.mpr ⟨q, Finset.mem_preimage.mpr (hq ▸ hn), hq⟩

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/HigherPowerTsumCore/Variant234de866aab092c32b71a8d0564f5df75b1d6792aec250cc85a1ced7f53f1471.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/HigherPowerTsumCore/Variant234de866aab092c32b71a8d0564f5df75b1d6792aec250cc85a1ced7f53f1471.lean#L59).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `156e08e0593496c0f67d017cf4a3ca42ea97eff2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
