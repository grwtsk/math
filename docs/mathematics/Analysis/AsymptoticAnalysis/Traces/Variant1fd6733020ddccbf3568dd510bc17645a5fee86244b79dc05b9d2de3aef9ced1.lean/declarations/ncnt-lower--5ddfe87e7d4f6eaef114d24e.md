## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fe0fa4ba-6bbf-a8fa-bddf-661abeb927f1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 288–300.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private lemma Ncnt_lower : ∀ᶠ T in atTop, T * l T / (4 * π) ≤ D.Ncnt T := by
  obtain ⟨A, hA, hN⟩ := h.rvm.eventually_le
  filter_upwards [hN, eventually_ge_atTop (4 * π * A), eventually_l_ge 0] with T hN hTA hl
  have hπ := Real.pi_pos
  have h1 : -(A * l T) ≤ D.Ncnt T - T * ell1 T / (2 * π) := (abs_le.mp hN).1
  have h2 : T * l T ≤ T * ell1 T := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left (l_le_ell1 T) (by nlinarith)
  have h3 : T * l T / (2 * π) ≤ T * ell1 T / (2 * π) :=
    div_le_div_of_nonneg_right h2 (by positivity)
  have h4 : T * l T / (4 * π) = T * l T / (2 * π) - T * l T / (4 * π) := by ring
  have h5 : A * l T ≤ T * l T / (4 * π) := by
    rw [le_div_iff₀ (by positivity)]; nlinarith
  linarith

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Traces/Variant1fd6733020ddccbf3568dd510bc17645a5fee86244b79dc05b9d2de3aef9ced1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Traces/Variant1fd6733020ddccbf3568dd510bc17645a5fee86244b79dc05b9d2de3aef9ced1.lean#L288).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2fcd6f6db026d97bd8254fdc7c05b9871d8c0b29` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
