## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a165171b-c233-f0ad-1fd5-9e383572932a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 532–548.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tracesBoundsXi_of_factsXi : TracesBoundsXi P D.aT D.bT D.JT D.trG D.trG2 D.Ncnt where
  tr1' := tr1' h
  tr2 := tr2 h
  ratio := ratio h
  frhat := frhat h

end Assembly

/-! ## From the trace package to the δ-form hat-unit moments (the shape of `CoeffMoments`)

With `tr M̂ᵀ = tr G̃/(aL)` and `‖M̂ᵀ‖²_F = tr G̃²/(aL)²`, and the window limit `cRatio(λ₁; a_T, b_T, J_T) → c∞ > 0`
(XiPrime/Window.lean), the package gives: for every δ > 0, eventually
`(1−δ)N ≤ tr G̃/(aL) ≤ (1+δ)N` and `tr G̃²/(aL)² ≤ (c∞⁻¹ + δ) N`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Traces/Variant1fd6733020ddccbf3568dd510bc17645a5fee86244b79dc05b9d2de3aef9ced1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Traces/Variant1fd6733020ddccbf3568dd510bc17645a5fee86244b79dc05b9d2de3aef9ced1.lean#L532).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2fcd6f6db026d97bd8254fdc7c05b9871d8c0b29` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
