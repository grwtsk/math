## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:9216a3e28c36bd7882d3e286caaa5426dfe46eba6be92fe88f062dbea1a3b4e9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 300–317.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instL1NormedAlgebra : NormedAlgebra 𝕜 (tsze R M) where
  norm_smul_le := _root_.norm_smul_le

end Algebra


end Normed

section

variable [RCLike 𝕜] [NormedRing R] [NormedAddCommGroup M]
variable [NormedAlgebra 𝕜 R] [NormedSpace 𝕜 M] [Module R M] [Module Rᵐᵒᵖ M]
variable [IsBoundedSMul R M] [IsBoundedSMul Rᵐᵒᵖ M] [SMulCommClass R Rᵐᵒᵖ M]
variable [IsScalarTower 𝕜 R M] [IsScalarTower 𝕜 Rᵐᵒᵖ M]
variable [CompleteSpace R] [CompleteSpace M]

-- Evidence that we have sufficient instances on `tsze R N`
-- to make `NormedSpace.exp_add_of_commute` usable
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/TrivSqZeroExt/Variant2afe79cd3c871354e4e8ed4faaaddf329420ed740566e5099b157c51d12fa1e1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/TrivSqZeroExt/Variant2afe79cd3c871354e4e8ed4faaaddf329420ed740566e5099b157c51d12fa1e1.lean#L300).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c14d8f72f5056142e93c73729d30d16ad338386d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
