## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6fc90db7-9291-74c4-10b2-0648adae7f3a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 500–507.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem digamma_series {z : ℂ} (hz : z ∈ Complex.integerComplement) :
    Complex.digamma z = -(Real.eulerMascheroniConstant : ℂ) - 1 / z
      + ∑' n : ℕ, (1 / ((n : ℂ) + 1) - 1 / (z + n + 1)) := by
  rw [(hasSum_digamma_series hz).tsum_eq]
  ring

end DigammaSeries
end Zeta23
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Series/Variantfd349c62fe098fb919bf5120a0df057995c6474e5f369d72e9973657feb5c344.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Series/Variantfd349c62fe098fb919bf5120a0df057995c6474e5f369d72e9973657feb5c344.lean#L500).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
