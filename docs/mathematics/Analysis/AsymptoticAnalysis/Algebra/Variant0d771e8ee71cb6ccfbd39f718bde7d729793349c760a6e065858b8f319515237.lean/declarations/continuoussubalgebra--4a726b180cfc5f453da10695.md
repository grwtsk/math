## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4adb5502ebf43eb2eac8905f945dd3588b35f486474af9464ee2650facbba615`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 705–719.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def continuousSubalgebra : Subalgebra R (α → A) :=
  { continuousSubsemiring α A with
    carrier := { f : α → A | Continuous f }
    algebraMap_mem' := fun r => (continuous_const : Continuous fun _ : α => algebraMap R A r) }
#align continuous_subalgebra continuousSubalgebra

end Subtype

section ContinuousMap

variable {α : Type*} [TopologicalSpace α] {R : Type*} [CommSemiring R] {A : Type*}
  [TopologicalSpace A] [Semiring A] [Algebra R A] [TopologicalSemiring A] {A₂ : Type*}
  [TopologicalSpace A₂] [Semiring A₂] [Algebra R A₂] [TopologicalSemiring A₂]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Algebra/Variant0d771e8ee71cb6ccfbd39f718bde7d729793349c760a6e065858b8f319515237.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Algebra/Variant0d771e8ee71cb6ccfbd39f718bde7d729793349c760a6e065858b8f319515237.lean#L705).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7a58c5304e2ff3ea638f999de8e3bb817156c0ce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
