## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8f87cae81501a156971d8a3907923a7b12d9eef07e3cfad77f738bc1ac00e46a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 645–654.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [Monoid R] [AddMonoid M] [DistribMulAction R M] [ContinuousAdd M]
    [ContinuousConstSMul R M] : DistribMulAction R C(α, M) :=
  Function.Injective.distribMulAction coeFnAddMonoidHom coe_injective coe_smul

variable [Semiring R] [AddCommMonoid M] [AddCommMonoid M₂]

variable [ContinuousAdd M] [Module R M] [ContinuousConstSMul R M]

variable [ContinuousAdd M₂] [Module R M₂] [ContinuousConstSMul R M₂]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Algebra/Variant93aa45e1eb9f475cd9abb73a3841fcd4483067507e9658f6f5bb51702ffb5474.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Algebra/Variant93aa45e1eb9f475cd9abb73a3841fcd4483067507e9658f6f5bb51702ffb5474.lean#L645).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `771d9f10602096033aaea54e48b2e114c0a6007c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
