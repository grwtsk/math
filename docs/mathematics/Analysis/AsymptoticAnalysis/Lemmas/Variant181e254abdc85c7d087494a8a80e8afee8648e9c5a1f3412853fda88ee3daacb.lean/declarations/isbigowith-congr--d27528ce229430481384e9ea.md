## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e7667eca-7c19-af1d-ebc2-b0db82174c21`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 694–705.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isBigOWith_congr (e : PartialHomeomorph α β) {b : β} (hb : b ∈ e.target) {f : β → E}
    {g : β → F} {C : ℝ} : IsBigOWith C (𝓝 b) f g ↔ IsBigOWith C (𝓝 (e.symm b)) (f ∘ e) (g ∘ e) :=
  ⟨fun h =>
    h.comp_tendsto <| by
      have := e.continuousAt (e.map_target hb)
      rwa [ContinuousAt, e.rightInvOn hb] at this,
    fun h =>
    (h.comp_tendsto (e.continuousAt_symm hb)).congr' rfl
      ((e.eventually_right_inverse hb).mono fun _ hx => congr_arg f hx)
      ((e.eventually_right_inverse hb).mono fun _ hx => congr_arg g hx)⟩

/-- Transfer `IsBigO` over a `PartialHomeomorph`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Lemmas/Variant181e254abdc85c7d087494a8a80e8afee8648e9c5a1f3412853fda88ee3daacb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Lemmas/Variant181e254abdc85c7d087494a8a80e8afee8648e9c5a1f3412853fda88ee3daacb.lean#L694).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8211ac997303c104dfd6961fa29e577f094c8094` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
