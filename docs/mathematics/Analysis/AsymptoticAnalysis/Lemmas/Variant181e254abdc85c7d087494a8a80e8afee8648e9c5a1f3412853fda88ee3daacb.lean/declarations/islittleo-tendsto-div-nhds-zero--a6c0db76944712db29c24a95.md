## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b07eab80-791b-dc47-b867-22397e4320b0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 359–366.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem IsLittleO.tendsto_div_nhds_zero {f g : α → 𝕜} (h : f =o[l] g) :
    Tendsto (fun x => f x / g x) l (𝓝 0) :=
  (isLittleO_one_iff 𝕜).mp <| by
    calc
      (fun x => f x / g x) =o[l] fun x => g x / g x := by
        simpa only [div_eq_mul_inv] using h.mul_isBigO (isBigO_refl _ _)
      _ =O[l] fun _x => (1 : 𝕜) := isBigO_of_le _ fun x => by simp [div_self_le_one]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Lemmas/Variant181e254abdc85c7d087494a8a80e8afee8648e9c5a1f3412853fda88ee3daacb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Lemmas/Variant181e254abdc85c7d087494a8a80e8afee8648e9c5a1f3412853fda88ee3daacb.lean#L359).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8211ac997303c104dfd6961fa29e577f094c8094` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
