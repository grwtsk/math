## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a901466c-e699-f909-2fc1-41652202f39f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 61–69.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma of_isBigO {f g : ℝ → ℝ} (h : f =O[atTop] g) (hg : ∀ᶠ T in atTop, 0 ≤ g T) :
    EvBound f g := by
  obtain ⟨C, hC, h⟩ := h.exists_pos
  rw [IsBigOWith] at h
  obtain ⟨T₀, hT₀⟩ := eventually_atTop.mp (h.and hg)
  refine ⟨C, hC, T₀, fun T hT => ?_⟩
  obtain ⟨h1, h2⟩ := hT₀ T hT
  simpa [Real.norm_eq_abs, abs_of_nonneg h2] using h1

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/PrimeSideB/Variant547396d688d87cf2b1e569b6f14e3da3c47d79c6a4b4a7b37532bd2766f2411c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/PrimeSideB/Variant547396d688d87cf2b1e569b6f14e3da3c47d79c6a4b4a7b37532bd2766f2411c.lean#L61).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1934960950af75446e27ed57e91a2883188050c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
