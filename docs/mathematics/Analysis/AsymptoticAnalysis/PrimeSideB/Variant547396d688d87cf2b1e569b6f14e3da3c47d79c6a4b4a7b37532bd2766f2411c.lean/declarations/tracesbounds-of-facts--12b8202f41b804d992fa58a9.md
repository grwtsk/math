## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3dcc4e17-c656-268b-2877-75abb4b173c3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 817–834.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tracesBounds_of_facts : TracesBounds P D.aT D.trG D.trG2 D.Ncnt where
  tr1 := tr1 h
  tr1' := tr1' h
  tr2 := tr2 h
  ratio := ratio h

end assembly

end PrimeSide

/-! ## §3.  [prop:PP]

Statement over `Mform` and `Defs.lean`'s `PX, PhiR, g`,
via the 𝒟 / 𝒪₁ / 𝒪₂ decomposition [eq:MPP]. -/

end Zeta23

end
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/PrimeSideB/Variant547396d688d87cf2b1e569b6f14e3da3c47d79c6a4b4a7b37532bd2766f2411c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/PrimeSideB/Variant547396d688d87cf2b1e569b6f14e3da3c47d79c6a4b4a7b37532bd2766f2411c.lean#L817).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d1934960950af75446e27ed57e91a2883188050c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
