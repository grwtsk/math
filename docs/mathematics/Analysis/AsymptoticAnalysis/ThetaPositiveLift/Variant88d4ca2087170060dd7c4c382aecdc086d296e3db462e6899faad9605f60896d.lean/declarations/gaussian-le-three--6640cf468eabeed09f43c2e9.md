## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2f7b2009-b15d-a206-47cc-6223c5f616ca`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 110–118.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem gaussian_le_three {A : ℝ} (hA : 3 ≤ A) (m : ℕ) :
    gaussianMode A m ≤ gaussianMode 3 m := by
  unfold gaussianMode
  apply mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left _ (by positivity)
  apply Real.exp_le_exp.mpr
  have hm : (0 : ℝ) ≤ m := Nat.cast_nonneg m
  nlinarith [mul_nonneg (sub_nonneg.mpr hA)
    (show 0 ≤ ((m : ℝ) + 2) ^ 2 - 1 by nlinarith)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/ThetaPositiveLift/Variant88d4ca2087170060dd7c4c382aecdc086d296e3db462e6899faad9605f60896d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/ThetaPositiveLift/Variant88d4ca2087170060dd7c4c382aecdc086d296e3db462e6899faad9605f60896d.lean#L110).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `839473362e74b673c214b0fb14370732e61032ea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
