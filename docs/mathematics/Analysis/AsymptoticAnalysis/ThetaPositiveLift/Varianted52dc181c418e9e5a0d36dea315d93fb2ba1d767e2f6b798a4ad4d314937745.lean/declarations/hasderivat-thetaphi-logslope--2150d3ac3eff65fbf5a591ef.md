## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0deeb6b6-1334-c33b-0d5d-1f90fc3f20cf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 295–302.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasDerivAt_thetaPhi_logSlope {t : ℝ} (ht : 0 ≤ t) :
    HasDerivAt (fun u : ℝ => deriv thetaPhi u / thetaPhi u)
      ((thetaPhiD2 t * thetaPhi t - thetaPhiD1 t * thetaPhiD1 t) / (thetaPhi t) ^ 2) t := by
  convert! (hasDerivAt_deriv_thetaPhi ht).div (hasDerivAt_thetaPhi ht)
    (thetaPhi_positive t ht).ne' using 1
  simp only [deriv_thetaPhi_eq_D1 ht]

/-- The logarithmic slope has strictly negative derivative on the half-line. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/ThetaPositiveLift/Varianted52dc181c418e9e5a0d36dea315d93fb2ba1d767e2f6b798a4ad4d314937745.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/ThetaPositiveLift/Varianted52dc181c418e9e5a0d36dea315d93fb2ba1d767e2f6b798a4ad4d314937745.lean#L295).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a751d462342e92a910edc8636fcd48f69f93bbd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
