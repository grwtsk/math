## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a1990716-4a99-f689-716a-9305d8becf02`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 333–341.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private lemma nhdsWithin_Ioi_le_nhdsWithin_uIcc :
    𝓝[Set.Ioi 0] (0 : ℝ) ≤ 𝓝[Set.uIcc 0 1] 0 := by
  rw [Set.uIcc_of_le zero_le_one,
    ← nhdsWithin_inter_of_mem
      (show Set.Iio (1 : ℝ) ∈ 𝓝[Set.Ioi 0] 0 from
        nhdsWithin_le_nhds (Iio_mem_nhds (by norm_num : (0:ℝ) < 1))),
    Set.inter_comm]
  exact nhdsWithin_mono 0 (fun x ⟨h1, h2⟩ => ⟨le_of_lt h1, le_of_lt h2⟩)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/LiSeries/Variant0ebd4538e079e4ec2eea8ca1e91a32ab71b1260de4640b928bb885e3bee7f795.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/LiSeries/Variant0ebd4538e079e4ec2eea8ca1e91a32ab71b1260de4640b928bb885e3bee7f795.lean#L333).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `89ef6f525685569b90716827903f2340987df587` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
