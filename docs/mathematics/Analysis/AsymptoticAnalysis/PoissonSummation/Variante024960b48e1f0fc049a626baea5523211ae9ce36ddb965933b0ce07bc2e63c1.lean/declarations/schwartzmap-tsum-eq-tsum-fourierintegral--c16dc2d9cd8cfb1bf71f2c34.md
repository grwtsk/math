## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ae5f4a19-e029-b52a-6509-69b30cc9acbd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 222–229.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem SchwartzMap.tsum_eq_tsum_fourierIntegral (f : SchwartzMap ℝ ℂ) (x : ℝ) :
    ∑' n : ℤ, f (x + n) = ∑' n : ℤ, fourierTransformCLM ℝ f n * fourier n (x : UnitAddCircle) := by
  -- We know that Schwartz functions are `O(‖x ^ (-b)‖)` for *every* `b`; for this argument we take
  -- `b = 2` and work with that.
  apply Real.tsum_eq_tsum_fourierIntegral_of_rpow_decay f.continuous one_lt_two
    (f.isBigO_cocompact_rpow (-2)) ((fourierTransformCLM ℝ f).isBigO_cocompact_rpow (-2))

end Schwartz
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/PoissonSummation/Variante024960b48e1f0fc049a626baea5523211ae9ce36ddb965933b0ce07bc2e63c1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/PoissonSummation/Variante024960b48e1f0fc049a626baea5523211ae9ce36ddb965933b0ce07bc2e63c1.lean#L222).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6181f9999b89fb90b0272db2278bcaa3e3d950fc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
