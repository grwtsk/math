## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:25ed49e5-1da6-2b08-38ff-ba4d197610c4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma dyadicShell_lower_bound {r0 x : ℝ} {k : ℕ} (hr0 : 0 < r0) (hx : r0 ≤ x)
    (hk : ⌊Real.logb 2 (x / r0)⌋₊ = k) :
    r0 * (2 : ℝ) ^ (k : ℝ) ≤ x := by
  have hr0ne : r0 ≠ 0 := ne_of_gt hr0
  have hx1 : (1 : ℝ) ≤ x / r0 := by
    have : r0 / r0 ≤ x / r0 := div_le_div_of_nonneg_right hx hr0.le
    simpa [hr0ne] using this
  have hle : (2 : ℝ) ^ (k : ℝ) ≤ x / r0 := by
    have := Real.two_pow_floor_logb_le (x := x / r0) hx1
    simpa [hk] using this
  have := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left hle hr0.le
  have hxEq : r0 * (x / r0) = x := by
    field_simp [hr0ne]
  simpa [mul_assoc, hxEq] using this

/-- If `k = ⌊log₂ (x / r₀)⌋`, then `x` is bounded by the next dyadic endpoint. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Dyadic/Varianteeeabf76ec18f4df163e7e1f286d5cd8eb3eba1a83ed8f6c7d355a6b8a3f19a8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Dyadic/Varianteeeabf76ec18f4df163e7e1f286d5cd8eb3eba1a83ed8f6c7d355a6b8a3f19a8.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b49a0582af90a227756a5766cfc8d87e5c0b507c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
