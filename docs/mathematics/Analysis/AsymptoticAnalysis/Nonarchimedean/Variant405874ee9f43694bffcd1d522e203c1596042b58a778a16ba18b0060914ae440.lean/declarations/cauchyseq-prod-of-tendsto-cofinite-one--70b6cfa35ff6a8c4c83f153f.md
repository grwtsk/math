## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9aaedcae-5708-3202-41c8-3637d8c865ea`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 47–70.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem cauchySeq_prod_of_tendsto_cofinite_one {f : α → G} (hf : Tendsto f cofinite (𝓝 1)) :
    CauchySeq (fun s ↦ ∏ i ∈ s, f i) := by
  /- Let `U` be a neighborhood of `1`. It suffices to show that there exists `s : Finset α` such
  that for any `t : Finset α` disjoint from `s`, we have `∏ i ∈ t, f i ∈ U`. -/

  -- Since `G` is nonarchimedean, `U` contains an open subgroup `V`.
  rcases is_nonarchimedean U hU with ⟨V, hV⟩
  /- Let `s` be the set of all indices `i : α` such that `f i ∉ V`. By our assumption `hf`, this is
  finite. -/
  use (tendsto_def.mp hf V V.mem_nhds_one).toFinset
  /- For any `t : Finset α` disjoint from `s`, the product `∏ i ∈ t, f i` is a product of elements
  of `V`, so it is an element of `V` too. Thus, `∏ i ∈ t, f i ∈ U`, as desired. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Nonarchimedean/Variant405874ee9f43694bffcd1d522e203c1596042b58a778a16ba18b0060914ae440.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Nonarchimedean/Variant405874ee9f43694bffcd1d522e203c1596042b58a778a16ba18b0060914ae440.lean#L47).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `906517a532b90b4a33ebcc11e83483af1bd05c90` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
