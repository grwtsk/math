## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dee6adfc-75a8-5b87-ac2b-46b5b0fd7663`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 523–547.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  (title := "$1/y^2$ decay of $\\Re F$ on a vertical strip")
  (statement := /-- Under the hypotheses of \ref{kadiri-prop-2-1}: for every closed vertical
  strip $\sigma_0 \leq \Re s \leq \sigma_1$ there is a constant
  $C = C(\sigma_0, \sigma_1, f)$ such that for every $s \in \mathbb{C}$ with
  $\sigma_0 \leq \Re s \leq \sigma_1$ and $|\Im s| \geq 1$,
  $$ |\Re F(s)| \leq \frac{C}{(\Im s)^2}. $$
  Note that this is sharper than the elementary $|F(s)| = O(1/|s|)$ from a single integration
  by parts: the cancellation $\Re(1/s) = \sigma/(\sigma^2 + y^2) = O(1/y^2)$ for bounded
  $\sigma$ saves one power of $|y|$ once the real part is taken. -/)
  (proof := /-- Apply \ref{kadiri-laplace-ibp} to get
  $F(s) = f(0)/s + F_2(s)/s^2$, where $F_2$ is the Laplace transform of $f''$. Taking real
  parts at $s = \sigma + iy$:
  $\Re F(s) = \dfrac{f(0)\, \sigma}{\sigma^2 + y^2}
              + \Re \dfrac{F_2(s)}{s^2}$. The first summand is bounded by
  $|f(0)| \cdot \max(|\sigma_0|, |\sigma_1|) / y^2$; the second by absolute values is at most
  $\dfrac{1}{y^2} \cdot d \cdot \max(1, e^{-\sigma_0 d}) \cdot \|f''\|_\infty$ (using
  $\mathrm{supp}\, f'' \subseteq [0, d]$). Both depend only on $\sigma_0, \sigma_1, d, f$;
  take $C$ to be their sum. To be formalised. -/)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Kadiri/Variantec4a0c436037d0d21eeac8b92b3059f8d3301f468f8c28e00a299a646818cfb8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Kadiri/Variantec4a0c436037d0d21eeac8b92b3059f8d3301f468f8c28e00a299a646818cfb8.lean#L523).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6326567f538c80e40d2edd733922ee69b10b823a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
