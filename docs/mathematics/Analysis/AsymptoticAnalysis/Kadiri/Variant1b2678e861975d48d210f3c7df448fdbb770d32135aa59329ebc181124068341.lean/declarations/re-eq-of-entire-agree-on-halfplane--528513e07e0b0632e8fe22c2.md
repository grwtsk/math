## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2a4db705-92cc-5be7-e28d-ad161602c172`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 182–208.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! ## Auxiliaries glueing the four precursors to Proposition 2.1

Two facts not in the four precursors above are needed: \ref{kadiri-re-hadamardB-eq} (the
closed form $\Re B = -\sum_\rho \Re(1/\rho)$, conjectured from the Hadamard product) and
\ref{kadiri-summable-lap-at-zeros} (summability of the residue sum at the non-trivial zeros).
They combine with \ref{kadiri-hadamard-identity} and \ref{kadiri-re-agree-extension} to give
\ref{kadiri-re-inner-eq} (collapsing the $f(0)$-coefficient of equation (16) into the
$T_1$ form). After that, \ref{kadiri-prop-2-1} is a two-line `rw` chain. All three are
stated below with `sorry` proofs. -/

@[blueprint
  "kadiri-re-hadamardB-eq"
  (title := "Real part of the Hadamard constant")
  (statement := /-- $\Re B = -\sum_{\rho \in Z(\zeta)} \Re \tfrac{1}{\rho}$, where $B$ is the
  Hadamard constant (\ref{kadiri-hadamard-B}). -/)
  (proof := /-- Subtract $\tfrac{1}{s-1}$ from \ref{kadiri-hadamard-identity}, take $s \to 1$
  using the Laurent expansion $-\zeta'/\zeta(s) = \tfrac{1}{s-1} - \gamma + O(s - 1)$ near $s = 1$
  and the value $\Gamma'/\Gamma(3/2)$, then symmetrise the resulting sum
  $\sum_\rho (1/\rho + 1/(1-\rho))$ using $\rho \leftrightarrow 1 - \bar\rho$ to relate
  $\sum_\rho 1/\rho$ to $\Re B$. To be formalised. -/)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Kadiri/Variant1b2678e861975d48d210f3c7df448fdbb770d32135aa59329ebc181124068341.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Kadiri/Variant1b2678e861975d48d210f3c7df448fdbb770d32135aa59329ebc181124068341.lean#L182).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `caefc881fdabcfb3983ca23715e9283f54ac4f11` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
