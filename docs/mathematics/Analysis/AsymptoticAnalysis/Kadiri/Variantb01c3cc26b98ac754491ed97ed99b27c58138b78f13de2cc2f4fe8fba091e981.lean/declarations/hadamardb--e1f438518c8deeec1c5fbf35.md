## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:54b99d7b4b5ce8c2be9bd4c9fe748f7f4fbe5e01d3e98f425c806c923e59acdc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–107.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def hadamardB : ℂ := sorry

@[blueprint
  "kadiri-hadamard-identity"
  (title := "Hadamard expansion of $-\\zeta'/\\zeta$ (after equation (16))")
  (statement := /-- For every $s \in \mathbb{C}$ that is neither $1$ nor a non-trivial zero
  of $\zeta$,
  $$ -\frac{\zeta'}{\zeta}(s) = -B - \tfrac{1}{2} \log \pi + \frac{1}{s - 1}
       + \tfrac{1}{2} \frac{\Gamma'}{\Gamma}\!\left(\tfrac{s}{2} + 1\right)
       - \sum_{\rho \in Z(\zeta)} \left(\frac{1}{\rho} + \frac{1}{s - \rho}\right), $$
  where $B$ is the Hadamard constant (\ref{kadiri-hadamard-B}). This is the logarithmic
  derivative of the Hadamard factorisation of $\zeta$
  (\cite[Chapter 12]{Davenport2000}). -/)
  (proof := /-- Differentiate the Hadamard product (\ref{kadiri-hadamard-B}) logarithmically;
  the linear-in-$s$ term in the exponential collapses to the constant $B$. The
  $\tfrac{1}{s-1}$ term comes from the $(s-1)\zeta(s)$ prefactor and the
  $\tfrac{1}{2} \Gamma'/\Gamma$ term from the gamma factor. To be formalised. -/)
  (latexEnv := "lemma")
  (discussion := 1474)]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Kadiri/Variantb01c3cc26b98ac754491ed97ed99b27c58138b78f13de2cc2f4fe8fba091e981.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Kadiri/Variantb01c3cc26b98ac754491ed97ed99b27c58138b78f13de2cc2f4fe8fba091e981.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5097a000f84401155f4f06bd32e60018848d6b57` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
