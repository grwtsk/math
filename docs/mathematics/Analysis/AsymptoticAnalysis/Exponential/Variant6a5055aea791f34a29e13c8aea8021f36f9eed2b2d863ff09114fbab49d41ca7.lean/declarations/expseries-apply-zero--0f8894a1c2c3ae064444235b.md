## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a13e4a1a-790e-6207-f65d-280506abe98c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 147–154.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem expSeries_apply_zero (n : ℕ) :
    expSeries 𝕂 𝔸 n (fun _ => (0 : 𝔸)) = Pi.single (M := fun _ => 𝔸) 0 1 n := by
  rw [expSeries_apply_eq]
  rcases n with - | n
  · rw [pow_zero, Nat.factorial_zero, Nat.cast_one, inv_one, one_smul, Pi.single_eq_same]
  · rw [zero_pow (Nat.succ_ne_zero _), smul_zero, Pi.single_eq_of_ne n.succ_ne_zero]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Exponential/Variant6a5055aea791f34a29e13c8aea8021f36f9eed2b2d863ff09114fbab49d41ca7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Exponential/Variant6a5055aea791f34a29e13c8aea8021f36f9eed2b2d863ff09114fbab49d41ca7.lean#L147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `65f7c16954d7fea763fb38e78bce65ccf371540d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
