## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:570c8171-e332-5e7f-a822-e2a61ddb2e01`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 171–190.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem compContinuousLinearMap_applyComposition {n : ℕ} (p : FormalMultilinearSeries 𝕜 F G)
    (f : E →L[𝕜] F) (c : Composition n) (v : Fin n → E) :
    (p.compContinuousLinearMap f).applyComposition c v = p.applyComposition c (f ∘ v) := by
  simp [applyComposition]; rfl
#align formal_multilinear_series.comp_continuous_linear_map_apply_composition FormalMultilinearSeries.compContinuousLinearMap_applyComposition

end FormalMultilinearSeries

namespace ContinuousMultilinearMap

open FormalMultilinearSeries

variable [TopologicalAddGroup E] [ContinuousConstSMul 𝕜 E]

variable [TopologicalAddGroup F] [ContinuousConstSMul 𝕜 F]

/-- Given a formal multilinear series `p`, a composition `c` of `n` and a continuous multilinear
map `f` in `c.length` variables, one may form a continuous multilinear map in `n` variables by
applying the right coefficient of `p` to each block of the composition, and then applying `f` to
the resulting vector. It is called `f.comp_along_composition p c`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Composition/Variante8a59fe40ca310e19240284e1e6b7a035d1ea8a1fd4c82b66aa7905ac7f4058c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Composition/Variante8a59fe40ca310e19240284e1e6b7a035d1ea8a1fd4c82b66aa7905ac7f4058c.lean#L171).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a4665617df85c93782d95a058754fdcdb8334583` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
