## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a963b91a4658f71cff02b4b356318ac9cde6c7ee31fd2e311248c58bb047d5b6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 612–615.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def compPartialSumTargetSet (m M N : ℕ) : Set (Σ n, Composition n) :=
  {i | m ≤ i.2.length ∧ i.2.length < M ∧ ∀ j : Fin i.2.length, i.2.blocksFun j < N}
#align formal_multilinear_series.comp_partial_sum_target_set FormalMultilinearSeries.compPartialSumTargetSet

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Composition/Variante8a59fe40ca310e19240284e1e6b7a035d1ea8a1fd4c82b66aa7905ac7f4058c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Composition/Variante8a59fe40ca310e19240284e1e6b7a035d1ea8a1fd4c82b66aa7905ac7f4058c.lean#L612).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a4665617df85c93782d95a058754fdcdb8334583` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
