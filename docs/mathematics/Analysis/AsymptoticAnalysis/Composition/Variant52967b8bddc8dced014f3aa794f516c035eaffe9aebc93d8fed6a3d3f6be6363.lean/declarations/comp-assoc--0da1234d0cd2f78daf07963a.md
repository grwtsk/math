## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c2f7ca21-4eff-477d-9a33-d42d62db3464`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1192–1233.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  /- First, rewrite the two compositions appearing in the theorem as two sums over complicated
    sigma types, as in the description of the proof above. -/
  let f : (Σ a : Composition n, Composition a.length) → H := fun c =>
    r c.2.length (applyComposition q c.2 (applyComposition p c.1 v))
  let g : (Σ c : Composition n, ∀ i : Fin c.length, Composition (c.blocksFun i)) → H := fun c =>
    r c.1.length fun i : Fin c.1.length =>
      q (c.2 i).length (applyComposition p (c.2 i) (v ∘ c.1.embedding i))

  /- To check that we have the same terms, we should check that we apply the same component of
    `r`, and the same component of `q`, and the same component of `p`, to the same coordinate of
    `v`. This is true by definition, but at each step one needs to convince Lean that the types
    one considers are the same, using a suitable congruence lemma to avoid dependent type issues.
    This dance has to be done three times, one for `r`, one for `q` and one for `p`.-/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Composition/Variant52967b8bddc8dced014f3aa794f516c035eaffe9aebc93d8fed6a3d3f6be6363.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/Composition/Variant52967b8bddc8dced014f3aa794f516c035eaffe9aebc93d8fed6a3d3f6be6363.lean#L1192).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
