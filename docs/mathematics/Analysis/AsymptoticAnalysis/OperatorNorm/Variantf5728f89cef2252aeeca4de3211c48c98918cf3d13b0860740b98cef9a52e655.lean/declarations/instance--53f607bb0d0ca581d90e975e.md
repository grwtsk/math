## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:58abbbd65835760c32235770e9e23da723f3fb4758a93100b0bac906938dbc3b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1612–1631.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [CompleteSpace F] : CompleteSpace (E' →SL[σ₁₂] F) := by
  -- We show that every Cauchy sequence converges.
  refine' Metric.complete_of_cauchySeq_tendsto fun f hf => _
  -- The evaluation at any point `v : E` is Cauchy.
  have cau : ∀ v, CauchySeq fun n => f n v := fun v => hf.map (lipschitz_apply v).uniformContinuous
  -- We assemble the limits points of those Cauchy sequences
  -- (which exist as `F` is complete)
  -- into a function which we call `G`.
  choose G hG using fun v => cauchySeq_tendsto_of_complete (cau v)
  -- Next, we show that this `G` is a continuous linear map.
  -- This is done in `ContinuousLinearMap.ofTendstoOfBoundedRange`.
  set Glin : E' →SL[σ₁₂] F :=
    ofTendstoOfBoundedRange _ _ (tendsto_pi_nhds.mpr hG) hf.bounded_range
  -- Finally, `f n` converges to `Glin` in norm because of
  -- `ContinuousLinearMap.tendsto_of_tendsto_pointwise_of_cauchySeq`
  exact ⟨Glin, tendsto_of_tendsto_pointwise_of_cauchySeq (tendsto_pi_nhds.2 hG) hf⟩

/-- Let `s` be a bounded set in the space of continuous (semi)linear maps `E →SL[σ] F` taking values
in a proper space. Then `s` interpreted as a set in the space of maps `E → F` with topology of
pointwise convergence is precompact: its closure is a compact set. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/OperatorNorm/Variantf5728f89cef2252aeeca4de3211c48c98918cf3d13b0860740b98cef9a52e655.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/OperatorNorm/Variantf5728f89cef2252aeeca4de3211c48c98918cf3d13b0860740b98cef9a52e655.lean#L1612).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a86695945e4c66640b661f94d3ce85955fba3bf0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
