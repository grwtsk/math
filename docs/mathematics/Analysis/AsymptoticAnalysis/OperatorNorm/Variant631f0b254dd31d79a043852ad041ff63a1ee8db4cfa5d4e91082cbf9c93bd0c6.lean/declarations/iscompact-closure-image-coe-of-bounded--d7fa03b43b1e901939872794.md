## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c735b257-49d8-90cd-08e2-05b44e0dc5f2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1640–1652.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem isCompact_closure_image_coe_of_bounded [ProperSpace F] {s : Set (E' →SL[σ₁₂] F)}
    (hb : Bounded s) : IsCompact (closure (((↑) : (E' →SL[σ₁₂] F) → E' → F) '' s)) :=
  have : ∀ x, IsCompact (closure (apply' F σ₁₂ x '' s)) := fun x =>
    ((apply' F σ₁₂ x).lipschitz.bounded_image hb).isCompact_closure

#align continuous_linear_map.is_compact_closure_image_coe_of_bounded ContinuousLinearMap.isCompact_closure_image_coe_of_bounded

/-- Let `s` be a bounded set in the space of continuous (semi)linear maps `E →SL[σ] F` taking values
in a proper space. If `s` interpreted as a set in the space of maps `E → F` with topology of
pointwise convergence is closed, then it is compact.

TODO: reformulate this in terms of a type synonym with the right topology. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/OperatorNorm/Variant631f0b254dd31d79a043852ad041ff63a1ee8db4cfa5d4e91082cbf9c93bd0c6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/OperatorNorm/Variant631f0b254dd31d79a043852ad041ff63a1ee8db4cfa5d4e91082cbf9c93bd0c6.lean#L1640).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d430a4d0f26a7ca7e607d1c5349583e2d4936119` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
