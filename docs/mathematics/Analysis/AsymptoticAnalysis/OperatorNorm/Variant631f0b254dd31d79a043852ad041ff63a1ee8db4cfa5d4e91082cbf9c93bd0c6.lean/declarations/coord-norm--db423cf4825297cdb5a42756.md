## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8432c3cd-21b6-4871-b824-60f263b728a7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 2018–2033.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coord_norm (x : E) (h : x ≠ 0) : ‖coord 𝕜 x h‖ = ‖x‖⁻¹ := by
  have hx : 0 < ‖x‖ := norm_pos_iff.mpr h
  haveI : Nontrivial (𝕜 ∙ x) := Submodule.nontrivial_span_singleton h
  exact ContinuousLinearMap.homothety_norm _ fun y =>
    homothety_inverse _ hx _ (toSpanNonzeroSingleton_homothety 𝕜 x h) _
#align continuous_linear_equiv.coord_norm ContinuousLinearEquiv.coord_norm

end

end ContinuousLinearEquiv

end Normed

/-- A bounded bilinear form `B` in a real normed space is *coercive*
if there is some positive constant C such that `C * ‖u‖ * ‖u‖ ≤ B u u`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/OperatorNorm/Variant631f0b254dd31d79a043852ad041ff63a1ee8db4cfa5d4e91082cbf9c93bd0c6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AsymptoticAnalysis/OperatorNorm/Variant631f0b254dd31d79a043852ad041ff63a1ee8db4cfa5d4e91082cbf9c93bd0c6.lean#L2018).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d430a4d0f26a7ca7e607d1c5349583e2d4936119` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
