## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6b53da2e147fe03cbc18b1c462bd5e8d1369a2f8f84041c80739fdd7edb55871`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 86–113.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure MellinLogDerivativeSquare
    {q : ℕ} [NeZero q] (χ : DirichletCharacter ℂ q) where
  mellin : ℂ → ℂ
  regularizedL : ℂ → ℂ

  mellin_eq_centeredIntegral :
    ∀ s, mellin s = centeredTwistedPsiMellin χ s

  regularizedL_differentiable : Differentiable ℂ regularizedL

  regularizedL_zero_iff_LFunction_zero :
    ∀ s : ℂ, 0 < s.re → s.re < 1 →
      (regularizedL s = 0 ↔ DirichletCharacter.LFunction χ s = 0)

  regularizedL_ne_zero_of_one_lt_re :
    ∀ s : ℂ, 1 < s.re → regularizedL s ≠ 0

  mellin_differentiableOn :
    CenteredTwistedPsiHalfPlusEpsilon χ →
      DifferentiableOn ℂ mellin criticalRightHalfPlane

  regularizedLogDerivativeIdentity :
    ∀ s : ℂ, 1 < s.re →
      mellin s + dirichletPrincipalIndicator χ =
        -deriv regularizedL s / regularizedL s

/-- Holomorphic ODE residual for the regularized `L`-function. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/MellinLogDerivative/Variantbf5ccf78ab3ffce5d2d9327bb7d7a71ce69bc9359031408d3351182662d9c27c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MellinLogDerivative/Variantbf5ccf78ab3ffce5d2d9327bb7d7a71ce69bc9359031408d3351182662d9c27c.lean#L86).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5ad20deb7be8627218d474dbd128ee8fb404071a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
