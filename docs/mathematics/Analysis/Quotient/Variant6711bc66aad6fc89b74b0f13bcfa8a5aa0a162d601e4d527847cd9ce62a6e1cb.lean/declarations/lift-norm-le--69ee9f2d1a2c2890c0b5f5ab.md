## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c8b595cc-f873-5f43-66a4-af7c5aa58a67`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 462–466.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lift_norm_le {N : Type*} [SeminormedAddCommGroup N] (S : AddSubgroup M)
    (f : NormedAddGroupHom M N) (hf : ∀ s ∈ S, f s = 0) {c : ℝ≥0} (fb : ‖f‖ ≤ c) :
    ‖lift S f hf‖ ≤ c :=
  (norm_lift_le S f hf).trans fb

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Quotient/Variant6711bc66aad6fc89b74b0f13bcfa8a5aa0a162d601e4d527847cd9ce62a6e1cb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Quotient/Variant6711bc66aad6fc89b74b0f13bcfa8a5aa0a162d601e4d527847cd9ce62a6e1cb.lean#L462).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `524c4e9c40ee4d9adea543f941a42bbd3e9c5bc7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
