## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bc64cf38-3c17-2295-54de-ea6daeee38bd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 55–64.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private lemma log_trailingCoeff_eq_zero_on_unitSphere {a : ℂ} (h : 0 < meromorphicOrderAt f 0)
    (ha : a ∈ sphere 0 |1|) :
    log ‖meromorphicTrailingCoeffAt (f · - a) 0‖ = 0 := by
  simp_rw [sub_eq_neg_add]
  rw [(meromorphicAt_of_meromorphicOrderAt_ne_zero
    h.ne').meromorphicTrailingCoeffAt_fun_add_eq_left_of_lt]
  · aesop
  · rw [meromorphicOrderAt_const]
    aesop

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Cartan/Variant7f38d1a4e10b06b1786a08a1fe15d6eb4c92955e4560cea2aef23a19457750bb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Cartan/Variant7f38d1a4e10b06b1786a08a1fe15d6eb4c92955e4560cea2aef23a19457750bb.lean#L55).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `36ee2a1730aa25f0640153e8a4b6e7c917b7b412` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
