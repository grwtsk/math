## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c197cf0-8ad6-c23b-7161-e947b9598b22`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 149–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem check_sound {family : List Member} {a b : ℚ} {tr : Trace}
    (h : check family a b tr = true) :
    ‖centerSum family a b - toComplex (output family tr)‖ ≤ (error family a b tr : ℝ) := by
  obtain ⟨_, _, _, _, hs, hacc⟩ := (check_iff_valid family a b tr).mp h
  have hf := centerSum_error (fun i hi => (hs i hi).2.2)
  have ha := RationalFiniteSum.check_sound hacc
  simp only [length_terms] at ha
  let Q : ℂ := ∑ i ∈ Finset.range family.length,
    toComplex (RationalFiniteSum.termAt (terms family tr.evaluations) i)
  calc
    _ = ‖(centerSum family a b - Q) + (Q - toComplex (output family tr))‖ := by
      congr 1; abel
    _ ≤ ‖centerSum family a b - Q‖ + ‖Q - toComplex (output family tr)‖ := norm_add_le _ _
    _ ≤ (error family a b tr : ℝ) := by
      simpa only [error, Rat.cast_add, output] using add_le_add hf ha

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/RationalMellinFamily.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Complex/RationalMellinFamily.lean#L149).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac85b66a4cc2134280684f95db7dd1f23f123577` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
