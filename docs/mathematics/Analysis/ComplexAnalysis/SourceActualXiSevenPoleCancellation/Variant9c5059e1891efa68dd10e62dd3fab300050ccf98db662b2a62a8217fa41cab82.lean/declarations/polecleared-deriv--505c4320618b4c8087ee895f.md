## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c9162d45-c394-a53e-716b-d856539e671b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–123.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem poleCleared_deriv {s : ℂ} (hs0 : s ≠ 0) (hs1 : s ≠ 1) :
    deriv actualZetaPoleCleared s = riemannZeta s + (s - 1) * deriv riemannZeta s := by
  have he : actualZetaPoleCleared =ᶠ[𝓝 s] (fun s => (s - 1) * riemannZeta s) := by

  simpa only [Pi.mul_apply, sub_zero, one_mul] using! hd.deriv

/-- The logarithmic derivative removes its genuine pole with the explicit actual nonzero guard. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/SourceActualXiSevenPoleCancellation/Variant9c5059e1891efa68dd10e62dd3fab300050ccf98db662b2a62a8217fa41cab82.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/SourceActualXiSevenPoleCancellation/Variant9c5059e1891efa68dd10e62dd3fab300050ccf98db662b2a62a8217fa41cab82.lean#L113).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5728611f461a3f76867032adbd2ab5657bb308ac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
