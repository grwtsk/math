## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:694d34c7-52b0-068a-ade6-dedddd70d098`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 375–391.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem circleRieszCandidate_sub
    (A B : H →L[ℂ] H) (c : ℂ) {r : ℝ} (hr : 0 ≤ r)
    (hA : Metric.sphere c r ⊆ resolventSet ℂ A)
    (hB : Metric.sphere c r ⊆ resolventSet ℂ B) :
    circleRieszCandidate B c r - circleRieszCandidate A c r =
      normalizedCircleIntegral (fun z ↦ resolvent B z - resolvent A z) c r := by

  have hiB := circleIntegrable_resolvent_of_sphere_subset_resolventSet B c hr hB

/--
Contour-integrated perturbation estimate.  It has the expected two resolvent
factors and therefore does not by itself collapse to a sharp Davis--Kahan
`1 / gap` constant.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/RieszCircle/Variant259e6a95156bd807f4a96cf47f8f939fa19c8a9e70fcb2dbf1721c3e30611631.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/RieszCircle/Variant259e6a95156bd807f4a96cf47f8f939fa19c8a9e70fcb2dbf1721c3e30611631.lean#L375).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `995961d12505855c4baca56268cdd0f66f115992` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
