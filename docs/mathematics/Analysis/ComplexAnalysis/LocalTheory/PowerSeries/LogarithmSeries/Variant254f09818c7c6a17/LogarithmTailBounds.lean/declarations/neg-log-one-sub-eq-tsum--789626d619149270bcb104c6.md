## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e32943d7-96de-027c-14e1-63ce316cad60`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 50–57.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma neg_log_one_sub_eq_tsum {z : ℂ} (hz : ‖z‖ < 1) :
    -log (1 - z) = ∑' n : ℕ, z ^ (n + 1) / (n + 1) := by
  have h := hasSum_taylorSeries_neg_log hz
  rw [← h.tsum_eq, h.summable.tsum_eq_zero_add]
  simp only [pow_zero, Nat.cast_zero, div_zero, zero_add, Nat.cast_add, Nat.cast_one]

/-- The tail `∑_{k>m} z^k / k`, as `∑' k, z^(m+1+k)/(m+1+k)`. -/
noncomputable
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/LocalTheory/PowerSeries/LogarithmSeries/Variant254f09818c7c6a17/LogarithmTailBounds.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/LocalTheory/PowerSeries/LogarithmSeries/Variant254f09818c7c6a17/LogarithmTailBounds.lean#L50).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c7585042bfd8a2757d6225251deb7feab915045` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
