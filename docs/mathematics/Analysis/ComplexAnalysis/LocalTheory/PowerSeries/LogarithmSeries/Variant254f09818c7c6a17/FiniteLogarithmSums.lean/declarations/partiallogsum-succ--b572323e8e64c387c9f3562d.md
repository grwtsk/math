## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e82c3f60-5b3f-11ea-0d3e-f080f362c6dc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 76–82.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma partialLogSum_succ (m : ℕ) :
    partialLogSum (m + 1) = partialLogSum m + (fun z : ℂ ↦ z ^ (m + 1) / (m + 1)) := by
  funext z
  simpa [partialLogSum, sub_eq_add_neg, add_comm, add_left_comm, add_assoc] using
    congrArg Neg.neg (logTaylor_succ_neg (m + 1) z)

/-- Evaluate `logTaylor` at `-z` as a finite positive-coefficient logarithm sum. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/LocalTheory/PowerSeries/LogarithmSeries/Variant254f09818c7c6a17/FiniteLogarithmSums.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/LocalTheory/PowerSeries/LogarithmSeries/Variant254f09818c7c6a17/FiniteLogarithmSums.lean#L76).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c2e8f24b71dc5e11d369cc983a9748814d226329` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
