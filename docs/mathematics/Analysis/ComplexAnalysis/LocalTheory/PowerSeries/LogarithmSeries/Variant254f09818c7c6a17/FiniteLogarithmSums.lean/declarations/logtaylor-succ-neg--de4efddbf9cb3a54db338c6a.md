## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:50098780-1b8c-7157-0118-ad0da454292c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 59–75.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma logTaylor_succ_neg (n : ℕ) (z : ℂ) :
    logTaylor (n + 1) (-z) = logTaylor n (-z) - z ^ n / n := by
  rw [logTaylor_succ, Pi.add_apply]
  have hsign : (-1 : ℂ) ^ (n + 1) * (-z) ^ n = -z ^ n := by
    have hzpow : (-z) ^ n = (((-1 : ℂ) * z) ^ n) := by simp
    rw [hzpow, mul_pow, ← mul_assoc, ← pow_add]
    have hpow : (-1 : ℂ) ^ (n + 1 + n) = (-1 : ℂ) := by
      rw [show n + 1 + n = 2 * n + 1 by omega, pow_add, pow_mul]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/LocalTheory/PowerSeries/LogarithmSeries/Variant254f09818c7c6a17/FiniteLogarithmSums.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/LocalTheory/PowerSeries/LogarithmSeries/Variant254f09818c7c6a17/FiniteLogarithmSums.lean#L59).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c2e8f24b71dc5e11d369cc983a9748814d226329` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
