## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e52dbcd9-e984-64c2-dac2-642b0b0ad773`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 129–140.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private theorem closedHead_analyticAt (s : ℂ) :
    AnalyticAt ℂ actualClosedMangoldtMellinHeadSeven s := by
  unfold actualClosedMangoldtMellinHeadSeven
  apply Finset.analyticAt_fun_sum
  intro n _
  rcases eq_or_ne n 0 with rfl | hn
  · simp only [ArithmeticFunction.map_zero, ofReal_zero, CharP.cast_eq_zero, zero_mul]
    exact analyticAt_const
  · simp_rw [cpow_def_of_ne_zero (by exact_mod_cast hn : (n : ℂ) ≠ 0)]
    fun_prop

/-- The full return has its exact local analytic regularization, with every source head retained. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Attempt06/Variante1d6330e29e7d51d7cd99367ff8d837e30bc5deeca2d6e1b40cc4c8691f5b6c0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Attempt06/Variante1d6330e29e7d51d7cd99367ff8d837e30bc5deeca2d6e1b40cc4c8691f5b6c0.lean#L129).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a7da48439e505516d7089c69e59edb2f6480adb4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
