## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f5ca1b8d-3473-5207-853d-d9c7f11ffc78`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 904–910.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma AnalyticOnNhd.comp_analyticOn {f : F → G} {g : E → F} {s : Set F}
    {t : Set E} (hf : AnalyticOnNhd 𝕜 f s) (hg : AnalyticOn 𝕜 g t) (h : Set.MapsTo g t s) :
    AnalyticOn 𝕜 (f ∘ g) t :=
  fun x m ↦ (hf _ (h m)).comp_analyticWithinAt (hg x m)

/-- If two functions `g` and `f` have finite power series `q` and `p` respectively at `f x` and `x`,
then `g ∘ f` admits the finite power series `q.comp p` at `x`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Composition/Variantccf497429bbbe807ab39c2550347b928ed2aa8e168bf00f01a8a46600b8776dc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Composition/Variantccf497429bbbe807ab39c2550347b928ed2aa8e168bf00f01a8a46600b8776dc.lean#L904).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f388cfd9353f6f9184359ea4859d0e85e95fe225` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
