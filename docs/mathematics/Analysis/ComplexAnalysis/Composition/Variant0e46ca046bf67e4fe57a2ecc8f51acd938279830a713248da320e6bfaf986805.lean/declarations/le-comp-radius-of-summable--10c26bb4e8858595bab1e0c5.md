## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:9d29e9be-ec87-4192-368e-d0af1ed053aa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 505–536.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Composing analytic functions

Now, we will prove that the composition of the partial sums of `q` and `p` up to order `N` is
given by a sum over some large subset of `Σ n, Composition n` of `q.compAlongComposition p`, to
deduce that the series for `q.comp p` indeed converges to `g ∘ f` when `q` is a power series for
`g` and `p` is a power series for `f`.

This proof is a big reindexing argument of a sum. Since it is a bit involved, we define first
the source of the change of variables (`compPartialSumSource`), its target
(`compPartialSumTarget`) and the change of variables itself (`compChangeOfVariables`) before
giving the main statement in `comp_partialSum`. -/


/-- Source set in the change of variables to compute the composition of partial sums of formal
power series.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Composition/Variant0e46ca046bf67e4fe57a2ecc8f51acd938279830a713248da320e6bfaf986805.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Composition/Variant0e46ca046bf67e4fe57a2ecc8f51acd938279830a713248da320e6bfaf986805.lean#L505).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3079cda7c5ddc4afcc2dc642adb0e9f39922c0c8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
