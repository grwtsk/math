## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:023619f3-0656-951f-4cdb-4c8caa80b675`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1038–1066.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  refine ⟨fun H => by rw [H], fun H => ?_⟩

      map List.sum (ofFn fun i : Fin (Composition.length a) => (b i).blocks) =
        map List.sum (ofFn fun i : Fin (Composition.length a') => (b' i).blocks) := by
      rw [H]
    simp only [map_ofFn] at this
    change
      (ofFn fun i : Fin (Composition.length a) => (b i).blocks.sum) =
        ofFn fun i : Fin (Composition.length a') => (b' i).blocks.sum at this

  · simp only [heq_eq_eq, ofFn_inj] at H ⊢
    ext1 i
    ext1
    exact congrFun H i

/-- When `a` is a composition of `n` and `b` is a composition of `a.length`, `a.gather b` is the
composition of `n` obtained by gathering all the blocks of `a` corresponding to a block of `b`.
For instance, if `a = [6, 5, 3, 5, 2]` and `b = [2, 3]`, one should gather together
the first two blocks of `a` and its last three blocks, giving `a.gather b = [11, 10]`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Composition/Variant46d7fe5169cb434fdf1662c01a4e71a5f0a95b27dfd6ad6766216f0e104ca33e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Composition/Variant46d7fe5169cb434fdf1662c01a4e71a5f0a95b27dfd6ad6766216f0e104ca33e.lean#L1038).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `539448fec4e14ce543b9f5e5d56e773329b4f6d6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
