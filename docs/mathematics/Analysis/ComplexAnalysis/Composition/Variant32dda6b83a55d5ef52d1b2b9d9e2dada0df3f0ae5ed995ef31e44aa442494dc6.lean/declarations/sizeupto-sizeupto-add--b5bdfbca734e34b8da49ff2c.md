## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2fd2c6ea-174b-4fcb-5b69-b09d764cb7f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1063–1115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Natural equivalence between `(Σ (a : Composition n), Composition a.length)` and
`(Σ (c : Composition n), Π (i : Fin c.length), Composition (c.blocksFun i))`, that shows up as a
change of variables in the proof that composition of formal multilinear series is associative.

Consider a composition `a` of `n` and a composition `b` of `a.length`. Then `b` indicates how to
group together some blocks of `a`, giving altogether `b.length` blocks of blocks. These blocks of
blocks can be called `d₀, ..., d_{a.length - 1}`, and one obtains a composition `c` of `n` by
saying that each `dᵢ` is one single block. The map `⟨a, b⟩ → ⟨c, (d₀, ..., d_{a.length - 1})⟩` is
the direct map in the equiv.

Conversely, if one starts from `c` and the `dᵢ`s, one can join the `dᵢ`s to obtain a composition
`a` of `n`, and register the lengths of the `dᵢ`s in a composition `b` of `a.length`. This is the
inverse map of the equiv.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Composition/Variant32dda6b83a55d5ef52d1b2b9d9e2dada0df3f0ae5ed995ef31e44aa442494dc6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Composition/Variant32dda6b83a55d5ef52d1b2b9d9e2dada0df3f0ae5ed995ef31e44aa442494dc6.lean#L1063).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9c3cfff6ea4c5df1007dd6f9f2bfc802f6693ab4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
