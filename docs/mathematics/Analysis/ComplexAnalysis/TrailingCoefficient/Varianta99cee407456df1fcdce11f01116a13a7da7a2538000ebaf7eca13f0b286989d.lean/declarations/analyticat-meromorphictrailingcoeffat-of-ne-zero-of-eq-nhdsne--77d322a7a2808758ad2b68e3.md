## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:853a0efe-927b-1ecb-9fbd-3b174c9e4945`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 100–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma AnalyticAt.meromorphicTrailingCoeffAt_of_ne_zero_of_eq_nhdsNE {n : ℤ} (h₁g : AnalyticAt 𝕜 g x)
    (h₂g : g x ≠ 0) (h : f =ᶠ[𝓝[≠] x] fun z ↦ (z - x) ^ n • g z) :
    meromorphicTrailingCoeffAt f x = g x := by
  have h₄ : MeromorphicAt f x := by
    rw [MeromorphicAt.meromorphicAt_congr h]
    fun_prop
  have : meromorphicOrderAt f x = n := by
    simp only [meromorphicOrderAt_eq_int_iff h₄, ne_eq]
    use g, h₁g, h₂g
    exact h
  simp_all [meromorphicTrailingCoeffAt_of_eq_nhdsNE h₁g]

/--
If `f` is analytic and does not vanish at `x`, then the trailing coefficient of `f` at `x` is `f x`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/TrailingCoefficient/Varianta99cee407456df1fcdce11f01116a13a7da7a2538000ebaf7eca13f0b286989d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/TrailingCoefficient/Varianta99cee407456df1fcdce11f01116a13a7da7a2538000ebaf7eca13f0b286989d.lean#L100).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `83ddc065af2aa54cff11436693db6cdad84a4928` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
