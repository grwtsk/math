## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8fc5a3dc-45b2-6083-320a-d4e726e5cf28`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 715–726.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rpow_le_rpow_of_exponent_ge_of_imp (hx0 : 0 ≤ x) (hx1 : x ≤ 1) (hyz : z ≤ y)
    (h : x = 0 → y = 0 → z = 0) :
    x ^ y ≤ x ^ z := by
  rcases eq_or_lt_of_le hx0 with (rfl | hx0')
  · rcases eq_or_ne y 0 with rfl | hy0
    · rw [h rfl rfl]
    · rw [zero_rpow hy0]
      apply zero_rpow_nonneg
  · exact rpow_le_rpow_of_exponent_ge hx0' hx1 hyz

/-- This version of `rpow_le_rpow_of_exponent_ge` allows `x = 0` but requires `0 ≤ z`.
See also `rpow_le_rpow_of_exponent_ge_of_imp` for the most general version. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Real/Varianta424fc5b5b195f156baed677344a973b7d59a7d57d572e436029e78bf356dc2b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Real/Varianta424fc5b5b195f156baed677344a973b7d59a7d57d572e436029e78bf356dc2b.lean#L715).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4305a837cf361c51094868adeed1c53106a2e913` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
