## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8529d532-ca9f-bdde-aa15-1520c7fcaf08`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 230–238.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rpow_add_of_nonneg (hx : 0 ≤ x) (hy : 0 ≤ y) (hz : 0 ≤ z) :
    x ^ (y + z) = x ^ y * x ^ z := by
  rcases hy.eq_or_lt with (rfl | hy)
  · rw [zero_add, rpow_zero, one_mul]
  exact rpow_add' hx (ne_of_gt <| add_pos_of_pos_of_nonneg hy hz)

/-- For `0 ≤ x`, the only problematic case in the equality `x ^ y * x ^ z = x ^ (y + z)` is for
`x = 0` and `y + z = 0`, where the right-hand side is `1` while the left-hand side can vanish.
The inequality is always true, though, and given in this lemma. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Real/Variantcd352ea029cc2c81be163a34ec852f68b5a149968e2ca51ddff4a3184bb059ff.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Real/Variantcd352ea029cc2c81be163a34ec852f68b5a149968e2ca51ddff4a3184bb059ff.lean#L230).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5afc07585a3bee0b6df9c22e16ad0cf231ef3feb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
