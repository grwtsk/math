## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f5524ff9-358d-3f7f-c4c2-667a017b4e19`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 574–584.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem toMeromorphicNFOn_eqOn_codiscrete (hf : MeromorphicOn f U) :
    f =ᶠ[Filter.codiscreteWithin U] toMeromorphicNFOn f U := by
  have : U ∈ Filter.codiscreteWithin U := by
    simp [mem_codiscreteWithin.2]
  filter_upwards [hf.analyticAt_mem_codiscreteWithin, this] with a h₁a h₂a
  simp [toMeromorphicNFOn, hf, ← (toMeromorphicNFAt_eq_self.2 h₁a.meromorphicNFAt).symm]

/--
If `f` is meromorphic on `U` and `x ∈ U`, then `f` and its conversion to normal
form on `U` agree in a punctured neighborhood of `x`.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/NormalForm/Variant830af93ffed5155071c23321eb5da467430faa59544d8b70f7c4011ad789e592.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/NormalForm/Variant830af93ffed5155071c23321eb5da467430faa59544d8b70f7c4011ad789e592.lean#L574).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6eb19e8cec95b101020b7e6f35cc4c2fea2ab545` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
