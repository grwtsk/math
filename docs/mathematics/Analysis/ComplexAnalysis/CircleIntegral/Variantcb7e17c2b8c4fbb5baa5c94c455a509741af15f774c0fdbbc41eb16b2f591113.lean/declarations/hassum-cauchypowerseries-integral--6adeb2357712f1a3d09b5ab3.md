## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1d7030f7-ff1c-0ef7-7915-2d2b8ef92db5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 556–565.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hasSum_cauchyPowerSeries_integral {f : ℂ → E} {c : ℂ} {R : ℝ} {w : ℂ}
    (hf : CircleIntegrable f c R) (hw : ‖w‖ < R) :
    HasSum (fun n => cauchyPowerSeries f c R n fun _ => w)
      ((2 * π * I : ℂ)⁻¹ • ∮ z in C(c, R), (z - (c + w))⁻¹ • f z) := by
  simp only [cauchyPowerSeries_apply]
  exact (hasSum_two_pi_I_cauchyPowerSeries_integral hf hw).const_smul _

/-- For any circle integrable function `f`, the power series `cauchyPowerSeries f c R`, `R > 0`,
converges to the Cauchy integral `(2 * π * I : ℂ)⁻¹ • ∮ z in C(c, R), (z - w)⁻¹ • f z` on the open
disc `Metric.ball c R`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/CircleIntegral/Variantcb7e17c2b8c4fbb5baa5c94c455a509741af15f774c0fdbbc41eb16b2f591113.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/CircleIntegral/Variantcb7e17c2b8c4fbb5baa5c94c455a509741af15f774c0fdbbc41eb16b2f591113.lean#L556).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `522ba9768c647004c25d3a1572e6ea4c05ff58b8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
