## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aa2d538c-a2b3-be30-9427-86ffbf6028b9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 844–853.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma analyticOnNhd_derivWeierstrassP : AnalyticOnNhd ℂ ℘'[L] L.latticeᶜ :=
  L.differentiableOn_derivWeierstrassP.analyticOnNhd L.isClosed_lattice.isOpen_compl

end AnalyticderivWeierstrassPExcept

section Analytic

/-- In the power series expansion of `℘(z) = ∑ aᵢzⁱ` at some `x ∉ L`,
each `aᵢ` can be written as an infinite sum over `l ∈ L`.
This is the summand of this infinite sum. See `PeriodPair.coeff_weierstrassPSeries`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Weierstrass/Variantbfd5cd92c002cef468a16a8ea3668d473ca8a521c9a18b040bc2744a46ae60b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Weierstrass/Variantbfd5cd92c002cef468a16a8ea3668d473ca8a521c9a18b040bc2744a46ae60b9.lean#L844).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f600c2aa2552d78f482b16686323c7f1db5983a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
