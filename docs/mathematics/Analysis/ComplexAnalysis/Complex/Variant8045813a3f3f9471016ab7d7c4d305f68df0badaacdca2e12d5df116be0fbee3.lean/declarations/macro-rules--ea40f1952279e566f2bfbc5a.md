## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `macro_rules` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:39bd2f042ea0a402201633d7577acb78a5410b021237774e9cd2de296aa0ec65`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 16–24.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
local macro_rules | `($x ^ $y)   => `(HPow.hPow $x $y) -- Porting note: See issue #2220

open Classical Real Topology Filter ComplexConjugate Finset Set

namespace Complex

/-- The complex power function `x ^ y`, given by `x ^ y = exp(y log x)` (where `log` is the
principal determination of the logarithm), unless `x = 0` where one sets `0 ^ 0 = 1` and
`0 ^ y = 0` for `y ≠ 0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Complex/Variant8045813a3f3f9471016ab7d7c4d305f68df0badaacdca2e12d5df116be0fbee3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Complex/Variant8045813a3f3f9471016ab7d7c4d305f68df0badaacdca2e12d5df116be0fbee3.lean#L16).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `145f6aeaa6e2bbca2d5bf51e1503b241a61eadb0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
