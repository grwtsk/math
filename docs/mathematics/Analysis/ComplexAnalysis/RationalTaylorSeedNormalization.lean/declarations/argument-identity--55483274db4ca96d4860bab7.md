## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:aa1c8a57-00ee-f8fa-dbee-f4e6b5162895`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 50–60.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem argument_identity (a : QComplex) : argumentQ (argDen a) (argNum a) = a := by
  have hr : (a.re.den : ℚ) ≠ 0 := by exact_mod_cast Rat.den_ne_zero a.re
  have hi : (a.im.den : ℚ) ≠ 0 := by exact_mod_cast Rat.den_ne_zero a.im
  have hR := Rat.num_div_den a.re
  have hI := Rat.num_div_den a.im
  have er : (a.re.num : ℚ) = a.re * (a.re.den : ℚ) := (div_eq_iff hr).mp hR
  have ei : (a.im.num : ℚ) = a.im * (a.im.den : ℚ) := (div_eq_iff hi).mp hI
  cases a
  simp only [argumentQ, argDen, argNum, Int.cast_mul, Int.cast_natCast] at *

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/RationalTaylorSeedNormalization.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Complex/RationalTaylorSeedNormalization.lean#L50).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
