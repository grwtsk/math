## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:574d8f03-8a5c-78a3-92ce-dbdea173ab50`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–96.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Gammaℝ_ne_zero_of_re {s : ℂ} (hre : -2 < s.re) (h0 : s ≠ 0) : Gammaℝ s ≠ 0 := by
  rw [Ne, Gammaℝ_eq_zero_iff, not_exists]
  intro n hn
  rcases Nat.eq_zero_or_pos n with h | h
  · subst h; simp at hn; exact h0 hn
  · have : s.re = -(2 * n) := by rw [hn]; simp
    have : (1 : ℝ) ≤ n := by exact_mod_cast h
    linarith

/-- Γℝ (1 − s) ≠ 0 on Re s < 3, s ≠ 1. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Analytic/Variantfd4099d5bb95827e3b68dcf00547eb3402c6cbeb2805dfcec66ce255d991863b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Analytic/Variantfd4099d5bb95827e3b68dcf00547eb3402c6cbeb2805dfcec66ce255d991863b.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cd7e7663cb813ea13eff8dc9ba4aacf777775a93` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
