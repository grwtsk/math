## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8f364333-789e-fe51-b835-7e54c42247f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 302–316.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem analyticAt_changeOrigin (p : FormalMultilinearSeries 𝕜 E F) (rp : p.radius > 0) (n : ℕ) :
    AnalyticAt 𝕜 (fun x ↦ p.changeOrigin x n) 0 :=
  (FormalMultilinearSeries.hasFPowerSeriesOnBall_changeOrigin p n rp).analyticAt

end FormalMultilinearSeries


section

variable [CompleteSpace F] {f : E → F} {p : FormalMultilinearSeries 𝕜 E F} {s : Set E}
  {x y : E} {r : ℝ≥0∞}

/-- If a function admits a power series expansion `p` within a set `s` on a ball `B (x, r)`, then
it also admits a power series on any subball of this ball (even with a different center provided
it belongs to `s`), given by `p.changeOrigin`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/ChangeOrigin/Variant8f443e449f8ba7f331785f806a43a91d998066344ea8647ab75b8d770245bd4c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/ChangeOrigin/Variant8f443e449f8ba7f331785f806a43a91d998066344ea8647ab75b8d770245bd4c.lean#L302).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a45a0f0433d855565817fc2da22b97564dc61173` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
