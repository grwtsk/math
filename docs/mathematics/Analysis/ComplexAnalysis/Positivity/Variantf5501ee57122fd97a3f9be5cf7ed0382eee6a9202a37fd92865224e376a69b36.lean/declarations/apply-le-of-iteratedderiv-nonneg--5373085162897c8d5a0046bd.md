## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ce78bc8e-dfaa-647f-f353-a369deaf702c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 65–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem apply_le_of_iteratedDeriv_nonneg {f : ℂ → ℂ} {c : ℂ} (hf : Differentiable ℂ f)
    (h : ∀ n ≠ 0, 0 ≤ iteratedDeriv n f c) ⦃z : ℂ⦄ (hz : c ≤ z) :
    f c ≤ f z := by
  have h' (n : ℕ) : 0 ≤ iteratedDeriv n (f · - f c) c := by
    cases n with
    | zero => simp only [iteratedDeriv_zero, sub_self, le_refl]
    | succ n =>
      specialize h (n + 1) n.succ_ne_zero
      rw [iteratedDeriv_succ'] at h ⊢
      rwa [funext fun x ↦ deriv_sub_const (f := f) (x := x) (f c)]
  exact sub_nonneg.mp <| nonneg_of_iteratedDeriv_nonneg (hf.sub_const _) h' hz

/-- An entire function whose iterated derivatives at `c` are all real with alternating signs
(except possibly the value itself) has values of the form `f c + nonneg. real` along the
set `c - ℝ≥0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Positivity/Variantf5501ee57122fd97a3f9be5cf7ed0382eee6a9202a37fd92865224e376a69b36.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Positivity/Variantf5501ee57122fd97a3f9be5cf7ed0382eee6a9202a37fd92865224e376a69b36.lean#L65).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b44c0396d403cf1cc4a168e937bd9bb19683c430` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
