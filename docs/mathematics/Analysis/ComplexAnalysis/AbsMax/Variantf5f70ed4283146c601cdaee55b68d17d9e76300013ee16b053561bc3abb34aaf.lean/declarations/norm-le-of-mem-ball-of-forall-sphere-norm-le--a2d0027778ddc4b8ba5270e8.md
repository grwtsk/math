## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7c617b5a-a26c-d2d9-9ec8-25cc34ca3ea4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 28–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (hd : Differentiable ℂ f) (hrpos : 0 < r)
    (hz : z ∈ Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) r) (hsphere : ∀ u : ℂ, ‖u‖ = r → ‖f u‖ ≤ C) :
    ‖f z‖ ≤ C := by
  let U : Set ℂ := Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) r
  have hfront : ∀ u ∈ frontier U, ‖f u‖ ≤ C := by
    intro u hu
    have hur : ‖u‖ = r := by
      have hfront' : frontier (Metric.ball (0 : ℂ) r) = Metric.sphere (0 : ℂ) r := by
        simpa using (frontier_ball (x := (0 : ℂ)) (r := r) (ne_of_gt hrpos))
      have : u ∈ Metric.sphere (0 : ℂ) r := by simpa [U, hfront'] using hu

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/AbsMax/Variantf5f70ed4283146c601cdaee55b68d17d9e76300013ee16b053561bc3abb34aaf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/AbsMax/Variantf5f70ed4283146c601cdaee55b68d17d9e76300013ee16b053561bc3abb34aaf.lean#L28).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9828489fabc9fe1d57be48d6e107796025c52ad5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
