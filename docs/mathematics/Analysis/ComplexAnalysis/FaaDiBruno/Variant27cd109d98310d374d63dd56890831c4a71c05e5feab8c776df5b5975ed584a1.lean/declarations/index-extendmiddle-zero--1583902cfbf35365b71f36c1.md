## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:16b4c269-c1da-81c2-2d9a-723600eefe40`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 434–440.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma index_extendMiddle_zero (c : OrderedFinpartition n) (i : Fin c.length) :
    (c.extendMiddle i).index 0 = i := by
  have : (c.extendMiddle i).emb i 0 = 0 := by simp [extendMiddle]
  conv_rhs at this => rw [← (c.extendMiddle i).emb_invEmbedding 0]
  contrapose! this
  exact (c.extendMiddle i).emb_ne_emb_of_ne (Ne.symm this)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/FaaDiBruno/Variant27cd109d98310d374d63dd56890831c4a71c05e5feab8c776df5b5975ed584a1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/FaaDiBruno/Variant27cd109d98310d374d63dd56890831c4a71c05e5feab8c776df5b5975ed584a1.lean#L434).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f477fa6f2548668fcb691bac6d2cc395ee3964b4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
