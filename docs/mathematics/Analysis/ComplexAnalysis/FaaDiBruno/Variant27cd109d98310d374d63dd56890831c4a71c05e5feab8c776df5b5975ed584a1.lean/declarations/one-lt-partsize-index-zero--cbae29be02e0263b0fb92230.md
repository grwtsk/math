## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f1281a98-a378-000c-a6fb-3efdd7ab59e2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 257–294.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Extending and shrinking ordered finpartitions

We show how an ordered finpartition can be extended to the left, either by adding a new atomic
part (in `extendLeft`) or adding the new element to an existing part (in `extendMiddle`).
Conversely, one can shrink a finpartition by deleting the element to the left, with a different
behavior if it was an atomic part (in `eraseLeft`, in which case the number of parts decreases by
one) or if it belonged to a non-atomic part (in `eraseMiddle`, in which case the number of parts
stays the same).

These operations are inverse to each other, giving rise to an equivalence between
`((c : OrderedFinpartition n) × Option (Fin c.length))` and `OrderedFinpartition (n + 1)`
called `OrderedFinPartition.extendEquiv`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/FaaDiBruno/Variant27cd109d98310d374d63dd56890831c4a71c05e5feab8c776df5b5975ed584a1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/FaaDiBruno/Variant27cd109d98310d374d63dd56890831c4a71c05e5feab8c776df5b5975ed584a1.lean#L257).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
