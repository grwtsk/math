## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0536c117-c720-d699-4362-a05e4adf4191`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 98–104.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma eventuallyConst_nhdsNE_iff_meromorphicOrderAt_sub_eq_top :
    EventuallyConst f (𝓝[≠] x) ↔ ∃ c, meromorphicOrderAt (f · - c) x = ⊤ := by
  simp only [eventuallyConst_iff_exists_eventuallyEq, meromorphicOrderAt_eq_top_iff,
    sub_eq_zero, EventuallyEq]

/-- The order of a meromorphic function `f` at `z₀` equals an integer `n` iff `f` can locally be
written as `f z = (z - z₀) ^ n • g z`, where `g` is analytic and does not vanish at `z₀`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Order/Variantb73d868bad2819a47f6ff56a09840a3931b2af40bfb03f80ef4b942bc9815b59.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Order/Variantb73d868bad2819a47f6ff56a09840a3931b2af40bfb03f80ef4b942bc9815b59.lean#L98).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `66318e292faf329e4d3d60546920c8de585ae8d5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
