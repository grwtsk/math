## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1f3dd726-5780-e5b3-4bf9-812916e9ce04`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 562–571.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma meromorphicOrderAt_add_eq_right_of_lt (hf₁ : MeromorphicAt f₁ x)
    (h : meromorphicOrderAt f₂ x < meromorphicOrderAt f₁ x) :
    meromorphicOrderAt (f₁ + f₂) x = meromorphicOrderAt f₂ x := by
  rw [add_comm]
  exact meromorphicOrderAt_add_eq_left_of_lt hf₁ h

/--
If two meromorphic functions have unequal orders, then the order of their sum is
exactly the minimum of the orders of the summands.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Order/Variant8dbd97d7fcf7015efe00632c246c13a71f064e752436c4074e0acd453ab74f8e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Order/Variant8dbd97d7fcf7015efe00632c246c13a71f064e752436c4074e0acd453ab74f8e.lean#L562).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ace2447fe9662ea6c0b2f7078d2d3402604e1035` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
