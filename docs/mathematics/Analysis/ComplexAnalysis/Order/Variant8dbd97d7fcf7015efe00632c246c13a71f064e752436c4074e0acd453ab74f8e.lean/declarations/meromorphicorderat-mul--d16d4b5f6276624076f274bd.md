## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:594cd870-f7a9-34cc-4ca9-ec097f431c93`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 402–409.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem meromorphicOrderAt_mul {f g : 𝕜 → 𝕜} (hf : MeromorphicAt f x) (hg : MeromorphicAt g x) :
    meromorphicOrderAt (f * g) x = meromorphicOrderAt f x + meromorphicOrderAt g x :=
  meromorphicOrderAt_smul hf hg

@[deprecated (since := "2025-05-22")]
alias MeromorphicAt.order_mul := meromorphicOrderAt_mul

/-- The order multiplies by `n` when taking a meromorphic function to its `n`th power. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Order/Variant8dbd97d7fcf7015efe00632c246c13a71f064e752436c4074e0acd453ab74f8e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Order/Variant8dbd97d7fcf7015efe00632c246c13a71f064e752436c4074e0acd453ab74f8e.lean#L402).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ace2447fe9662ea6c0b2f7078d2d3402604e1035` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
