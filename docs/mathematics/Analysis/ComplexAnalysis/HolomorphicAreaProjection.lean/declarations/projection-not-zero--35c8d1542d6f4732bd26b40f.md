## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:91553c46-b8d7-8dc9-cf6d-baed16eb1fa4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 261–271.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem projection_not_zero (hOpen : D.IsOpenCover)
    (hArea : (volume : Measure ℂ) D.X.carrier < ∞) (x : D.X.carrier) :
    bergmanProjection hOpen ≠ 0 := by
  intro h
  have he := congrArg (fun T : AmbientL2 D.X →L[ℂ] AmbientL2 D.X =>
    T (l2Embedding hOpen (kernelVector hOpen x))) h
  rw [bergmanProjection_embedding, ContinuousLinearMap.zero_apply] at he
  apply kernelVector_ne_zero hOpen hArea x
  exact (l2Embedding hOpen).injective (by simpa only [map_zero] using he)

/-- A concrete disk instance supplies the finite-area hypothesis and a real point. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/HolomorphicAreaProjection.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Complex/HolomorphicAreaProjection.lean#L261).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ccfe1a0754e4306ebdd40e97b69fd71cb1f99352` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
