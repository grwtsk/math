## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:535c7715-e69c-b39f-bb83-b9c302367bb0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–63.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma norm_inv_pow_le_one_of_one_le_norm (u : ℂ) (n : ℕ) (hu : (1 : ℝ) ≤ ‖u‖) :
    ‖(u ^ n)⁻¹‖ ≤ 1 := by
  have hge : (1 : ℝ) ≤ ‖u ^ n‖ := by
    rw [Complex.norm_pow]
    exact one_le_pow₀ hu
  calc ‖(u ^ n)⁻¹‖ = ‖(1 : ℂ) / u ^ n‖ := by rw [inv_eq_one_div]
    _ = 1 / ‖u ^ n‖ := by
        have hone : ‖(1 : ℂ)‖ = (1 : ℝ) := by simpa using Complex.norm_natCast 1
        rw [Complex.norm_div, hone]
    _ ≤ 1 := by simpa [one_div] using inv_le_one_of_one_le₀ hge

/-- The reflected point `1 - z` is not `1` if `z` is nonzero. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Norm/Variantc5a1d8df27f8ca9cb9424232c3355c7123a15e2efc56498f2eb1f26c81bcf663.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Norm/Variantc5a1d8df27f8ca9cb9424232c3355c7123a15e2efc56498f2eb1f26c81bcf663.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0dba63ceaa3b5743984904c9983471d8d10b279d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
