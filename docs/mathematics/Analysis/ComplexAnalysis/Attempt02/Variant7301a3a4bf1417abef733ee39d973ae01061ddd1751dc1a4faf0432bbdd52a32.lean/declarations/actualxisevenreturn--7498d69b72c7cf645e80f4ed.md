## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:557ad30d902edfe6c93b888fc433d29a88b15441c5233cd64674dd500523d31d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 39–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def actualXiSevenReturn (s : ℂ) : ℂ :=
  -deriv riemannZeta s / riemannZeta s - actualClosedMangoldtMellinHeadSeven s +
    ((Chebyshev.psi 7 + 2 * (Real.eulerMascheroniConstant + 1 - Real.log 2) : ℝ) : ℂ) *
      (7 : ℂ) ^ (-s) - s * (7 : ℂ) ^ (1 - s) / (s - 1)

/-- The same complete return is regularized at one using authentic source derivatives. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Attempt02/Variant7301a3a4bf1417abef733ee39d973ae01061ddd1751dc1a4faf0432bbdd52a32.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/Attempt02/Variant7301a3a4bf1417abef733ee39d973ae01061ddd1751dc1a4faf0432bbdd52a32.lean#L39).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a83961a0da5723d4fe92fa223fd245e6d7b1993` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
