## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3526d6f8-1888-5134-35c8-55ad6b879b1f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 259–268.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eqOn_of_preconnected_of_mem_closure (hf : AnalyticOnNhd 𝕜 f U) (hg : AnalyticOnNhd 𝕜 g U)
    (hU : IsPreconnected U) (h₀ : z₀ ∈ U) (hfg : z₀ ∈ closure ({z | f z = g z} \ {z₀})) :
    EqOn f g U :=
  hf.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_frequently_eq hg hU h₀ (mem_closure_ne_iff_frequently_within.mp hfg)

/-- The *identity principle* for analytic functions, global version: if two functions on a normed
field `𝕜` are analytic everywhere and coincide at points which accumulate to a point `z₀`, then
they coincide globally.
For higher-dimensional versions requiring that the functions coincide in a neighborhood of `z₀`,
see `AnalyticOnNhd.eq_of_eventuallyEq`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/IsolatedZeros/Variantc6e5c6f0e4ef38869162dfa3ce128d08a69df966df21d9bf5807d7420b590e1c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/IsolatedZeros/Variantc6e5c6f0e4ef38869162dfa3ce128d08a69df966df21d9bf5807d7420b590e1c.lean#L259).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `085df819054d03f4ff17f1f0725d73edad723a5a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
