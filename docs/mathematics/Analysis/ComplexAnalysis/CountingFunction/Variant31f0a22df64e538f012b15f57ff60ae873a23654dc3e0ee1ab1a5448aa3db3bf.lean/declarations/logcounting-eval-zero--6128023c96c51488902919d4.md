## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b49cf2fc-c922-63b3-f7b5-d0dfc12f05e5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 106–131.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/--
The logarithmic counting function of a meromorphic function.

If `f : 𝕜 → E` is meromorphic and `a : WithTop E` is any value, this is a logarithmically weighted
measure of the number of times the function `f` takes a given value `a` within the disk `∣z∣ ≤ r`,
counting multiplicities.  In the special case where `a = ⊤`, it counts the poles of `f`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/CountingFunction/Variant31f0a22df64e538f012b15f57ff60ae873a23654dc3e0ee1ab1a5448aa3db3bf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e8dc88b8694641418f9402620a1b0702a4f5461` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
