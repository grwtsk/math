## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:7d04479d2bfafe15ce6291add50eb4f9840fd1db384676c3e6242fd651cdc2dc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 60–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

## The Logarithmic Counting Function of a Function with Locally Finite Support
-/

/--
Definition of the logarithmic counting function, as a group morphism mapping functions `D` with
locally finite support to maps `ℝ → ℝ`.  Given `D`, the result map `logCounting D` takes a real `r :
ℝ` to a logarithmically weighted measure of values that `D` takes within the disk `∣z∣ ≤ r`.

Implementation Note: In case where `z = 0`, the term `log (r * ‖z‖⁻¹)` evaluates to zero, which is
typically different from `log r - log ‖z‖ = log r`. The summand `(D 0) * log r` compensates this,
producing cleaner formulas when the logarithmic counting function is used in the main theorms of
Value Distribution Theory.  We refer the reader to page 164 of [Lang: Introduction to Complex
Hyperbolic Spaces](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-1945-1) for more details.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/CountingFunction/Variant31f0a22df64e538f012b15f57ff60ae873a23654dc3e0ee1ab1a5448aa3db3bf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/CountingFunction/Variant31f0a22df64e538f012b15f57ff60ae873a23654dc3e0ee1ab1a5448aa3db3bf.lean#L60).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e8dc88b8694641418f9402620a1b0702a4f5461` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
