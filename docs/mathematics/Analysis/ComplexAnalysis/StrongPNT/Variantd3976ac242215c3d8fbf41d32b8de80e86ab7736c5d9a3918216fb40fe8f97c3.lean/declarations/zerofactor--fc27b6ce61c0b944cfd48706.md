## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:47650a58a3e1d343902bd4fa2883f623aeefc1596eef4e55a958c3d17efd7741`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 381–409.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def ZeroFactor (f : ℂ → ℂ) (z : ℂ) : ℂ :=
  if h1 : AnalyticAt ℂ f z then
    if h2 : analyticOrderAt f z ≠ ⊤ then
      (h1.analyticOrderAt_ne_top.mp h2).choose z
    else 0
  else 0



@[blueprint "ZeroFactorization"
  (title := "ZeroFactorization")
  (statement := /--
    Let $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ be analytic on $\overline{\mathbb{D}_1}$ with $f(0)\neq 0$.
    For all $\rho\in\mathcal{K}_f(R)$ with $R<1$ there exists $h_\rho(z)$ such that
    $h_\rho(z)$ is analytic at $\rho$, $h_\rho(\rho)\neq 0$, and
    $f(z)=(z-\rho)^{m_f(\rho)}\,h_\rho(z)$.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
    Since $f$ is analytic on neighborhoods of points in $\overline{\mathbb{D}_1}$ we know
    that there exists a series expansion about $\rho$:
    $$f(z)=\sum_{0\leq n}a_n\,(z-\rho)^n.$$
    Now if we let $m$ be the smallest number such that $a_m\neq 0$, then
    $$f(z)=\sum_{0\leq n}a_n\,(z-\rho)^n=\sum_{m\leq n}a_n\,(z-\rho)^n
      =(z-\rho)^m\sum_{m\leq n}a_n\,(z-\rho)^{n-m}=(z-\rho)^m\,h_\rho(z).$$
    Trivially, $h_\rho(z)$ is analytic at $\rho$ (we have written down the series
    expansion); now note that
    $$h_\rho(\rho)=\sum_{m\leq n}a_n(\rho-\rho)^{n-m}=\sum_{m\leq n}a_n0^{n-m}=a_m\neq 0.$$

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/StrongPNT/Variantd3976ac242215c3d8fbf41d32b8de80e86ab7736c5d9a3918216fb40fe8f97c3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/StrongPNT/Variantd3976ac242215c3d8fbf41d32b8de80e86ab7736c5d9a3918216fb40fe8f97c3.lean#L381).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4174ed82a0b4c9ac6a8ada5434aab619353c11ae` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
