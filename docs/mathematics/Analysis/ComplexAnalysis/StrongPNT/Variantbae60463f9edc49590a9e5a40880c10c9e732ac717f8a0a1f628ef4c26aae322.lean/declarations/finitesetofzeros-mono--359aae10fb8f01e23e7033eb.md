## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1b6956d5-e92e-624f-ceb8-6d607adccd31`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 352–382.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

\begin{definition}[ZeroOrder]\label{ZeroOrder}
  Let $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$.
  We define $m_f(\rho)$ as the order of the zero $\rho$ w.r.t $f$.
\end{definition}
  In LEAN, this corresponds exactly with analyticOrderAt/analyticOrderNatAt.

  (statement := /--
    Let $f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ and $\rho\in\mathbb{C}$. Then there exists $h_\rho$ such that
    $$f(z)=(z-\rho)^{m_f(\rho)}\,h_\rho(z).$$
    In LEAN, this corresponds exactly with (-.analyticOrderAt-ne-top.mp -).choose,
    but this serves as a wrapper of that with the necessary conditions.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/StrongPNT/Variantbae60463f9edc49590a9e5a40880c10c9e732ac717f8a0a1f628ef4c26aae322.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ComplexAnalysis/StrongPNT/Variantbae60463f9edc49590a9e5a40880c10c9e732ac717f8a0a1f628ef4c26aae322.lean#L352).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `febb261e8c76e0d4aec8c8de1ca02559ac821fcd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
