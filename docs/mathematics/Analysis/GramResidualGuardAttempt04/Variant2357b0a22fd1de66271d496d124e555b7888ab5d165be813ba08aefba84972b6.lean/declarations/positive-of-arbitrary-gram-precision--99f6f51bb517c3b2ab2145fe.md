## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8460cee9-9a10-fefa-a993-327c67d25be6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 94–103.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem positive_of_arbitrary_gram_precision (H : E →L[𝕜] E) (hH : H.IsSymmetric)
    (happrox : ∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε → ∃ V : E →L[𝕜] F, ‖H-V.adjoint.comp V‖ ≤ ε) :
    H.IsPositive := by
  apply positive_of_arbitrary_precision H hH
  intro ε hε
  obtain ⟨V,hV⟩ := happrox ε hε
  exact ⟨V.adjoint.comp V,ContinuousLinearMap.isPositive_adjoint_comp_self V,hV⟩
end Gram

/-- Actual operator-norm distance to the positive cone. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/GramResidualGuardAttempt04/Variant2357b0a22fd1de66271d496d124e555b7888ab5d165be813ba08aefba84972b6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/GramResidualGuardAttempt04/Variant2357b0a22fd1de66271d496d124e555b7888ab5d165be813ba08aefba84972b6.lean#L94).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c3874e6c9e0c8cf8ca9d0e640eccf758fc349f4f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
