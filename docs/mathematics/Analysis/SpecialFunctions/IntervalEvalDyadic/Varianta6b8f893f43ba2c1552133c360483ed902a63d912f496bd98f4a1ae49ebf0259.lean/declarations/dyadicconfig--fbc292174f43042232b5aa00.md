## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5670417f1287c368ef92db382bb8f5f759eb1cecb3175e0834072a1fd71ebc56`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 59–68.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure DyadicConfig where
  /-- Minimum exponent (higher = coarser). -53 ≈ IEEE double precision. -/
  precision : Int := -53
  /-- Number of Taylor series terms for transcendental functions -/
  taylorDepth : Nat := 10
  /-- Round after this many arithmetic operations (0 = always) -/
  roundAfterOps : Nat := 0
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq

/-- Default configuration with IEEE double-like precision -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/IntervalEvalDyadic/Varianta6b8f893f43ba2c1552133c360483ed902a63d912f496bd98f4a1ae49ebf0259.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/IntervalEvalDyadic/Varianta6b8f893f43ba2c1552133c360483ed902a63d912f496bd98f4a1ae49ebf0259.lean#L59).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5b7e42ee5ea1c850273e30cb3d2b3f2230e0935b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
