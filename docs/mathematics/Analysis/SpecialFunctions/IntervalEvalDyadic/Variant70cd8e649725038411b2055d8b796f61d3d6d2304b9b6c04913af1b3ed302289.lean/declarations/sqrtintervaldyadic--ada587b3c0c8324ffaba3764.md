## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:816ff6f712d7782115b9332505b8591610da83ec329b65223335f87b03ac9ebf`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 171–178.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sqrtIntervalDyadic (I : IntervalDyadic) (cfg : DyadicConfig) : IntervalDyadic :=
  IntervalDyadic.sqrt I cfg.precision

/-- log interval: conservative global bound.
    For any x > 0, log(x) ∈ (-∞, ∞), but we use a finite interval.
    For x ∈ [lo, hi] with lo > 0:
    - log is monotone, so log(x) ∈ [log(lo), log(hi)]
    - Conservative bound: use [-100, max(hi, 1)] as a wide safe interval -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/IntervalEvalDyadic/Variant70cd8e649725038411b2055d8b796f61d3d6d2304b9b6c04913af1b3ed302289.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/IntervalEvalDyadic/Variant70cd8e649725038411b2055d8b796f61d3d6d2304b9b6c04913af1b3ed302289.lean#L171).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `416f03a2e1f7ed79cc306cd97a6cc17f15baf6aa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
