## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3c70d440-4cd8-c636-922c-71836fabdc78`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 479–485.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Gamma_eq_zero_iff (s : ℂ) : Gamma s = 0 ↔ ∃ m : ℕ, s = -m := by
  constructor
  · contrapose!; exact Gamma_ne_zero
  · rintro ⟨m, rfl⟩; exact Gamma_neg_nat_eq_zero m
#align complex.Gamma_eq_zero_iff Complex.Gamma_eq_zero_iff

/-- A weaker, but easier-to-apply, version of `Complex.Gamma_ne_zero`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Beta/Variant44c59b9d64006cb35e38d1ccd5cf7aef8106c15d79024c0db80a6553678f37a2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Beta/Variant44c59b9d64006cb35e38d1ccd5cf7aef8106c15d79024c0db80a6553678f37a2.lean#L479).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8205d98c464988b5b42b312a91dbbd200b08876a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
