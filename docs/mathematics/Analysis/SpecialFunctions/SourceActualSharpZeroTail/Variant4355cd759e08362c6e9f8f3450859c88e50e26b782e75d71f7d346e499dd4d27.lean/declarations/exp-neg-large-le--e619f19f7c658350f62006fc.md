## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c174129b-74dd-f2e5-ba31-190ef507445e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 175–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    Real.exp (-A) ≤ (6 : ℝ) ^ 6 / 91 ^ 6 := by

  have he : A / 6 ≤ Real.exp (A / 6) := by linarith [Real.add_one_le_exp (A / 6)]
  have hp := pow_le_pow_left₀ hA0 he 6
  have hp91 := pow_le_pow_left₀ (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) ≤ 91) hA 6

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/SourceActualSharpZeroTail/Variant4355cd759e08362c6e9f8f3450859c88e50e26b782e75d71f7d346e499dd4d27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/SourceActualSharpZeroTail/Variant4355cd759e08362c6e9f8f3450859c88e50e26b782e75d71f7d346e499dd4d27.lean#L175).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5295d509e939a4e7b853d6c2e4ecf0fd24fc69fc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
