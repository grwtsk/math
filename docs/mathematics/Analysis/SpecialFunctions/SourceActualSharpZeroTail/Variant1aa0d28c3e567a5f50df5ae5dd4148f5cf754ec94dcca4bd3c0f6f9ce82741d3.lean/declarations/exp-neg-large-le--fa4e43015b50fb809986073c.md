## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d5ddf8e4-00c8-8ac6-c465-5bd531c22fc4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 174–192.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exp_neg_large_le {A : ℝ} (hA : 91 ≤ A) :
    Real.exp (-A) ≤ (6 : ℝ) ^ 6 / 91 ^ 6 := by
  have hA0 : 0 ≤ A / 6 := by linarith
  have he : A / 6 ≤ Real.exp (A / 6) := by linarith [Real.add_one_le_exp (A / 6)]
  have hp := pow_le_pow_left₀ hA0 he 6
  have hp91 := pow_le_pow_left₀ (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) ≤ 91) hA 6
  have hexp : Real.exp (A / 6) ^ 6 = Real.exp A := by
    rw [← Real.exp_nat_mul]
    congr 1
    ring
  rw [hexp] at hp
  have hlow : (91 : ℝ) ^ 6 / 6 ^ 6 ≤ Real.exp A := by
    rw [div_pow] at hp
    nlinarith
  rw [Real.exp_neg]
  have h := inv_le_inv₀ (by norm_num : (0 : ℝ) < 91 ^ 6 / 6 ^ 6) hlow
  simpa only [inv_div] using h

end RH16ActualSharpZeroTail
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/SourceActualSharpZeroTail/Variant1aa0d28c3e567a5f50df5ae5dd4148f5cf754ec94dcca4bd3c0f6f9ce82741d3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/SourceActualSharpZeroTail/Variant1aa0d28c3e567a5f50df5ae5dd4148f5cf754ec94dcca4bd3c0f6f9ce82741d3.lean#L174).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c04bacfaaf651017a41122f3e7c9f22a8d608b57` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
