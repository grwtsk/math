## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1e2e4ad2-b939-a7ba-b5e9-8c8c3aa1857e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 34–49.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma mul_four_le_exp_add {a b c d A B C D : ℝ}
    (hb0 : 0 ≤ b) (hc0 : 0 ≤ c) (hd0 : 0 ≤ d)
    (ha : a ≤ exp A) (hb : b ≤ exp B) (hc : c ≤ exp C) (hd : d ≤ exp D) :
    a * b * c * d ≤ exp (A + B + C + D) := by
  have hab : a * b ≤ exp A * exp B :=
    mul_le_mul ha hb hb0 (exp_pos A).le
  have habc : (a * b) * c ≤ (exp A * exp B) * exp C :=
    mul_le_mul hab hc hc0 (by positivity)
  have hprod : a * b * c * d ≤ exp A * exp B * exp C * exp D :=
    mul_le_mul habc hd hd0 (by positivity)
  calc
    a * b * c * d ≤ exp A * exp B * exp C * exp D := hprod
    _ = exp (A + B + C + D) := by
        rw [← exp_add, ← exp_add, ← exp_add]

/-- Once `x ≤ A` and `1 ≤ A`, the factor `2x` is dominated by `exp (2A²)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Exp/Variant2c8494e1e98af1331d68b92d4eb935d0b00afbd3eec537bf19debcd86f2692cf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Exp/Variant2c8494e1e98af1331d68b92d4eb935d0b00afbd3eec537bf19debcd86f2692cf.lean#L34).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b36fc9e9b9882a55a772ba17412132bc14df1a82` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
