## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f297cbbd2c4d7e416f006702551e42d7effbebee613e62c3a59a53c537de5457`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 363–366.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable abbrev evalAlong (e : Expr) (ρ : Nat → ℝ) (idx : Nat) : ℝ → ℝ :=
  fun t => eval (updateVar ρ idx t) e

/-- The set of free variable indices in an expression -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Expr/Variant929722716cf289d8aad98e29472e5575b7ba8df9d4f2bc85ead2b2045c986e05.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Expr/Variant929722716cf289d8aad98e29472e5575b7ba8df9d4f2bc85ead2b2045c986e05.lean#L363).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `138486839d71214f386f94d3481e400319a9b832` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
