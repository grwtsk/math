## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6eea66ee-cd40-75f7-fbcd-2308439477b7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 677–693.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cosh_evalSet_correct
    (f : ℝ → ℝ) (tm : TaylorModel) (degree : ℕ)
    (hf : ∀ x ∈ tm.domain, f x ∈ tm.evalSet x) :

  intro x hx
  simp only [cosh, evalSet, Set.mem_setOf_eq]

    have hfx_in_dom : f x ∈ (tmCosh tm.bound degree).domain := hdomain ▸ hfbound
    have hcosh_bound : Real.cosh (f x) ∈ (tmCosh tm.bound degree).bound := by
      apply taylorModel_correct (tmCosh tm.bound degree) Real.cosh
        (fun z hz => tmCosh_correct tm.bound degree z hz) (f x) hfx_in_dom

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Expr/Variant60318a0bba2a1193138f79971863470f16c755c3207652c36cb4f4aa4da8a850.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Expr/Variant60318a0bba2a1193138f79971863470f16c755c3207652c36cb4f4aa4da8a850.lean#L677).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bf961c73085cd288d6c5efc32e854e4510fee259` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
