## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d4dd6bf5-5f67-2e06-5c15-0dfef07e24eb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–83.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem cosh_artanh {x : ℝ} (hx : x ∈ Ioo (-1) 1) : cosh (artanh x) = 1 / √(1 - x ^ 2) := by
  have : 0 < √((1 + x) / (1 - x)) := sqrt_pos_of_pos <| div_pos (by grind) (by grind)
  rw [← one_pow, sq_sub_sq 1 x, sqrt_mul]
    <;> grind [artanh, cosh_eq, exp_neg, exp_log, sqrt_div]

/-- `artanh` is the right inverse of `tanh` over (-1, 1). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Artanh/Varianteeab772633fe2180fb251ed1888770cf1b30b7f95ab5ee5c94cde4ce4c625da7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Artanh/Varianteeab772633fe2180fb251ed1888770cf1b30b7f95ab5ee5c94cde4ce4c625da7.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4646d9f50c85758b8278e4c6572eb76a252c918c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
