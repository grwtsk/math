## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:476b1be9-6593-0ce7-ec96-15ba6a356507`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 441–460.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem differentiableAt_Gamma (s : ℂ) (hs : ∀ m : ℕ, s ≠ -m) : DifferentiableAt ℂ Gamma s := by
  let n := ⌊1 - s.re⌋₊ + 1
  have hn : 1 - s.re < n := by exact_mod_cast Nat.lt_floor_add_one (1 - s.re)
  apply (differentiableAt_GammaAux s n hn hs).congr_of_eventuallyEq
  let S := {t : ℂ | 1 - t.re < n}
  have : S ∈ 𝓝 s := by
    rw [mem_nhds_iff]; use S
    refine' ⟨Subset.rfl, _, hn⟩
    have : S = re ⁻¹' Ioi (1 - n : ℝ) := by
      ext; rw [preimage, Ioi, mem_setOf_eq, mem_setOf_eq, mem_setOf_eq]; exact sub_lt_comm
    rw [this]
    refine' Continuous.isOpen_preimage continuous_re _ isOpen_Ioi
  apply eventuallyEq_of_mem this
  intro t ht; rw [mem_setOf_eq] at ht
  apply Gamma_eq_GammaAux; linarith
#align complex.differentiable_at_Gamma Complex.differentiableAt_Gamma

end GammaHasDeriv

/-- At `s = 0`, the Gamma function has a simple pole with residue 1. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Basic/Variant75c1f3c944542ddc816a86a97792b2db0b03ce817fa87706caeb8eba0d19554d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Basic/Variant75c1f3c944542ddc816a86a97792b2db0b03ce817fa87706caeb8eba0d19554d.lean#L441).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7955ef85b393fe1fd289876bb27a17a94b86454c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
