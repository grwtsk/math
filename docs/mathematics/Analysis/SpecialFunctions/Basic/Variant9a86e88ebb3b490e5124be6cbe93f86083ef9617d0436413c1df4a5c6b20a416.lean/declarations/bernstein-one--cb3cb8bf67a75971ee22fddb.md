## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:adfba37f-7e65-d495-96a1-2b7040bd2d86`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–98.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem bernstein_one (degree : ℕ) (i : Fin (degree + 1)) :
    bernstein degree i 1 = if i = Fin.last degree then 1 else 0 := by
  by_cases hi : i = Fin.last degree
  · subst i
    simp [bernstein]
  · have hval : i.1 ≠ degree := fun h => hi (Fin.ext h)
    have hlt : i.1 < degree := lt_of_le_of_ne i.is_le hval
    have hsub : degree - i.1 ≠ 0 := Nat.ne_of_gt (Nat.sub_pos_of_lt hlt)
    simp [bernstein, hi, hsub]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Basic/Variant9a86e88ebb3b490e5124be6cbe93f86083ef9617d0436413c1df4a5c6b20a416.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Basic/Variant9a86e88ebb3b490e5124be6cbe93f86083ef9617d0436413c1df4a5c6b20a416.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c0908036b4fb4dc123caf39f42cc40b2783d587c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
