## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:64671742309f1d270d89a3a919217f74058a9e6cb1ce85b44afe9db0a311b6a1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 29–35.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def phase (γ : ℝ) : EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin 2) :=
  WithLp.toLp 2 (fun i => Complex.exp (Complex.I * (-γ * primeLog i : ℝ)))

/-- The phase distance in this module, with the following exact parameterization.

def phaseDistance (γ η : ℝ) : ℝ := ‖phase γ - phase η‖
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/PrimePhaseGeometry/Variant8613b7e557c6f49af50f32dc5bf4189fdeb685a16bbffa2ee19fc6811de3aaea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/PrimePhaseGeometry/Variant8613b7e557c6f49af50f32dc5bf4189fdeb685a16bbffa2ee19fc6811de3aaea.lean#L29).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fbd89ec425e1ffc22088cda066df48734957e973` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
