## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a046d4ff-47e4-ba0e-c6fc-65532e0f92b8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 104–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem windowValue_history_independent
    (gain replacement : ∀ n, I (n + 1) → I n → ℂ)
    (residual otherResidual : ∀ n, I n × I n → ℂ)
    (test otherTest : ∀ n, I n → ℂ) (tail : ℝ) (k : ℕ)
    (sameResidual : residual k = otherResidual k) (sameTest : test k = otherTest k) :
    windowValue gain residual test tail k = windowValue replacement otherResidual otherTest tail k := by
  simp only [windowValue_eq_terminal, sameResidual, sameTest]

end Window

/-- Terminal input containment alone suffices for the endpoint evaluator.
The residual disk must enclose the COMPLETE actual terminal residual. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/ErrorBounds/GramWindowEndpointNormalForm.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ErrorBounds/GramWindowEndpointNormalForm.lean#L104).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `81a9cc507e91e2991d7b34477476fcbbd77ce263` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
