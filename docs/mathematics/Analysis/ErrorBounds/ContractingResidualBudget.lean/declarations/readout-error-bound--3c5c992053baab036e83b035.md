## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fb83aa41-0884-4422-6846-cba255a45afb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 147–163.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem readout_error_bound (weight coefficient residual : ι → ℝ)
    (actual approximate : ℝ)
    (readout : actual - approximate = ∑ i, coefficient i * residual i)
    (consumerBound : ∀ i, |coefficient i| ≤ weight i) :
    |actual - approximate| ≤ channelMass weight residual := by
  rw [readout]
  calc
    |∑ i, coefficient i * residual i| ≤ ∑ i, |coefficient i * residual i| := by
      simpa only [Real.norm_eq_abs] using
        (norm_sum_le Finset.univ (fun i => coefficient i * residual i))
    _ = ∑ i, |coefficient i| * |residual i| := by simp only [abs_mul]
    _ ≤ channelMass weight residual := by
      exact Finset.sum_le_sum fun i _ =>
        mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right (consumerBound i) (abs_nonneg (residual i))

/-- Signed channel evolution yields a weighted l1 recurrence through COLUMN bounds.
Absolute values retain sign-changing and off-diagonal mixing without claiming cancellation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/ErrorBounds/ContractingResidualBudget.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ErrorBounds/ContractingResidualBudget.lean#L147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `08b8fbaf12492620046507e4b8be32ea263656a4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
