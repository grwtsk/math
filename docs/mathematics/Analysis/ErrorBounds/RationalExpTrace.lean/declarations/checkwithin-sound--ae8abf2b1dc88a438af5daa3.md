## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ff869509-0e29-380e-2c22-503127efa912`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 201–209.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem checkWithin_sound {w : Coordinates} {B ε : ℚ} {s M : ℕ} {tr : Trace}
    (h : checkWithin w B s M tr ε = true) :
    ‖Complex.exp (toComplex w) - toComplex (valueAt tr s)‖ ≤ (ε : ℝ) := by
  have h' : check w B s M tr = true ∧
      (0 ≤ ε ∧ outputRadius B s M tr ≤ ε) := by
    simpa only [checkWithin, Bool.and_eq_true, decide_eq_true_eq] using h
  exact (check_sound h'.1).trans (by exact_mod_cast h'.2.2)

/-- A missing seed or local step cannot be repaired by a zero default. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/ErrorBounds/RationalExpTrace.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ErrorBounds/RationalExpTrace.lean#L201).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `875ba04830194bd422818d22a705a02d0cf197ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
