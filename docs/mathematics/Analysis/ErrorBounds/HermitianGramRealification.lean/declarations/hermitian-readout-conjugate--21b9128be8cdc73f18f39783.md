## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:53e751da-43df-bba0-8dbd-40933f14108e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–120.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hermitian_readout_conjugate (test : ι → ℂ) (H : ι × ι → ℂ)
    (hermitian : Hermitian H) : conj (complexReadout test H) = complexReadout test H := by
  have entry (i j : ι) : conj (conj (test i) * H (i, j) * test j) =
      conj (test j) * H (j, i) * test i := by
    rw [hermitian i j]
    simp [mul_comm, mul_left_comm]
  calc
    _ = ∑ i, ∑ j, conj (conj (test i) * H (i, j) * test j) := by
      simp only [complexReadout, Fintype.sum_prod_type, map_sum]
    _ = ∑ i, ∑ j, conj (test j) * H (j, i) * test i := by simp only [entry]
    _ = _ := by
      rw [Finset.sum_comm]
      simp only [complexReadout, Fintype.sum_prod_type]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/ErrorBounds/HermitianGramRealification.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ErrorBounds/HermitianGramRealification.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `49cca1f22a48fb43604ea01c60055567057518e5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
