## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bebac9be-eef7-a40c-a509-83643f2fd759`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 256–271.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eventProbability_exists_le {Ω ι : Type*} [Fintype Ω] [Fintype ι]
    (E : ι → Ω → Prop) :
    eventProbability (fun x => ∃ i, E i x) ≤ ∑ i, eventProbability (E i) := by
  have hc : ((Finset.univ : Finset Ω).filter (fun x => ∃ i, E i x)).card ≤
      ∑ i : ι, ((Finset.univ : Finset Ω).filter (E i)).card := by
    calc
      _ = (Finset.univ.biUnion (fun i : ι => Finset.univ.filter (E i))).card := by
        congr 1; ext x; simp
      _ ≤ _ := Finset.card_biUnion_le
  unfold eventProbability
  rw [← Finset.sum_div]
  apply div_le_div_of_nonneg_right _ (by positivity)
  norm_cast
  convert hc using 1
  congr 1; ext x; simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/ZModPartitionConcentration.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Fourier/ZModPartitionConcentration.lean#L256).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b789d9a7afccd1f449a4acf909017b7471b9a465` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
