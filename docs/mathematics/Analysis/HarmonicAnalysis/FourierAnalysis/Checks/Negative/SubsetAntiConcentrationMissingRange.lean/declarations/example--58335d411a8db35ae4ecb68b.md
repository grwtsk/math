## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `example` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:28d4a6e3162d9c092eb344093ea08c401fa475408ef733f72288082e7c761ac5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 5–11.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
example {p m : ℕ} [NeZero p] (hp : p.Prime) (S : Finset (ZMod p))
    (hn : 2 ≤ S.card) (z : ZMod p) :
    (GRWTSK.ZModSubsetSum.subsetSumProbability S m z : ℝ) ≤
      1 / p + (2 : ℝ) ^ 24 / ((S.card : ℝ) * Real.sqrt m) := by
  have source_bound :=
    GRWTSK.ZModBalancedExpectedLayers.subsetSumProbability_le_source_constant (m := m) hp S hn
  exact source_bound
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/Checks/Negative/SubsetAntiConcentrationMissingRange.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Fourier/Checks/Negative/SubsetAntiConcentrationMissingRange.lean#L5).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c2b4b19912b4f1b7b68cb39e935a072b5a946206` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
