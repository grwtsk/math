## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:825b6c28-7d9f-68f9-6479-e3f62b6010be`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 487–493.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem angleRotation_inv (θ : ℝ) : (angleRotation θ)⁻¹ = angleRotation (-θ) := by
  apply LinearIsometryEquiv.ext
  intro f
  change (rotation (Real.cos θ) (Real.sin θ) (Real.cos_sq_add_sin_sq θ)).symm f = _
  rw [rotation_symm_apply,angleRotation_apply,Real.cos_neg,Real.sin_neg]

/-- The actual angular sign involution is its own group inverse. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/046SourceDualRotation/Variant2395949699b51a0c055ab041dfe69b0883f5022235f55b9e7e9f5dfb41d0803a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/046SourceDualRotation/Variant2395949699b51a0c055ab041dfe69b0883f5022235f55b9e7e9f5dfb41d0803a.lean#L487).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `959e6105a0304eb57030fc19db79f0eeb74a502a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
