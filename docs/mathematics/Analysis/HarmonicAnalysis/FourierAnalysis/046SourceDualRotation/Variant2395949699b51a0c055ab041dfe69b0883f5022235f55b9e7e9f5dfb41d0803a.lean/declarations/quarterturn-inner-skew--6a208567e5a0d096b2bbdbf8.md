## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:653eab54-f197-2a83-9fd2-b7d0bce2db22`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 48–54.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem quarterTurn_inner_skew (f g : ComplexL2) :
    ⟪quarterTurn f,g⟫_ℂ = -⟪f,quarterTurn g⟫_ℂ := by
  have h := quarterTurn.inner_map_map f (quarterTurn g)
  rw [quarterTurn_sq,inner_neg_right] at h
  linear_combination -h

/-- The same generator as a bounded complex-linear operator. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/046SourceDualRotation/Variant2395949699b51a0c055ab041dfe69b0883f5022235f55b9e7e9f5dfb41d0803a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/046SourceDualRotation/Variant2395949699b51a0c055ab041dfe69b0883f5022235f55b9e7e9f5dfb41d0803a.lean#L48).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `959e6105a0304eb57030fc19db79f0eeb74a502a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
