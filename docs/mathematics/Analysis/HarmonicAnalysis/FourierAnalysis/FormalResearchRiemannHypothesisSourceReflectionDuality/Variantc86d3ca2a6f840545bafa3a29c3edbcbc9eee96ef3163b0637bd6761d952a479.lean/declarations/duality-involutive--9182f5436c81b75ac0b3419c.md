## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e4018ae3-61cd-84d8-d0aa-9b89b6b6da04`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 209–215.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem duality_involutive (f : ComplexL2) : signFourierDuality (signFourierDuality f) = f := by
  apply (Lp.fourierTransformₗᵢ ℝ ℂ).injective
  change 𝓕 (signFourierDuality (signFourierDuality f)) = 𝓕 f
  rw [duality_fourier,duality_fourier]
  exact signMultiplier_involutive (𝓕 f)

/-- Exact spatial reflection anti-commutation of the concrete Fourier duality. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/FormalResearchRiemannHypothesisSourceReflectionDuality/Variantc86d3ca2a6f840545bafa3a29c3edbcbc9eee96ef3163b0637bd6761d952a479.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/FormalResearchRiemannHypothesisSourceReflectionDuality/Variantc86d3ca2a6f840545bafa3a29c3edbcbc9eee96ef3163b0637bd6761d952a479.lean#L209).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ffb3db52b0a1a7dde6fff645905da675127f908` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
