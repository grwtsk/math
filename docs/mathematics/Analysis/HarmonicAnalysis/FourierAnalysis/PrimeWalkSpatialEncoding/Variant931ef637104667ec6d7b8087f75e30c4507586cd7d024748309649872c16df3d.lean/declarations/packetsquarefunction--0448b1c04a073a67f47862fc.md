## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:953cfb3456381c3fe52fa48a2b329fc69bdf62a8f0a19ba75aff51ae99935646`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 113–128.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def packetSquareFunction
    {Packet : Type*} [DecidableEq Packet]
    (packets : Finset Packet) (wavePacket : Packet → SpatialSignal) :
    SpatialPoint → ℝ :=
  fun point ↦ Real.sqrt (∑ packet ∈ packets, ‖wavePacket packet point‖ ^ 2)

/-! ## A bounded temporal readout

Restriction of a general `L²(ℝ³)` function to a line is not a bounded
`L²` trace.  The readout is therefore supplied with the exact mapping and
norm-control properties needed by the reconstruction theorem.  An eventual
implementation may use Sobolev trace regularity or a smoothed transverse
profile.

/-- Proof-carrying linear readout from spatial signals to temporal signals. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/PrimeWalkSpatialEncoding/Variant931ef637104667ec6d7b8087f75e30c4507586cd7d024748309649872c16df3d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/PrimeWalkSpatialEncoding/Variant931ef637104667ec6d7b8087f75e30c4507586cd7d024748309649872c16df3d.lean#L113).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `348c88212555163e14c821f498bb6a38b799ec60` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
