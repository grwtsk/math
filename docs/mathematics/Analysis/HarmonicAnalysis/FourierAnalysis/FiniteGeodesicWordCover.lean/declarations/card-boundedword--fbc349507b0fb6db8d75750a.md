## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5e1ae885-2e18-0c45-30fb-4d7fa28a802c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 77–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem card_boundedWord (Alphabet : Type*) [Fintype Alphabet] (L : ℕ) :
    Fintype.card (BoundedWord Alphabet L) =
      ∑ n : Fin (L + 1), (Fintype.card Alphabet) ^ n.val := by
  classical
  simp [BoundedWord, Fintype.card_sigma, Fintype.card_fun]

/-- The independent source and decoding obligations. The base
primitiveCandidates field is only a FINITE SUPPLIED UNIVERSE.
No source in it is certified geometrically by this structure alone.

short_has_code is the missing geometric word-length theorem, not
an already-proved result. The round trip protects the exact source ID,
not merely a similar trace or an arbitrary conjugate. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/FiniteGeodesicWordCover.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Fourier/FiniteGeodesicWordCover.lean#L77).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `06f01824740e0443e75a125e76e755c34dd610ea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
