## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bbc1c5b1-8312-1b12-8882-a99398fb78ce`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 138–148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem density_section_integrable {c T : ℝ} (hc : 1 < c) (hT : 0 ≤ T) (t : ℝ) :
    Integrable (density c T t) := by
  have hg := (pickupKernel_integrable hc).norm.const_mul
    ((T*Real.exp ((2*c-1)*T))*‖pickupKernel c t‖)
  have hcont : Continuous (density c T t) := by
    unfold density
    exact (continuous_const.mul (pickupKernel_continuous hc).star).mul
      ((timeKernel_continuous c T).comp (continuous_const.sub continuous_id))
  apply hg.mono' hcont.aestronglyMeasurable
  exact Eventually.of_forall (density_norm_bound hc hT t)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/QuadraticKernelTruncation.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Fourier/QuadraticKernelTruncation.lean#L138).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f6a86ceb1bdbde45ed63abe1a007d25b835c9962` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
