## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:756be77b-38c6-c9f7-422a-26778041f320`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–126.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem margin_reciprocal_le_error
    (n m : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) (hm : 1 ≤ m)
    {ε : ℝ} (hε : 0 < ε)
    (hroot :
      Real.sqrt m ≤
        largerSliceConstant ε * ε * Real.sqrt (Real.log n)) :
    1 / (ε * n) ≤
      largerSliceConstant ε * Real.sqrt (Real.log n) /
        ((n : ℝ) * Real.sqrt m) := by
  have hnR : (0 : ℝ) < n := by
    exact_mod_cast (show 0 < n by omega)
  have hmR : (0 : ℝ) < m := by
    exact_mod_cast (show 0 < m by omega)
  apply (div_le_div_iff₀
    (mul_pos hε hnR)
    (mul_pos hnR (Real.sqrt_pos.mpr hmR))).mpr
  convert mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left hroot hnR.le using 1 <;> ring

/-- The bounded-cardinality branch. The threshold is exactly one half of
`largerSliceConstant ε * ε`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/ZModLargerSliceBounds.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Fourier/ZModLargerSliceBounds.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a54fcae51d539345f95e852a6623b313c05ada0d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
