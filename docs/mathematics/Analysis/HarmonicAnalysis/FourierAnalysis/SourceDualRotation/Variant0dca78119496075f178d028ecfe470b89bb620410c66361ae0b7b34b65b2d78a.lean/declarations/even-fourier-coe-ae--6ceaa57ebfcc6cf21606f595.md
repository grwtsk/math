## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e35e817b-6c32-d884-0c86-914f5b405afe`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 436–444.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem even_fourier_coe_ae {q : ComplexL2} (hq : reflection q = q) :
    ∀ᵐ ξ ∂volume, (𝓕 q : ComplexL2) (-ξ) = (𝓕 q : ComplexL2) ξ := by
  have hf : reflection (𝓕 q : ComplexL2) = (𝓕 q : ComplexL2) := by
    rw [← fourier_reflection,hq]
  filter_upwards [reflection_coe_ae (𝓕 q : ComplexL2)] with ξ hξ
  rw [hf] at hξ
  exact hξ.symm

/-- The spectrum at paired frequencies has invariant total mass under a unit-circle rotation. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/SourceDualRotation/Variant0dca78119496075f178d028ecfe470b89bb620410c66361ae0b7b34b65b2d78a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/HarmonicAnalysis/FourierAnalysis/SourceDualRotation/Variant0dca78119496075f178d028ecfe470b89bb620410c66361ae0b7b34b65b2d78a.lean#L436).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e2257ce3b2b36cc7aa04b04aec57539781b9087a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
