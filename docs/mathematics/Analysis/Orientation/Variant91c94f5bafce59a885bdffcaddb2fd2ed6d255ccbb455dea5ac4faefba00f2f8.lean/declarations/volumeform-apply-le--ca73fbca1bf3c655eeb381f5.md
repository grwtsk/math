## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:06797ae8-092d-76d9-b3df-3afe6aa3b0e1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 257–262.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem volumeForm_apply_le (v : Fin n → E) : o.volumeForm v ≤ ∏ i : Fin n, ‖v i‖ :=
  (le_abs_self _).trans (o.abs_volumeForm_apply_le v)

/-- Let `v` be an indexed family of `n` orthogonal vectors in an oriented `n`-dimensional
real inner product space `E`. The output of the volume form of `E` when evaluated on `v` is, up to
sign, the product of the norms of the vectors `v i`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Orientation/Variant91c94f5bafce59a885bdffcaddb2fd2ed6d255ccbb455dea5ac4faefba00f2f8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Orientation/Variant91c94f5bafce59a885bdffcaddb2fd2ed6d255ccbb455dea5ac4faefba00f2f8.lean#L257).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `924691273ea55786bc6142fd5823d6882d1a88f0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
