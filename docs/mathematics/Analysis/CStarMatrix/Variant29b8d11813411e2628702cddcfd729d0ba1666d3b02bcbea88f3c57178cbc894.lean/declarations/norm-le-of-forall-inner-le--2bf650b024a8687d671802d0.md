## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:02c16716-1fec-1036-a56d-ec0deb045a95`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 609–641.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

## Replacing the uniformity and bornology

Note that while the norm that we have defined on `CStarMatrix m n A` induces the product uniformity,
it is not defeq to `Pi.uniformSpace`. In this section, we show that the norm indeed does induce
the product topology and use this fact to properly set up the
`NormedAddCommGroup (CStarMatrix m n A)` instance such that the uniformity is still
`Pi.uniformSpace` and the bornology is `Pi.instBornology`.

To do this, we locally register a `NormedAddCommGroup` instance on `CStarMatrix` which registers
the "bad" topology, and we also locally use the matrix norm `Matrix.normedAddCommGroup`
(which takes the norm of the biggest entry as the norm of the matrix)
in order to show that the map `ofMatrix` is bilipschitz. We then finally register the
`NormedAddCommGroup (C⋆ᵐᵒᵈ (n → A))` instance via `NormedAddCommGroup.ofCoreReplaceAll`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/CStarMatrix/Variant29b8d11813411e2628702cddcfd729d0ba1666d3b02bcbea88f3c57178cbc894.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/CStarMatrix/Variant29b8d11813411e2628702cddcfd729d0ba1666d3b02bcbea88f3c57178cbc894.lean#L609).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1b93218a6b4e0f9cf948ca82624fb79f93940ecf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
