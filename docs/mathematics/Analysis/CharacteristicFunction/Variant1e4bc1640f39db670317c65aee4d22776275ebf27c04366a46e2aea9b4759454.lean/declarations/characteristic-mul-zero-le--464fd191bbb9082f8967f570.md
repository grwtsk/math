## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2d287248-558a-e750-64b5-65420396f07a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–176.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem characteristic_mul_zero_le {f₁ f₂ : ℂ → ℂ} {r : ℝ} (hr : 1 ≤ r)
    (h₁f₁ : Meromorphic f₁) (h₂f₁ : ∀ z, meromorphicOrderAt f₁ z ≠ ⊤)
    (h₁f₂ : Meromorphic f₂) (h₂f₂ : ∀ z, meromorphicOrderAt f₂ z ≠ ⊤) :
    characteristic (f₁ * f₂) 0 r ≤ (characteristic f₁ 0 + characteristic f₂ 0) r := by
  simp only [characteristic, Pi.add_apply]
  rw [add_add_add_comm]
  apply add_le_add (proximity_mul_zero_le h₁f₁ h₁f₂ r)
    (logCounting_mul_zero_le hr h₁f₁ h₂f₁ h₁f₂ h₂f₂)

/--
Asymptotically, the characteristic function for the zeros of `f * g` is less than or equal to the
sum of the characteristic functions for the zeros of `f` and `g`, respectively.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/CharacteristicFunction/Variant1e4bc1640f39db670317c65aee4d22776275ebf27c04366a46e2aea9b4759454.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/CharacteristicFunction/Variant1e4bc1640f39db670317c65aee4d22776275ebf27c04366a46e2aea9b4759454.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `46b98c0c1a5399be4f5e3ad6343ca3deb08062e1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
