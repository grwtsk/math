## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:520640b4-25a1-a319-caed-3c981a6c573e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 299–379.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Convergence of the inverse of a power series

Assume that `p` is a convergent multilinear series, and let `q` be its (left or right) inverse.
Using the left-inverse formula gives
$$
q_n = - (p_1)^{-n} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sum_{i_1 + \dotsc + i_k = n} q_k (p_{i_1}, \dotsc, p_{i_k}).
$$
Assume for simplicity that we are in dimension `1` and `p₁ = 1`. In the formula for `qₙ`, the term
`q_{n-1}` appears with a multiplicity of `n-1` (choosing the index `i_j` for which `i_j = 2` while
all the other indices are equal to `1`), which indicates that `qₙ` might grow like `n!`. This is
bad for summability properties.

It turns out that the right-inverse formula is better behaved, and should instead be used for this
kind of estimate. It reads
$$
q_n = - (p_1)^{-1} \sum_{k=2}^n \sum_{i_1 + \dotsc + i_k = n} p_k (q_{i_1}, \dotsc, q_{i_k}).
$$
Here, `q_{n-1}` can only appear in the term with `k = 2`, and it only appears twice, so there is
hope this formula can lead to an at most geometric behavior.

Let `Qₙ = ‖qₙ‖`. Bounding `‖pₖ‖` with `C r^k` gives an inequality
$$
Q_n ≤ C' \sum_{k=2}^n r^k \sum_{i_1 + \dotsc + i_k = n} Q_{i_1} \dotsm Q_{i_k}.
$$

This formula is not enough to prove by naive induction on `n` a bound of the form `Qₙ ≤ D R^n`.
However, assuming that the inequality above were an equality, one could get a formula for the
generating series of the `Qₙ`:

$$
\begin{align}
Q(z) & := \sum Q_n z^n = Q_1 z + C' \sum_{2 \leq k \leq n} \sum_{i_1 + \dotsc + i_k = n}
  (r z^{i_1} Q_{i_1}) \dotsm (r z^{i_k} Q_{i_k})
\\ & = Q_1 z + C' \sum_{k = 2}^\infty (\sum_{i_1 \geq 1} r z^{i_1} Q_{i_1})
  \dotsm (\sum_{i_k \geq 1} r z^{i_k} Q_{i_k})
\\ & = Q_1 z + C' \sum_{k = 2}^\infty (r Q(z))^k
= Q_1 z + C' (r Q(z))^2 / (1 - r Q(z)).
\end{align}
$$

One can solve this formula explicitly. The solution is analytic in a neighborhood of `0` in `ℂ`,
hence its coefficients grow at most geometrically (by a contour integral argument), and therefore
the original `Qₙ`, which are bounded by these ones, are also at most geometric.

This classical argument is not really satisfactory, as it requires an a priori bound on a complex
analytic function. Another option would be to compute explicitly its terms (with binomial
coefficients) to obtain an explicit geometric bound, but this would be very painful.

Instead, we will use the above intuition, but in a slightly different form, with finite sums and an
induction. I learnt this trick in [pöschel2017siegelsternberg]. Let
$S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n Q_k a^k$ (where `a` is a positive real parameter to be chosen suitably small).
The above computation but with finite sums shows that

$$
S_n \leq Q_1 a + C' \sum_{k=2}^n (r S_{n-1})^k.
$$

In particular, $S_n \leq Q_1 a + C' (r S_{n-1})^2 / (1- r S_{n-1})$.
Assume that $S_{n-1} \leq K a$, where `K > Q₁` is fixed and `a` is small enough so that
`r K a ≤ 1/2` (to control the denominator). Then this equation gives a bound
$S_n \leq Q_1 a + 2 C' r^2 K^2 a^2$.
If `a` is small enough, this is bounded by `K a` as the second term is quadratic in `a`, and
therefore negligible.

By induction, we deduce `Sₙ ≤ K a` for all `n`, which gives in particular the fact that `aⁿ Qₙ`
remains bounded.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Inverse/Variantda4d7d448ec425207ed40552180d3e9922a3eb3d15473981d073c4761be76cd8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
