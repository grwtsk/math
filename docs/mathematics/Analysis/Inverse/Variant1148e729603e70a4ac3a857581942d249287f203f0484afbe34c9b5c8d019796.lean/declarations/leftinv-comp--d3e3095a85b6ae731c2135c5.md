## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0441aac3-79ae-9ad9-4eb1-f6fe237a72d1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–168.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! ### The right inverse of a formal multilinear series -/


/-- The right inverse of a formal multilinear series, where the `n`-th term is defined inductively
in terms of the previous ones to make sure that `p ∘ (rightInv p i) = id`. For this, the linear
term `p₁` in `p` should be invertible. In the definition, `i` is a linear isomorphism that should
coincide with `p₁`, so that one can use its inverse in the construction. The definition does not
use that `i = p₁`, but proofs that the definition is well-behaved do.

The `n`-th term in `p ∘ q` is `∑ pₖ (q_{j₁}, ..., q_{jₖ})` over `j₁ + ... + jₖ = n`. In this
expression, `qₙ` appears only once, in `p₁ (qₙ)`. We adjust the definition of `qₙ` so that this
term compensates the rest of the sum, using `i⁻¹` as an inverse to `p₁`.

These formulas only make sense when the constant term `p₀` vanishes. The definition we give is
general, but it ignores the value of `p₀`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Inverse/Variant1148e729603e70a4ac3a857581942d249287f203f0484afbe34c9b5c8d019796.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
