## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a6eceb355628faafd6b3bc8a198d0fcc752fcf24fdc0f0e1b51f98cd5aaa9f42`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 66–75.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def leftInv (p : FormalMultilinearSeries 𝕜 E F) (i : E ≃L[𝕜] F) (x : E) :
    FormalMultilinearSeries 𝕜 F E
  | 0 => ContinuousMultilinearMap.uncurry0 𝕜 _ x
  | 1 => (continuousMultilinearCurryFin1 𝕜 F E).symm i.symm
  | n + 2 =>
    -∑ c : { c : Composition (n + 2) // c.length < n + 2 },
        (leftInv p i x (c : Composition (n + 2)).length).compAlongComposition
          (p.compContinuousLinearMap i.symm) c

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Inverse/Variant1148e729603e70a4ac3a857581942d249287f203f0484afbe34c9b5c8d019796.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Inverse/Variant1148e729603e70a4ac3a857581942d249287f203f0484afbe34c9b5c8d019796.lean#L66).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1ae15ddb4cf94b1c6b5aab91380f75e505ebcd68` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
