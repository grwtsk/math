## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0bc97b3d-ffee-20f6-fcc8-307f3f083aa8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 236–251.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    simp only [Set.mem_toFinset (s := {c : Composition (n + 2) | 1 < c.length}),
      Set.mem_setOf_eq] at hc
    simp [← Composition.ne_single_iff N, Composition.eq_single_iff_length, ne_of_gt hc]
  simp [applyComposition, this]

/-- The right inverse to a formal multilinear series is indeed a right inverse, provided its linear
term is invertible and its constant term vanishes. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Inverse/Variant676ff344e9a91894a9a8764e8e930eddcb2caac22d4ec6d996db0cf006ddb019.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Inverse/Variant676ff344e9a91894a9a8764e8e930eddcb2caac22d4ec6d996db0cf006ddb019.lean#L236).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c64d69d3cc3617cbc299981ad781813f657778d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
