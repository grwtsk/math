## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:281f3d3f-b8b8-297e-edbc-0f0b1c52c0e3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 105–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem real_roots_Phi_le : Fintype.card ((Φ ℚ a b).rootSet ℝ) ≤ 3 := by
  rw [← map_Phi a b (algebraMap ℤ ℚ), Φ, ← one_mul (X ^ 5), ← C_1]
  apply (card_rootSet_le_derivative _).trans
    (Nat.succ_le_succ ((card_rootSet_le_derivative _).trans (Nat.succ_le_succ _)))
  suffices (Polynomial.rootSet (C (20 : ℚ) * X ^ 3) ℝ).Subsingleton by

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/AbelRuffini/Variante7607c6fbcb4fc8281309d84f9a41590496800905bac367ff1e33e688d0d76e4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AbelRuffini/Variante7607c6fbcb4fc8281309d84f9a41590496800905bac367ff1e33e688d0d76e4.lean#L105).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `69ebfe2a86845d9aaf45c123838043f5f28f28c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
