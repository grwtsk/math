## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `macro_rules` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:95947412d1f68e32e718846ef2412796e0415018b488b2cec9dc637bb1a719f6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 42–52.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
local macro_rules | `($x ^ $y) => `(HPow.hPow $x $y) -- Porting note: See issue lean4#2220

open Function Polynomial Polynomial.Gal Ideal

open scoped Polynomial

attribute [local instance] splits_ℚ_ℂ

variable (R : Type _) [CommRing R] (a b : ℕ)

/-- A quintic polynomial that we will show is irreducible -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/AbelRuffini/Variant1e597fa199b6199a56f06350bb551884920bfc666abb573c29fa83e2eb006aaa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AbelRuffini/Variant1e597fa199b6199a56f06350bb551884920bfc666abb573c29fa83e2eb006aaa.lean#L42).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9f6860534500563d2d1297e5a91643f81ad68e13` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
