## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8fae2090-5e75-09eb-a7cf-74de4e10052d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 297–304.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ConvexOn.convex_epigraph (hf : ConvexOn 𝕜 s f) :
    Convex 𝕜 { p : E × β | p.1 ∈ s ∧ f p.1 ≤ p.2 } := by
  rintro ⟨x, r⟩ ⟨hx, hr⟩ ⟨y, t⟩ ⟨hy, ht⟩ a b ha hb hab
  refine ⟨hf.1 hx hy ha hb hab, ?_⟩
  calc
    f (a • x + b • y) ≤ a • f x + b • f y := hf.2 hx hy ha hb hab
    _ ≤ a • r + b • t := by gcongr

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Function/Variant424667f859bbd6479490bad1996177906a316c0e2840f5e0f665599d59d185c0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Function/Variant424667f859bbd6479490bad1996177906a316c0e2840f5e0f665599d59d185c0.lean#L297).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `81e9f348f8b747b7b61acc23a9358f06ebb73fff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
