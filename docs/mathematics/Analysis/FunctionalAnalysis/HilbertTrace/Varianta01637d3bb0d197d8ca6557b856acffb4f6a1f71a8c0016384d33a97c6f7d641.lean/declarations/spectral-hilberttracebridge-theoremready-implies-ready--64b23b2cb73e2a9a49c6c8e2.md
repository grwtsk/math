## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cacd0658-aec1-fdb9-87ba-8ca14e08f689`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 81–93.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Spectral.HilbertTraceBridge.theoremReady_implies_ready
    (B : Spectral.HilbertTraceBridge.{u, v})
    (h : B.theoremReady) :
    B.ready := by
  exact ⟨h.1.1, h.2⟩

/--
Theorem-facing certificate for a Hilbert-trace bridge.

It stores the actual Hilbert-level theorem certificate for the core and the
actual packed spectral-prismatic input, and proves that the bridge's option
field matches that input.  `Option.isSome` is never proof authority.
-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/HilbertTrace/Varianta01637d3bb0d197d8ca6557b856acffb4f6a1f71a8c0016384d33a97c6f7d641.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/HilbertTrace/Varianta01637d3bb0d197d8ca6557b856acffb4f6a1f71a8c0016384d33a97c6f7d641.lean#L81).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9fa758a479d0b5330bd5d743135d3789c0ceed71` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
