## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:07455e61-a902-0b2f-9979-b46d550ba0b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 364–370.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem laplacianWithin_smul_nhds
    (v : 𝕜) (hf : ContDiffWithinAt ℝ 2 f s x) (hs : UniqueDiffOn ℝ s) :
    Δ[s] (v • f) =ᶠ[𝓝[s] x] v • (Δ[s] f) := by
  filter_upwards [(hf.eventually (by simp)).filter_mono (nhdsWithin_mono _ (Set.subset_insert ..)),
    eventually_mem_nhdsWithin] with a h₁a using laplacianWithin_smul v h₁a hs

/-- The Laplacian commutes with scalar multiplication. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Laplacian/Variant51de4bb5968b4bf78496fd67abb95c5849166b211c9c57d85eb0a831522b6597.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Laplacian/Variant51de4bb5968b4bf78496fd67abb95c5849166b211c9c57d85eb0a831522b6597.lean#L364).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9cb7e7ba0e5566e47a0a3aa04feaf3135c1437ef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
