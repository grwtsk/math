## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bec2fb3d-d534-5c43-f6e6-ee379c198da6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–94.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  have ha := ContinuousLinearMap.antilipschitz_of_forall_le_inner_map (positiveShift S α)
    (c := ⟨α, hα.le⟩) (by exact_mod_cast hα) (fun x => by

          (inner ℂ (positiveShift S α x) x).re := by

      exact hc.trans (Complex.re_le_norm _))

  simp only [map_zero, dist_zero_right, positiveShift_resolvent_apply S hS α hα] at h
  change ‖positiveResolvent S α x‖ ≤ α⁻¹ * ‖x‖ at h
  simpa only [one_div] using h

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/PositiveResolventStatements/Variantb2f222a5afcb7d576c15b9867a86ce5da6a82224e1863d34828a8c9b7b4b8586.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/PositiveResolventStatements/Variantb2f222a5afcb7d576c15b9867a86ce5da6a82224e1863d34828a8c9b7b4b8586.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6be7fa7898d403066195c967a94980cb39907ea4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
