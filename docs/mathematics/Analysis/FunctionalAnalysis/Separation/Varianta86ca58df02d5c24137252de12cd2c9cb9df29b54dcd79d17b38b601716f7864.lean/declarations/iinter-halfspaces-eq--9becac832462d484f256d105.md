## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:da12f10c-0d7d-c132-b085-b3bd7c9a65c6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 322–332.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iInter_halfSpaces_eq (hs₁ : Convex ℝ s) (hs₂ : IsClosed s) :
    ⋂ l : E →L[𝕜] 𝕜, { x | ∃ y ∈ s, re (l x) ≤ re (l y) } = s := by
  rw [Set.iInter_setOf]
  refine Set.Subset.antisymm (fun x hx => ?_) fun x hx l => ⟨x, hx, le_rfl⟩
  by_contra h
  obtain ⟨l, s, hlA, hl⟩ := geometric_hahn_banach_closed_point (𝕜 := 𝕜) hs₁ hs₂ h
  obtain ⟨y, hy, hxy⟩ := hx l
  exact ((hxy.trans_lt (hlA y hy)).trans hl).false

end RCLike
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Separation/Varianta86ca58df02d5c24137252de12cd2c9cb9df29b54dcd79d17b38b601716f7864.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Separation/Varianta86ca58df02d5c24137252de12cd2c9cb9df29b54dcd79d17b38b601716f7864.lean#L322).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e38810cea58d56eba4732b2c034caeaf8250cab` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
