## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e85122fa-d17b-90fd-4f70-5107f8878334`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 114–119.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Convex.set_average_mem_closure (hs : Convex ℝ s) (h0 : μ t ≠ 0) (ht : μ t ≠ ∞)
    (hfs : ∀ᵐ x ∂μ.restrict t, f x ∈ s) (hfi : IntegrableOn f t μ) :
    (⨍ x in t, f x ∂μ) ∈ closure s :=
  hs.closure.set_average_mem isClosed_closure h0 ht (hfs.mono fun _ hx => subset_closure hx) hfi
#align convex.set_average_mem_closure Convex.set_average_mem_closure

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Integral/Variantc572a475e7cd8d4f931990ba0070c06aaadd137f952d8845c73abb8f4737643e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Integral/Variantc572a475e7cd8d4f931990ba0070c06aaadd137f952d8845c73abb8f4737643e.lean#L114).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `01b5d995dab9d0f313828b9209e3cc0570a91422` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
