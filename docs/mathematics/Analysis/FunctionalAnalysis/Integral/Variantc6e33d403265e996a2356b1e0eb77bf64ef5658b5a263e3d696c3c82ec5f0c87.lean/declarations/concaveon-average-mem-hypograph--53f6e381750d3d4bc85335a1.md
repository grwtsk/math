## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:24ceef06-f942-9e00-8088-e65e2245e0d9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 122–133.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- **Jensen's inequality**: if a function `g : E → ℝ` is convex and continuous on a convex closed
set `s`, `μ` is a finite non-zero measure on `α`, and `f : α → E` is a function sending
`μ`-a.e. points to `s`, then the value of `g` at the average value of `f` is less than or equal to
the average value of `g ∘ f` provided that both `f` and `g ∘ f` are integrable. See also
`ConvexOn.map_centerMass_le` for a finite sum version of this lemma. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Integral/Variantc6e33d403265e996a2356b1e0eb77bf64ef5658b5a263e3d696c3c82ec5f0c87.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Integral/Variantc6e33d403265e996a2356b1e0eb77bf64ef5658b5a263e3d696c3c82ec5f0c87.lean#L122).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `de15c908b578721ddf0bfe14d10627b393b68ba5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
