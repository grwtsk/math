## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:36c38d831e08d6b8b0fb8a9e070752a8f4c8c966b3a41af070e3eaf4a6668491`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 31–38.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure ProtectedProjector (V : Type*) [NormedAddCommGroup V]
    [InnerProductSpace 𝕜 V] [CompleteSpace V] where
  /-- The continuous projection onto the protected sector in the declared metric. -/
  projection : V →L[𝕜] V
  idempotent : projection.comp projection = projection
  selfAdjoint : IsSelfAdjoint projection

/-- The complementary orthogonal projection uses the same metric and carrier. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/QuantitativeGap/Variant3aee7b46bbb7ef92f78345ceaba0ada479b9f4f83c0d8a51113142ae07aa171f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/QuantitativeGap/Variant3aee7b46bbb7ef92f78345ceaba0ada479b9f4f83c0d8a51113142ae07aa171f.lean#L31).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e0a62295f3eba08c1039e0bd391242348710045f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
