## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:526bf948-d238-d5bf-394f-21d9e869590b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 45–53.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem convexOn_norm (hs : Convex ℝ s) : ConvexOn ℝ s norm :=
  ⟨hs, fun x _ y _ a b ha hb _ =>
    calc
      ‖a • x + b • y‖ ≤ ‖a • x‖ + ‖b • y‖ := norm_add_le _ _
      _ = a * ‖x‖ + b * ‖y‖ := by
        rw [norm_smul, norm_smul, Real.norm_of_nonneg ha, Real.norm_of_nonneg hb]⟩

/-- The norm on a real normed space is convex on the whole space. See also `Seminorm.convexOn`
and `convexOn_norm`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Convex/Variant0f6df5c61e1665867919dc6d6df6cf9e5bb9195c2e914ce51362084a3e495c92.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Convex/Variant0f6df5c61e1665867919dc6d6df6cf9e5bb9195c2e914ce51362084a3e495c92.lean#L45).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `00bb83c8b79f98b208faeb26f80cc92dfa2b5b93` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
