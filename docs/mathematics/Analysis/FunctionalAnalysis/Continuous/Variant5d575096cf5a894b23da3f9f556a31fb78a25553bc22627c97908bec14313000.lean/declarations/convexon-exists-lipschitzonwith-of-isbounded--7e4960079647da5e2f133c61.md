## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:311aa249-a8f6-c838-d346-aadcd8a51cff`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 83–91.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma ConvexOn.exists_lipschitzOnWith_of_isBounded (hf : ConvexOn ℝ (ball x₀ r) f) (hr : r' < r)
    (hf' : IsBounded (f '' ball x₀ r)) : ∃ K, LipschitzOnWith K f (ball x₀ r') := by
  rw [isBounded_iff_subset_ball 0] at hf'
  simp only [Set.subset_def, mem_image, mem_ball, dist_zero_right, Real.norm_eq_abs,
    forall_exists_index, and_imp, forall_apply_eq_imp_iff₂] at hf'
  obtain ⟨M, hM⟩ := hf'
  rw [← sub_sub_cancel r r']
  exact ⟨_, hf.lipschitzOnWith_of_abs_le (sub_pos.2 hr) fun a ha ↦ (hM a ha).le⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Continuous/Variant5d575096cf5a894b23da3f9f556a31fb78a25553bc22627c97908bec14313000.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Continuous/Variant5d575096cf5a894b23da3f9f556a31fb78a25553bc22627c97908bec14313000.lean#L83).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e436ad9b2677486583a0924486a1323593bea052` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
