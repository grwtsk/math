## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8fec6d95-a5ba-ab68-2162-834713f9f464`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 340–350.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem norm_orthogonalRemainder_le (x z : H) (hx : ‖x‖ = 1) :
    ‖ProjectiveFubiniStudy.orthogonalRemainder x z‖ ≤ ‖z‖ := by
  have hsquare := ProjectiveFubiniStudy.norm_orthogonalRemainder_sq x z hx
  nlinarith [sq_nonneg ‖inner ℂ x z‖,
    norm_nonneg (ProjectiveFubiniStudy.orthogonalRemainder x z), norm_nonneg z]

/--
Projecting the perturbed eigen-equation onto `x⊥` gives the exact reduced
residual.  No contour integral is needed in the rank-one case.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/ProjectivePerturbation/Variant6b6e21c19f965c9daa48cdab4aa6428b8ca6f97026c4b615bbe2e239d6b14f83.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/ProjectivePerturbation/Variant6b6e21c19f965c9daa48cdab4aa6428b8ca6f97026c4b615bbe2e239d6b14f83.lean#L340).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `de1b6533ca5944bc38e85eb0e1f5bd351911ce5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
