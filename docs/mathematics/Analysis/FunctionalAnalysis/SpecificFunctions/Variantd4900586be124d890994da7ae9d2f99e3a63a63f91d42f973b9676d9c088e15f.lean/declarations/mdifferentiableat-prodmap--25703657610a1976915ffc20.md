## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8b4dfc54-99c8-2337-ad69-9c298442e560`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 434–445.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem MDifferentiableAt.prodMap (hf : MDifferentiableAt I I' f x)
    (hg : MDifferentiableAt J J' g y) :
    MDifferentiableAt (I.prod J) (I'.prod J') (Prod.map f g) (x, y) := by
  rw [← mdifferentiableWithinAt_univ] at *
  convert hf.prodMap hg
  exact univ_prod_univ.symm

@[deprecated (since := "2025-04-18")]
alias MDifferentiableAt.prod_map := MDifferentiableAt.prodMap

/-- Variant of `MDifferentiableAt.prod_map` in which the point in the product is given as `p`
instead of a pair `(x, y)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/SpecificFunctions/Variantd4900586be124d890994da7ae9d2f99e3a63a63f91d42f973b9676d9c088e15f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/SpecificFunctions/Variantd4900586be124d890994da7ae9d2f99e3a63a63f91d42f973b9676d9c088e15f.lean#L434).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7d353138d12b89e2a4db173667c1e49432171dc7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
