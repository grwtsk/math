## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:05260a6b-22bd-3c5c-ca75-89dc0dfd9a11`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 79–86.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_lt_of_gauge_lt (absorbs : Absorbent ℝ s) (h : gauge s x < a) :
    ∃ b, 0 < b ∧ b < a ∧ x ∈ b • s := by
  obtain ⟨b, ⟨hb, hx⟩, hba⟩ := exists_lt_of_csInf_lt absorbs.gauge_set_nonempty h
  exact ⟨b, hb, hba, hx⟩

/-- The gauge evaluated at `0` is always zero (mathematically this requires `0` to be in the set `s`
but, the real infimum of the empty set in Lean being defined as `0`, it holds unconditionally). -/
@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Gauge/Variantde3b213cccf4feb3df7a528a052164d751aad33f9f4fdcf9458954d0732ca682.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Gauge/Variantde3b213cccf4feb3df7a528a052164d751aad33f9f4fdcf9458954d0732ca682.lean#L79).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `49c3a1f3e957a4dc8668df1f4f4e31e793690624` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
