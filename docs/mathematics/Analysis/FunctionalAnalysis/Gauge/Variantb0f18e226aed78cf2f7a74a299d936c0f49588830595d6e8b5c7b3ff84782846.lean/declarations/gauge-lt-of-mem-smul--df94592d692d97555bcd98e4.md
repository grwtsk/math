## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:349bf47b-64dc-d136-8f22-c0b9d946d65b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 414–420.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem gauge_lt_of_mem_smul (x : E) (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε) (hs₂ : IsOpen s) (hx : x ∈ ε • s) :
    gauge s x < ε := by
  have : ε⁻¹ • x ∈ s := by rwa [← mem_smul_set_iff_inv_smul_mem₀ hε.ne']
  have h_gauge_lt := gauge_lt_one_of_mem_of_isOpen hs₂ this
  rwa [gauge_smul_of_nonneg (inv_nonneg.2 hε.le), smul_eq_mul, inv_mul_lt_iff₀ hε, mul_one]
    at h_gauge_lt

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Gauge/Variantb0f18e226aed78cf2f7a74a299d936c0f49588830595d6e8b5c7b3ff84782846.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Gauge/Variantb0f18e226aed78cf2f7a74a299d936c0f49588830595d6e8b5c7b3ff84782846.lean#L414).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `415db982bc4a48c22e0df9c86eb1e74e69a417a7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
