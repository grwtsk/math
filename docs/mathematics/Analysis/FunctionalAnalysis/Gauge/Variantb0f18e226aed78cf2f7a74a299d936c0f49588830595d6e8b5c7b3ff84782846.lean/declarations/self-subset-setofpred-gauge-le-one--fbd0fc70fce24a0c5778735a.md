## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:badf1cac-115f-2859-80d7-fede40ebdffc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 228–236.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem self_subset_setOfPred_gauge_le_one : s ⊆ { x | gauge s x ≤ 1 } :=
  fun _ => gauge_le_one_of_mem

@[deprecated (since := "2026-07-09")]
alias self_subset_setOf_gauge_le_one := self_subset_setOfPred_gauge_le_one

@[deprecated (since := "2026-06-17")]
alias self_subset_gauge_le_one := self_subset_setOfPred_gauge_le_one

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Gauge/Variantb0f18e226aed78cf2f7a74a299d936c0f49588830595d6e8b5c7b3ff84782846.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Gauge/Variantb0f18e226aed78cf2f7a74a299d936c0f49588830595d6e8b5c7b3ff84782846.lean#L228).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
