## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:995b285da8a66c185d758803da5c205ce801f1e0ab39e5bb869b6c95e7724f3a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 107–114.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instModule [IsTopologicalAddGroup F] [ContinuousConstSMul 𝕜 F] : Module 𝕜 (E →WOT[𝕜] F) :=
  inferInstanceAs <| Module 𝕜 (E →L[𝕜] F)

variable (𝕜) (E) (F) [IsTopologicalAddGroup F] [ContinuousConstSMul 𝕜 F]

unseal ContinuousLinearMapWOT in
/-- The linear equivalence that sends a continuous linear map to the type copy endowed with the
weak operator topology. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/WeakOperatorTopology/Variant90d331a49c5d80b768f73ac80c81bb4bcd9167679e450780d8d2d913e40a9d9e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/WeakOperatorTopology/Variant90d331a49c5d80b768f73ac80c81bb4bcd9167679e450780d8d2d913e40a9d9e.lean#L107).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4bd693bab61ae686a5b6fcd17bea90aaf072a09` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
