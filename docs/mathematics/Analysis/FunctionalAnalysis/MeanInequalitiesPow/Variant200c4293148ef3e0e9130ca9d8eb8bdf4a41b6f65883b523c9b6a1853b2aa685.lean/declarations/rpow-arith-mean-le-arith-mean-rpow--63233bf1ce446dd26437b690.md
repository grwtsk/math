## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c5fda3d9-a08c-8c29-0089-d5d33c1d7c33`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 81–85.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rpow_arith_mean_le_arith_mean_rpow (w z : ι → ℝ) (hw : ∀ i ∈ s, 0 ≤ w i)
    (hw' : ∑ i ∈ s, w i = 1) (hz : ∀ i ∈ s, 0 ≤ z i) {p : ℝ} (hp : 1 ≤ p) :
    (∑ i ∈ s, w i * z i) ^ p ≤ ∑ i ∈ s, w i * z i ^ p :=
  (convexOn_rpow hp).map_sum_le hw hw' hz

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/MeanInequalitiesPow/Variant200c4293148ef3e0e9130ca9d8eb8bdf4a41b6f65883b523c9b6a1853b2aa685.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/MeanInequalitiesPow/Variant200c4293148ef3e0e9130ca9d8eb8bdf4a41b6f65883b523c9b6a1853b2aa685.lean#L81).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `294c1d799ca703d41365f8e9ec8e80f149f64adc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
