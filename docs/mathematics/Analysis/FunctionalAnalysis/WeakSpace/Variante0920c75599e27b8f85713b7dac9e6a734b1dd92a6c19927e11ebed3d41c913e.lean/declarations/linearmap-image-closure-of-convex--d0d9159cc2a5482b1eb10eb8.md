## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c10e9ffd-3e41-beaa-377e-510c7a2f7c67`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 58–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem LinearMap.image_closure_of_convex {s : Set E} (hs : Convex ℝ s) (e : E →ₗ[𝕜] F)
    (he : ∀ f : F →L[𝕜] 𝕜, Continuous (e.dualMap f)) :
    e '' (closure s) ⊆ closure (e '' s) := by
  suffices he' : Continuous (toWeakSpace 𝕜 F <| e <| (toWeakSpace 𝕜 E).symm ·) by
    have h_convex : Convex ℝ (e '' s) := hs.linear_image (F := F) e
    rw [← Set.image_subset_image_iff (toWeakSpace 𝕜 F).injective, h_convex.toWeakSpace_closure 𝕜]
    simpa only [Set.image_image, ← hs.toWeakSpace_closure 𝕜, LinearEquiv.symm_apply_apply]

  exact WeakBilin.continuous_of_continuous_eval _ fun f ↦
    WeakBilin.eval_continuous _ { toLinearMap := e.dualMap f : E →L[𝕜] 𝕜 }

/-- If `e` is a linear isomorphism between two locally convex spaces, and `e` induces (via
precomposition) an isomorphism between their continuous duals, then `e` commutes with the closure
on convex sets.

The hypotheses hold automatically for `e := toWeakSpace 𝕜 E`, see `Convex.toWeakSpace_closure`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/WeakSpace/Variante0920c75599e27b8f85713b7dac9e6a734b1dd92a6c19927e11ebed3d41c913e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/WeakSpace/Variante0920c75599e27b8f85713b7dac9e6a734b1dd92a6c19927e11ebed3d41c913e.lean#L58).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `397acc525e32fcf3df7560fc107e8ad3d20b8cd5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
