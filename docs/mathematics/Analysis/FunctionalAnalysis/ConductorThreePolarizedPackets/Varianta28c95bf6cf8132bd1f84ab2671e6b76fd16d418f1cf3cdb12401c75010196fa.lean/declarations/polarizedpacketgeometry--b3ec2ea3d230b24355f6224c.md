## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:621751fae438776e841a63def8f70596dee11cd0e58e3f252e89ec2f212f7d70`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 139–156.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure PolarizedPacketGeometry
    (configuration : PolarizedArithmeticPacketConfiguration) where
  Packet : Type
  instDecidableEq : DecidableEq Packet
  family : @Surface.Core.PrimeWalkWangZahlGeometry.EuclideanShadedTubeFamily
    Packet instDecidableEq
  tubes_nonempty : family.tubes.Nonempty
  scale_eq : family.delta = configuration.geometricScale
  wolffConstant : ℝ≥0∞
  convexWolff :
    Surface.Core.PrimeWalkWangZahlGeometry.KatzTaoConvexWolffAtMost
      family wolffConstant

/-- Geometric admissibility means that concrete unsigned Wang--Zahl data have
actually been constructed.  Packet-frame localization, `TT*`, two-scale
grain control, and signed off-diagonal estimates remain theorem obligations
of the large-sieve proof rather than fields of this certificate. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/ConductorThreePolarizedPackets/Varianta28c95bf6cf8132bd1f84ab2671e6b76fd16d418f1cf3cdb12401c75010196fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/ConductorThreePolarizedPackets/Varianta28c95bf6cf8132bd1f84ab2671e6b76fd16d418f1cf3cdb12401c75010196fa.lean#L139).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dc8325454371224c9cffb497aaa4363294cc366d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
