## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4ee4b50133ea52893c3cb42e9a18032588430b7e9e2ba87e2413884690f02779`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 69–74.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev continuousLinearMapOfTendsto {α : Type*} [CompleteSpace E] [T2Space F] {l : Filter α}
    [l.IsCountablyGenerated] [l.NeBot] (g : α → E →SL[σ₁₂] F) {f : E → F}
    (h : Tendsto (fun n x ↦ g n x) l (𝓝 f)) :
    E →SL[σ₁₂] F :=
  (norm_withSeminorms 𝕜₂ F).continuousLinearMapOfTendsto g h
#align continuous_linear_map_of_tendsto continuousLinearMapOfTendsto
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSteinhaus/Varianta9f574c28e7de9e8e528e5bcc41889f91fedb48b796e9a553904b56359de2f36.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSteinhaus/Varianta9f574c28e7de9e8e528e5bcc41889f91fedb48b796e9a553904b56359de2f36.lean#L69).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e047a4e078270c518b2c1d1e2da5c8ec733cfc8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
