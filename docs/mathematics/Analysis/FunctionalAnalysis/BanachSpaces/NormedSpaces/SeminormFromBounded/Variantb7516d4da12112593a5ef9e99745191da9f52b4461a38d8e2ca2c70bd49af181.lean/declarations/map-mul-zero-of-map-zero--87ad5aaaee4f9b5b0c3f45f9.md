## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a8b67ebc-891e-422e-7019-88039b93b504`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 86–92.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_mul_zero_of_map_zero (f_nonneg : 0 ≤ f)
    (f_mul : ∀ x y : R, f (x * y) ≤ c * f x * f y) {x : R} (hx : f x = 0)
    (y : R) : f (x * y) = 0 := by
  replace f_mul : f (x * y) ≤ 0 := by simpa [hx] using f_mul x y
  exact le_antisymm f_mul (f_nonneg _)

/-- `seminormFromBounded' f` preserves `0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/SeminormFromBounded/Variantb7516d4da12112593a5ef9e99745191da9f52b4461a38d8e2ca2c70bd49af181.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/SeminormFromBounded/Variantb7516d4da12112593a5ef9e99745191da9f52b4461a38d8e2ca2c70bd49af181.lean#L86).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fa0531987e900b40adafdf9149a529c2a2dafdbe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
