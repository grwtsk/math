## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3eac799de9a39aa3b0ac5c64d893e2bcfd434d070465ecb1de864cd6ae1f397c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 236–248.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def toConstProdContinuousLinearMap : (V →ᴬ[𝕜] W) ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜] W × (V →L[𝕜] W) where
  toFun f := ⟨f 0, f.contLinear⟩
  invFun p := p.2.toContinuousAffineMap + const 𝕜 V p.1
  left_inv f := by
    ext
    rw [f.decomp]
    simp only [coe_add, ContinuousLinearMap.coe_toContinuousAffineMap, Pi.add_apply, coe_const]

  norm_map' _ := rfl

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/ContinuousAffineMap/Variantfac0bd059e3e2badcb18bb030fa6fa65669219a4806d2ebcf067861819c5a9b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/ContinuousAffineMap/Variantfac0bd059e3e2badcb18bb030fa6fa65669219a4806d2ebcf067861819c5a9b9.lean#L236).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e1ee3c37d614e9ef13ac23d89f160671c0f063d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
