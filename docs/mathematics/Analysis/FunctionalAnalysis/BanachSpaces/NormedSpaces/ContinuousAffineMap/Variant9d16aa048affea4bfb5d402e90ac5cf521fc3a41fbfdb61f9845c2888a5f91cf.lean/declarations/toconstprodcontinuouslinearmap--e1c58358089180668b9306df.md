## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4700000fb7a9e1e47176f3242c71193df010904bf6a32e1aa492c325ba99db22`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 244–256.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def toConstProdContinuousLinearMap : (V →ᴬ[𝕜] W) ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜] W × (V →L[𝕜] W) where
  toFun f := ⟨f 0, f.contLinear⟩
  invFun p := p.2.toContinuousAffineMap + const 𝕜 V p.1
  left_inv f := by
    ext
    rw [f.decomp]
    simp only [coe_add, ContinuousLinearMap.coe_toContinuousAffineMap, Pi.add_apply, coe_const]
  right_inv := by rintro ⟨v, f⟩; ext <;> simp
  map_add' _ _ := rfl
  map_smul' _ _ := rfl
  norm_map' _ := rfl

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/ContinuousAffineMap/Variant9d16aa048affea4bfb5d402e90ac5cf521fc3a41fbfdb61f9845c2888a5f91cf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/ContinuousAffineMap/Variant9d16aa048affea4bfb5d402e90ac5cf521fc3a41fbfdb61f9845c2888a5f91cf.lean#L244).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `db5697e0496865bdde593d353024764a672c71b9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
