## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2c73645f07da32387a596a117c6021c1f603b9f74fdfeaebcaecbaa34aaa369b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 341–355.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev NormedField.induced [Field R] [NormedField S] [NonUnitalRingHomClass F R S] (f : F)
    (hf : Function.Injective f) : NormedField R :=
  fast_instance% { NormedDivisionRing.induced R S f hf with
    mul_comm := mul_comm }

end Induced

namespace SubfieldClass

variable {S F : Type*} [SetLike S F]

/--
If `s` is a subfield of a normed field `F`, then `s` is equipped with an induced normed
field structure.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant613a9c9fb6f2b6d4d517fa2b09b6ec59c6a1b78f402d72c7b8e3be85082241ba.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant613a9c9fb6f2b6d4d517fa2b09b6ec59c6a1b78f402d72c7b8e3be85082241ba.lean#L341).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dc7cd6d1b9d57f6965c8aa0ee3e4c2f8b95db6ac` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
