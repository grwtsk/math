## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2612803992706c07c93b4468884be92328feea33652922ef3bbd1354f3fa5c2a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 159–167.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class NormedField (α : Type*) extends Norm α, Field α, MetricSpace α where
  /-- The distance is induced by the norm. -/
  dist_eq : ∀ x y, dist x y = norm (x - y)
  /-- The norm is multiplicative. -/
  protected norm_mul : ∀ a b, norm (a * b) = norm a * norm b

/-- A nontrivially normed field is a normed field in which there is an element of norm different
from `0` and `1`. This makes it possible to bring any element arbitrarily close to `0` by
multiplication by the powers of any element, and thus to relate algebra and topology. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant9bf406490630aecec9ed32fd839534e0c1ca86cf08dc975342218cef11c843df.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant9bf406490630aecec9ed32fd839534e0c1ca86cf08dc975342218cef11c843df.lean#L159).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d6307c27cbd0c61b1ba19aafbd4c69cdc1a5a660` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
