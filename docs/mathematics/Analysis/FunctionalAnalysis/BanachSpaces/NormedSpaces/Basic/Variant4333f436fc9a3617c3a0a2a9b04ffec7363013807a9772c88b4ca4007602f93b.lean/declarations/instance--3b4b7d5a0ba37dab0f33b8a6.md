## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1c72c1e478ba105c94faf4aaa0aed7249ca4b0a47fb78c591f17f65fdf55e667`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 523–528.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance {𝕜 : Type*} {𝕜' : Type*} {E : Type*} [I : NormedAddCommGroup E] :
    NormedAddCommGroup (RestrictScalars 𝕜 𝕜' E) :=
  I

/-- If `E` is a normed space over `𝕜'` and `𝕜` is a normed algebra over `𝕜'`, then
`RestrictScalars.module` is additionally a `NormedSpace`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant4333f436fc9a3617c3a0a2a9b04ffec7363013807a9772c88b4ca4007602f93b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant4333f436fc9a3617c3a0a2a9b04ffec7363013807a9772c88b4ca4007602f93b.lean#L523).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a769baec052fefdfb172eaa92c85cfb7d9cfbe84` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
