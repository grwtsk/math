## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c0ef4e4dd9dc6cfc09912b86fc6c888be00ac65d2b2cad9ee20feb7e2946f7e7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 63–77.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure VonNeumannAlgebra (H : Type u) [NormedAddCommGroup H] [InnerProductSpace ℂ H]
    [CompleteSpace H] extends StarSubalgebra ℂ (H →L[ℂ] H) where
  /-- The double commutant (a.k.a. centralizer) of a `VonNeumannAlgebra` is itself. -/
  centralizer_centralizer' : Set.centralizer (Set.centralizer carrier) = carrier

/-- Consider a von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space `H` as a *-subalgebra of `H →L[ℂ] H`.
(That is, we forget that it is equal to its double commutant
or equivalently that it is closed in the weak and strong operator topologies.)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant6cb3cdfc0cf4e2fd1cd725f49ddde12b41a33c8f878a5850738d39e73116d32a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant6cb3cdfc0cf4e2fd1cd725f49ddde12b41a33c8f878a5850738d39e73116d32a.lean#L63).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ebfb6148b0f46e299a652583fb79c966f384608c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
