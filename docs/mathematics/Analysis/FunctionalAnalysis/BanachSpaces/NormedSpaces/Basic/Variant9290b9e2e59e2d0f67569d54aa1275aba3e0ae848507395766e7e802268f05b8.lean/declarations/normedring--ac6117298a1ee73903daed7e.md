## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b769196a8b9afbbdbc4ca1e9d93bc1afcee19e5b56cd95645dc20420c94d7fec`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 77–85.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class NormedRing (α : Type*) extends Norm α, Ring α, MetricSpace α where
  /-- The distance is induced by the norm. -/
  dist_eq : ∀ x y, dist x y = norm (x - y)
  /-- The norm is submultiplicative. -/
  norm_mul : ∀ a b, norm (a * b) ≤ norm a * norm b
#align normed_ring NormedRing

/-- A normed division ring is a division ring endowed with a seminorm which satisfies the equality
`‖x y‖ = ‖x‖ ‖y‖`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant9290b9e2e59e2d0f67569d54aa1275aba3e0ae848507395766e7e802268f05b8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant9290b9e2e59e2d0f67569d54aa1275aba3e0ae848507395766e7e802268f05b8.lean#L77).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0b1fcacdbcbe6c60584386ee3203319d994d056f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
