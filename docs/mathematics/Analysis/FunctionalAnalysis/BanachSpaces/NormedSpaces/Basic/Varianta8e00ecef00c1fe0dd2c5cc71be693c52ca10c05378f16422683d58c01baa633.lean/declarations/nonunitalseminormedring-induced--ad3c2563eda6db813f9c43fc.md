## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:66d869d469ce6f873d167c3eea16dba4ae8a69c790a409aba677cc585ae7d667`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 770–778.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev NonUnitalSeminormedRing.induced [NonUnitalRing R] [NonUnitalSeminormedRing S]
    [NonUnitalRingHomClass F R S] (f : F) : NonUnitalSeminormedRing R :=
  { SeminormedAddCommGroup.induced R S f, ‹NonUnitalRing R› with
    norm_mul_le x y := show ‖f _‖ ≤ _ from (map_mul f x y).symm ▸ norm_mul_le (f x) (f y) }

/-- An injective non-unital ring homomorphism from a `NonUnitalRing` to a
`NonUnitalNormedRing` induces a `NonUnitalNormedRing` structure on the domain.

See note [reducible non-instances] -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Varianta8e00ecef00c1fe0dd2c5cc71be693c52ca10c05378f16422683d58c01baa633.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Varianta8e00ecef00c1fe0dd2c5cc71be693c52ca10c05378f16422683d58c01baa633.lean#L770).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fb12c58bb889b48632207cb0ad70f2dc46f852ea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
