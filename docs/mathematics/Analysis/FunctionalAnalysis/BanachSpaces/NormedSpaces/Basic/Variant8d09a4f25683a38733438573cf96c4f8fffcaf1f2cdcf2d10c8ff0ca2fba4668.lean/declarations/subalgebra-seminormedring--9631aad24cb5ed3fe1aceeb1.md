## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:eac21d9c84978c2cb42f6b22ff374f1fbaa1dcc591987378b3cca0b67a25cd5c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 327–335.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Subalgebra.seminormedRing {𝕜 : Type*} [CommRing 𝕜] {E : Type*} [SeminormedRing E]
    [Algebra 𝕜 E] (s : Subalgebra 𝕜 E) : SeminormedRing s :=
  { s.toSubmodule.seminormedAddCommGroup, s.toRing with
    norm_mul_le a b := norm_mul_le a.1 b.1 }

/-- A subalgebra of a seminormed ring is also a seminormed ring, with the restriction of the
norm. -/
-- necessary to require `SMulMemClass S 𝕜 E` so that `𝕜` can be determined as an `outParam`
@[nolint unusedArguments]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant8d09a4f25683a38733438573cf96c4f8fffcaf1f2cdcf2d10c8ff0ca2fba4668.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant8d09a4f25683a38733438573cf96c4f8fffcaf1f2cdcf2d10c8ff0ca2fba4668.lean#L327).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0404cc81cfcfcd097f1257410f6957dc771ee174` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
