## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `abbrev` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8561d4d7e1c7b3f09c29201d1ac3efad733ba209e61bc7014984e68fcd6d1f8b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 351–357.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
abbrev NormedAlgebra.induced {F : Type*} (𝕜 R S : Type*) [NormedField 𝕜] [Ring R] [Algebra 𝕜 R]
    [SeminormedRing S] [NormedAlgebra 𝕜 S] [FunLike F R S] [NonUnitalAlgHomClass F 𝕜 R S]
    (f : F) :
    @NormedAlgebra 𝕜 R _ (SeminormedRing.induced R S f) :=

  ⟨fun a b ↦ show ‖f (a • b)‖ ≤ ‖a‖ * ‖f b‖ from (map_smul f a b).symm ▸ norm_smul_le a (f b)⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant23b747ffe43fab18204e61f63779a797121cdb23b59d966578e8265105a49246.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant23b747ffe43fab18204e61f63779a797121cdb23b59d966578e8265105a49246.lean#L351).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6b7b64d2a6ed6dc245a1babb322492685b0c36e1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
