## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ba45e889670ddd77160a63f1763c9470c151e7cd55ad24815c05ec593c9cd724`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 367–371.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance normedAlgebraRat {𝕜} [NormedDivisionRing 𝕜] [CharZero 𝕜] [NormedAlgebra ℝ 𝕜] :
    NormedAlgebra ℚ 𝕜 where
  norm_smul_le q x := by
    rw [← smul_one_smul ℝ q x, Rat.smul_one_eq_cast, norm_smul, Rat.norm_cast_real]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant07fe5050cc0ca220ce465b2c394471632dd4ef1beab08f3333a8f6a4c707c148.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Basic/Variant07fe5050cc0ca220ce465b2c394471632dd4ef1beab08f3333a8f6a4c707c148.lean#L367).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0c70350a94ff80dd45966f2a9e6abdd5d0a629e7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
