## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cf4d44b3-72dd-abe6-2d01-ee4115c3f094`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1220–1224.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem uniformContinuous_of_forall [UniformSpace E] [UniformAddGroup E]
    {p : Seminorm 𝕝 E} (hp : ∀ r > 0, p.ball 0 r ∈ (𝓝 0 : Filter E)) :
    UniformContinuous p :=
  Seminorm.uniformContinuous_of_continuousAt_zero (continuousAt_zero_of_forall hp)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Seminorm/Variantf3bf48ff189093541052ad0c3fd109d73805c2b8d43c8420936682c0c7fcd64b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Seminorm/Variantf3bf48ff189093541052ad0c3fd109d73805c2b8d43c8420936682c0c7fcd64b.lean#L1220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c246ce3cf065b4bd87737f96aed7df768aa27fd9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
