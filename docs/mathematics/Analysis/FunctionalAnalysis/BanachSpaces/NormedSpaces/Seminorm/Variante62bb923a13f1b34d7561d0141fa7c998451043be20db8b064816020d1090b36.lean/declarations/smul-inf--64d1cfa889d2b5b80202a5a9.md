## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:83c96774-a250-32d0-1b60-793807aa7e42`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 469–493.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- We define the supremum of an arbitrary subset of `Seminorm 𝕜 E` as follows:
* if `s` is `BddAbove` *as a set of functions `E → ℝ`* (that is, if `s` is pointwise bounded
  above), we take the pointwise supremum of all elements of `s`, and we prove that it is indeed a
  seminorm.
* otherwise, we take the zero seminorm `⊥`.

There are two things worth mentioning here:
* First, it is not trivial at first that `s` being bounded above *by a function* implies
  being bounded above *as a seminorm*. We show this in `Seminorm.bddAbove_iff` by using
  that the `Sup s` as defined here is then a bounding seminorm for `s`. So it is important to make
  the case disjunction on `BddAbove ((↑) '' s : Set (E → ℝ))` and not `BddAbove s`.
* Since the pointwise `Sup` already gives `0` at points where a family of functions is
  not bounded above, one could hope that just using the pointwise `Sup` would work here, without the
  need for an additional case disjunction. As discussed on Zulip, this doesn't work because this can
  give a function which does *not* satisfy the seminorm axioms (typically sub-additivity).

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Seminorm/Variante62bb923a13f1b34d7561d0141fa7c998451043be20db8b064816020d1090b36.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Seminorm/Variante62bb923a13f1b34d7561d0141fa7c998451043be20db8b064816020d1090b36.lean#L469).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `18796d42c589e751a6c33cfa873b9e5091dfbf86` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
