## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a20c8720-636c-daa9-0835-1befd3b3cca7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1432–1439.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem balanced_ball_zero : Balanced 𝕜 (Metric.ball (0 : E) r) := by
  rw [← ball_normSeminorm 𝕜]
  exact (normSeminorm _ _).balanced_ball_zero r
#align balanced_ball_zero balanced_ball_zero

/-- If there is a scalar `c` with `‖c‖>1`, then any element with nonzero norm can be
moved by scalar multiplication to any shell of width `‖c‖`. Also recap information on the norm of
the rescaling element that shows up in applications. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Seminorm/Variant1b88939387aeb8744537f8d3b136fb3d0f661b18e35abb214a1b59b95cbdd666.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Seminorm/Variant1b88939387aeb8744537f8d3b136fb3d0f661b18e35abb214a1b59b95cbdd666.lean#L1432).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f55991f82ac638380bcf137118898403dcec9249` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
