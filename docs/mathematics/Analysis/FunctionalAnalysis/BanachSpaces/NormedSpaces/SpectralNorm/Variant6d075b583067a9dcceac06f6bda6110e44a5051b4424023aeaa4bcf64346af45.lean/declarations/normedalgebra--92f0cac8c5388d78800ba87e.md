## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:812113eba2ed5fe8624b1315e079edb6a293da24441c17ad4b01396a934d9495`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 898–912.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def normedAlgebra' (E L : Type*) [Field L] [Algebra K L] [Algebra.IsAlgebraic K L] [NormedField E]
    [NormedAlgebra K E] [Algebra E L] [IsScalarTower K E L] :
    @NormedAlgebra E L _ (seminormedRing K L) :=
  letI _ := normedField K L
  letI _ := normedAlgebra K L
  letI _ := Algebra.IsAlgebraic.tower_bot K E L
  { (inferInstance : Algebra E L) with
    norm_smul_le _ _ := by
      apply le_of_eq
      simp only [Algebra.smul_def, norm_mul, mul_eq_mul_right_iff, _root_.norm_eq_zero]
      simp only [NormedAlgebra.norm_eq_spectralNorm K]
      exact Or.inl <| (spectralNorm.eq_of_tower _).symm }

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/SpectralNorm/Variant6d075b583067a9dcceac06f6bda6110e44a5051b4424023aeaa4bcf64346af45.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/SpectralNorm/Variant6d075b583067a9dcceac06f6bda6110e44a5051b4424023aeaa4bcf64346af45.lean#L898).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `966cc62fcc2a5f696404037c9fc864e171e85938` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
