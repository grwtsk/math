## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:658248edaebfccb665f1fb7df5a7baf23b1892d2f0721906fbd745742591c15d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 266–279.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def liftIsometry : ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E F ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜] (⨂[𝕜] i, E i) →L[𝕜] F :=
  { liftEquiv 𝕜 E F with
    norm_map' := by
      intro f
      refine le_antisymm ?_ ?_
      · simp only [liftEquiv_apply]
        exact LinearMap.mkContinuous_norm_le _ (norm_nonneg f) _
      · conv_lhs => rw [← (liftEquiv 𝕜 E F).symm_apply_apply f]
        rw [liftEquiv_symm_apply]
        exact MultilinearMap.mkContinuous_norm_le _ (norm_nonneg _) _ }

variable {𝕜 E F}

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/InjectiveSeminorm/Variant51e564ec221edf353d68161006dfbc540785db0f40359a143a52c2a176e2cd13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/InjectiveSeminorm/Variant51e564ec221edf353d68161006dfbc540785db0f40359a143a52c2a176e2cd13.lean#L266).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c24595b665c1e32d941023a2cff6c0858f663391` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
