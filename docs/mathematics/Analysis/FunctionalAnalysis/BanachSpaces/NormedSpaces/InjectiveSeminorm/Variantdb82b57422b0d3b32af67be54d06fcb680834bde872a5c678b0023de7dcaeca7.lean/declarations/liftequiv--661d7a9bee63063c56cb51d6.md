## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c9652e1eeca6cfef864c1e9ee62e52049f6bd03e789cec43c739d61ac05344c9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 249–273.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def liftEquiv : ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E F ≃ₗ[𝕜] (⨂[𝕜] i, E i) →L[𝕜] F where
  toFun f := LinearMap.mkContinuous (lift f.toMultilinearMap) ‖f‖ fun x ↦
    norm_eval_le_injectiveSeminorm f x
  map_add' f g := by ext _; simp only [ContinuousMultilinearMap.toMultilinearMap_add, map_add,
    LinearMap.mkContinuous_apply, LinearMap.add_apply, ContinuousLinearMap.add_apply]
  map_smul' a f := by ext _; simp only [ContinuousMultilinearMap.toMultilinearMap_smul, map_smul,
    LinearMap.mkContinuous_apply, LinearMap.smul_apply, RingHom.id_apply,
    ContinuousLinearMap.coe_smul', Pi.smul_apply]
  invFun l := MultilinearMap.mkContinuous (lift.symm l.toLinearMap) ‖l‖ fun x ↦ by
    simp only [lift_symm, LinearMap.compMultilinearMap_apply, ContinuousLinearMap.coe_coe]
    exact ContinuousLinearMap.le_opNorm_of_le _ (injectiveSeminorm_tprod_le x)
  left_inv f := by ext x; simp only [LinearMap.mkContinuous_coe, LinearEquiv.symm_apply_apply,
      MultilinearMap.coe_mkContinuous, ContinuousMultilinearMap.coe_coe]
  right_inv l := by
    rw [← ContinuousLinearMap.coe_inj]
    apply PiTensorProduct.ext; ext m
    simp only [lift_symm, LinearMap.mkContinuous_coe, LinearMap.compMultilinearMap_apply,
      lift.tprod, ContinuousMultilinearMap.coe_coe, MultilinearMap.coe_mkContinuous,
      ContinuousLinearMap.coe_coe]

/-- For a normed space `F`, we have constructed in `PiTensorProduct.liftEquiv` the canonical
linear equivalence between `ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 E F` and `(⨂[𝕜] i, Eᵢ) →L[𝕜] F`
(induced by `PiTensorProduct.lift`). Here we give the upgrade of this equivalence to
an isometric linear equivalence; in particular, it is a continuous linear equivalence.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/InjectiveSeminorm/Variantdb82b57422b0d3b32af67be54d06fcb680834bde872a5c678b0023de7dcaeca7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/InjectiveSeminorm/Variantdb82b57422b0d3b32af67be54d06fcb680834bde872a5c678b0023de7dcaeca7.lean#L249).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ddd10e61202f69053042a811269c8d34d3b7b161` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
