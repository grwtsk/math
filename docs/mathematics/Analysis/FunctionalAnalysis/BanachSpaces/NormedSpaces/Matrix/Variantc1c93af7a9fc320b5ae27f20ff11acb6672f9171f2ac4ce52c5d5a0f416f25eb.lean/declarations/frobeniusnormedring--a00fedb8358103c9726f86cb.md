## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fc8fda7ab7e1c5f9a0a4542a07ad3fab7dc211089d127af763cdf21f96f67526`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 656–665.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def frobeniusNormedRing [DecidableEq m] : NormedRing (Matrix m m α) :=
  { Matrix.frobeniusSeminormedAddCommGroup, Matrix.instRing with
    norm := Norm.norm
    norm_mul_le := frobenius_norm_mul
    eq_of_dist_eq_zero := eq_of_dist_eq_zero }

/-- Normed algebra instance (using the Frobenius norm) for matrices over `ℝ` or `ℂ`.  Not
declared as an instance because there are several natural choices for defining the norm of a
matrix. -/
@[local instance]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Matrix/Variantc1c93af7a9fc320b5ae27f20ff11acb6672f9171f2ac4ce52c5d5a0f416f25eb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/Matrix/Variantc1c93af7a9fc320b5ae27f20ff11acb6672f9171f2ac4ce52c5d5a0f416f25eb.lean#L656).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `43851faa4812b43b4ae3c354af18322e12475e31` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
