## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:421d2e68d57647a8f09d1eb9a775a7fa0d3a28ea6ecb7a400fca0528264b6348`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 287–298.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def algNormFromConst {k : K} {g : AlgebraNorm F K} (hg_k : g k ≠ 0) (hg_pm : IsPowMul g) :
    AlgebraNorm F K where
  __ := normFromConst hg_k hg_pm
  smul' x y := by
    have hx : g (algebraMap F K x) = ‖x‖ := by
      have hg1 : g 1 = 1 := by simpa [map_ne_zero_iff_ne_zero, sq] using hg_pm 1 one_le_two
      rw [Algebra.algebraMap_eq_smul_one, map_smul_eq_mul, hg1, mul_one]
    have hy y : g (algebraMap F K x * y) = g (algebraMap F K x) * g y := by
      rw [← Algebra.smul_def, map_smul_eq_mul, hx]
    simp [Algebra.smul_def, seminormFromConst_isMul_of_isMul hg_k hg_pm hy y,
      seminormFromConst_apply_of_isMul hg_k hg_pm hy, hx]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/SeminormFromConst/Variantb085ce1fc384940fae906867cc5900b16be3132712045a3c14455c1ed14bf2c0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BanachSpaces/NormedSpaces/SeminormFromConst/Variantb085ce1fc384940fae906867cc5900b16be3132712045a3c14455c1ed14bf2c0.lean#L287).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a32ad2541890ea991858f572341df3c23b9e3050` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
