## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:400f4c8c66241e2e46a460cbb504952074324e0f53bf7c70f3cee77102ad650f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 334–378.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  target := { z : EuclideanHalfSpace 1 | z.val 0 < y - x }
  toFun z := ⟨fun _ => y - z.val, sub_nonneg.mpr z.property.2⟩

    have B : Continuous fun z : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1) => z 0 := continuous_apply 0
    exact (A.comp B).comp continuous_subtype_val

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Real/Variante37c1c8ae42495ce3ce410727047a863d9c9f50409b9607564e1a3edf1fc7b41.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Real/Variante37c1c8ae42495ce3ce410727047a863d9c9f50409b9607564e1a3edf1fc7b41.lean#L334).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
