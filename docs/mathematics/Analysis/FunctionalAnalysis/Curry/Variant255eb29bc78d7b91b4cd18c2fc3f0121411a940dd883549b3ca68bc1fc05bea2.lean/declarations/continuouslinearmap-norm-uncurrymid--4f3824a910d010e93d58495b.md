## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6f263ce9-98f5-ae2b-6ae2-0bbca8cee924`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 402–419.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (f : Ei p →L[𝕜] ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 (fun i ↦ Ei (p.succAbove i)) G) :

#### Currying with `0` variables

The space of multilinear maps with `0` variables is trivial: such a multilinear map is just an
arbitrary constant (note that multilinear maps in `0` variables need not map `0` to `0`!).
Therefore, the space of continuous multilinear maps on `(Fin 0) → G` with values in `E₂` is
isomorphic (and even isometric) to `E₂`. As this is the zeroth step in the construction of iterated
derivatives, we register this isomorphism. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Curry/Variant255eb29bc78d7b91b4cd18c2fc3f0121411a940dd883549b3ca68bc1fc05bea2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Curry/Variant255eb29bc78d7b91b4cd18c2fc3f0121411a940dd883549b3ca68bc1fc05bea2.lean#L402).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `faaf32542a0d4c2e5cd4176011b19d72f8909120` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
