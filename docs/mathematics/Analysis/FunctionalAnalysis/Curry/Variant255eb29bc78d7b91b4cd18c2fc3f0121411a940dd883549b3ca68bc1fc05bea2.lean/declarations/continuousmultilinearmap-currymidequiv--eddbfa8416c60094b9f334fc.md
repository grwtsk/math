## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a6e81e3b4f61a0696da2ba5b35c71138b75d4b8ea9fcd666a92a13f1f4002ccb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 379–396.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ContinuousMultilinearMap.curryMidEquiv (p : Fin (n + 1)) :
    ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 Ei G ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜]
      Ei p →L[𝕜] ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 (fun i ↦ Ei (p.succAbove i)) G :=
  LinearIsometryEquiv.ofBounds
    { toFun := ContinuousMultilinearMap.curryMid p
      map_add' := fun _ _ => rfl
      map_smul' := fun _ _ => rfl
      invFun := ContinuousLinearMap.uncurryMid p
      left_inv := ContinuousMultilinearMap.uncurryMid_curryMid p
      right_inv := ContinuousLinearMap.curryMid_uncurryMid p }
    (fun f => by dsimp; exact MultilinearMap.mkContinuousLinear_norm_le _ (norm_nonneg f) _)
    (fun f => by
      simp only [LinearEquiv.coe_symm_mk]
      exact MultilinearMap.mkContinuous_norm_le _ (norm_nonneg f) _)

variable {𝕜 Ei G}

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Curry/Variant255eb29bc78d7b91b4cd18c2fc3f0121411a940dd883549b3ca68bc1fc05bea2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Curry/Variant255eb29bc78d7b91b4cd18c2fc3f0121411a940dd883549b3ca68bc1fc05bea2.lean#L379).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `faaf32542a0d4c2e5cd4176011b19d72f8909120` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
