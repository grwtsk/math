## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c8be816bf57acc5f638369ea9c5484d3a43303d55d5742d9b408e2e20e241a95`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 539–553.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def domDomCongrₗᵢ (σ : ι ≃ ι') :
    ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 (fun _ : ι => G) G' ≃ₗᵢ[𝕜]
      ContinuousMultilinearMap 𝕜 (fun _ : ι' => G) G' :=
  { domDomCongrEquiv σ with
    map_add' := fun _ _ => rfl
    map_smul' := fun _ _ => rfl
    norm_map' := norm_domDomCongr 𝕜 G G' σ }

variable {𝕜 G G'}

section

/-- A continuous multilinear map with variables indexed by `ι ⊕ ι'` defines a continuous
multilinear map with variables indexed by `ι` taking values in the space of continuous multilinear
maps with variables indexed by `ι'`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Curry/Variant4f2080a1c3399e6ac188efe31c71dde2f337e24d2ddc3ceff3306a96ece5bea0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Curry/Variant4f2080a1c3399e6ac188efe31c71dde2f337e24d2ddc3ceff3306a96ece5bea0.lean#L539).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ee4c496966c7933f0c9ba0b6d2783f0133814fdf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
