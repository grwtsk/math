## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0d8f79593cdd7daab5bf12fd1a58789b4d1a085f4fc68bc36be7ffe4df72ed34`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 641–662.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

def smulLeft : G →* M₁ ≃L[R₁] M₁ where
  toFun g := ⟨DistribMulAction.toModuleAut _ _ g, continuous_const_smul _, continuous_const_smul _⟩
  map_mul' _ _ := toLinearEquiv_injective <| map_mul (DistribMulAction.toModuleAut _ _) _ _
  map_one' := toLinearEquiv_injective <| map_one <| DistribMulAction.toModuleAut _ _

### Automorphisms as continuous linear equivalences and as units of the ring of endomorphisms

The next theorems cover the identification between `M ≃L[R] M`and the group of units of the ring
`M →L[R] M`.

/-- An invertible continuous linear map `f` determines a continuous equivalence from `M` to itself.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Equiv/Variant37180c7d3e6c299a301ccb7bdab1fbce17a2853384b31daa107803ada1dcb81b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Equiv/Variant37180c7d3e6c299a301ccb7bdab1fbce17a2853384b31daa107803ada1dcb81b.lean#L641).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3f4600b789c3da6808b2558825bdb93ea38c94fd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
