## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:97ddc2ad6a708b52b5eb9be1d48529f2b2a06980ba47b7d1cfae827a84a1c6fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 580–592.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sumPiEquivProdPi (R : Type*) [Semiring R] (S T : Type*)
    (A : S ⊕ T → Type*) [∀ st, AddCommMonoid (A st)] [∀ st, Module R (A st)]
    [∀ st, TopologicalSpace (A st)] :
    ((st : S ⊕ T) → A st) ≃L[R] ((s : S) → A (Sum.inl s)) × ((t : T) → A (Sum.inr t)) where
  __ := LinearEquiv.sumPiEquivProdPi R S T A
  __ := Homeomorph.sumPiEquivProdPi S T A

/-- The product `Π t : α, f t` of a family of topological modules is isomorphic
(both topologically and algebraically) to the space `f ⬝` when `α` only contains `⬝`.

This is `Equiv.piUnique` as a `ContinuousLinearEquiv`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Equiv/Variant3b6b72ba204e4a5c7a7d4951ebf240a124a797202b87876e0ce1ebe1a6433146.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Equiv/Variant3b6b72ba204e4a5c7a7d4951ebf240a124a797202b87876e0ce1ebe1a6433146.lean#L580).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8e1852df33d35ea430831b793e0c3133dcab7f5c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
