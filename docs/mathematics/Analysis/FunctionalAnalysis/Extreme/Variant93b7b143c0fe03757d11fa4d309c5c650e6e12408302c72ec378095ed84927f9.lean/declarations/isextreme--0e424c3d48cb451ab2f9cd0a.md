## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:907bf39127b272e42f2fffe660e8b5906388000cf4b8d0bd1488eab25beb9e06`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–59.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def IsExtreme (A B : Set E) : Prop :=
  B ⊆ A ∧ ∀ ⦃x₁⦄, x₁ ∈ A → ∀ ⦃x₂⦄, x₂ ∈ A → ∀ ⦃x⦄, x ∈ B → x ∈ openSegment 𝕜 x₁ x₂ → x₁ ∈ B ∧ x₂ ∈ B

/-- A point `x` is an extreme point of a set `A` if `x` belongs to no open segment with ends in
`A`, except for the obvious `openSegment x x`.

In order to prove that `x` is an extreme point of `A`,
it is convenient to use `mem_extremePoints_iff_left` to avoid repeating arguments twice. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Extreme/Variant93b7b143c0fe03757d11fa4d309c5c650e6e12408302c72ec378095ed84927f9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Extreme/Variant93b7b143c0fe03757d11fa4d309c5c650e6e12408302c72ec378095ed84927f9.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1534f8048721e1dfbc097d7077ee4ed9fae6301` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
