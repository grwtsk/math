## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:bb75f94c-586c-fd80-92ed-e666ae5433fa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 230–247.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma image_extremePoints (f : L) (s : Set E) :
    f '' extremePoints 𝕜 s = extremePoints 𝕜 (f '' s) := by
  ext b
  obtain ⟨a, rfl⟩ := EquivLike.surjective f b
  have : ∀ x y, f '' openSegment 𝕜 x y = openSegment 𝕜 (f x) (f y) :=
    image_openSegment _ (LinearMapClass.linearMap f).toAffineMap
  simp only [mem_extremePoints, (EquivLike.surjective f).forall,
    (EquivLike.injective f).mem_set_image, (EquivLike.injective f).eq_iff, ← this]

end OrderedRing

section LinearOrderedRing

variable [Ring 𝕜] [LinearOrder 𝕜] [IsStrictOrderedRing 𝕜] [AddCommGroup E] [Module 𝕜 E]
variable [DenselyOrdered 𝕜] [NoZeroSMulDivisors 𝕜 E] {A : Set E} {x : E}

/-- A useful restatement using `segment`: `x` is an extreme point iff the only (closed) segments
that contain it are those with `x` as one of their endpoints. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Extreme/Variant93b7b143c0fe03757d11fa4d309c5c650e6e12408302c72ec378095ed84927f9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Extreme/Variant93b7b143c0fe03757d11fa4d309c5c650e6e12408302c72ec378095ed84927f9.lean#L230).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1534f8048721e1dfbc097d7077ee4ed9fae6301` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
