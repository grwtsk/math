## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:93138534-8db4-3506-d70a-098b4e8591a1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 606–616.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContinuousLinearMap.isStrictMap_of_finiteDimensional [T2Space F] [FiniteDimensional 𝕜 F]
    (f : E →L[𝕜] F) :
    IsStrictMap f := by
  rw [isStrictMap_iff_isQuotientMap_rangeFactorization]
  exact f.rangeRestrict.isQuotientMap_of_finiteDimensional (by simp)

/-- If `K` is a complete field and `V` is a finite-dimensional vector space over `K` (equipped with
any topology so that `V` is a topological `K`-module, meaning `[IsTopologicalAddGroup V]`
and `[ContinuousSMul K V]`), and `K` is locally compact, then `V` is locally compact.

This is not an instance because `K` cannot be inferred. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/FiniteDimension/Variant4bf7838979da6119fea747eaddaf72c3bf636f452304fabe6657f4dbf8ae49fb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/FiniteDimension/Variant4bf7838979da6119fea747eaddaf72c3bf636f452304fabe6657f4dbf8ae49fb.lean#L606).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b0a708f26fe323b4ebd668530a81a56735e0a4ab` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
