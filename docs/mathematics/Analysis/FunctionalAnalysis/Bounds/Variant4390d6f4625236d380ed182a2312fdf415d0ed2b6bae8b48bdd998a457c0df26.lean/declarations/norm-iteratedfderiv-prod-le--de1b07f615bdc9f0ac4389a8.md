## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b59f8070-5e01-0e7b-cc9b-328a3a3d9405`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 337–354.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- If the derivatives within a set of `g` at `f x` are bounded by `C`, and the `i`-th derivative
within a set of `f` at `x` is bounded by `D^i` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, then the `n`-th derivative
of `g ∘ f` is bounded by `n! * C * D^n`.
This lemma proves this estimate assuming additionally that two of the spaces live in the same
universe, to make an induction possible. Use instead `norm_iteratedFDerivWithin_comp_le` that
removes this assumption. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Bounds/Variant4390d6f4625236d380ed182a2312fdf415d0ed2b6bae8b48bdd998a457c0df26.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Bounds/Variant4390d6f4625236d380ed182a2312fdf415d0ed2b6bae8b48bdd998a457c0df26.lean#L337).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a503d47c2335fc0583a9aa26d256e96bedf21182` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
