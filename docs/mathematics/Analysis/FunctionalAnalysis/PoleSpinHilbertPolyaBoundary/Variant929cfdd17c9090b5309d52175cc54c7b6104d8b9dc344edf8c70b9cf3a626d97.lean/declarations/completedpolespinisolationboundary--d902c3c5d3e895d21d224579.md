## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:42e3bc6589ac7a2e3e0b8f647c168c34672a4dce3231342f99b1d29ec1eaf31a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 125–141.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def completedPoleSpinIsolationBoundary : PoleSpinIsolationBoundary :=
  { localSpinIsolated := true
    zeroToOneFlipAdmitted := true
    oneToZeroFlipAdmitted := true
    flipInvolutive := true
    everyPoleAccounted := true
    noUnpairedFlipResidue := true
    determinantGateReceivesSpinBoundary := true
    hilbertPolyaAuthority := false
    rhAuthority := false
    determinantGateReceivesSpinBoundary_of_closed_spin_gate := by
      intro _hIso _h01 _h10 _hInv _hEvery _hNoResidue
      rfl
    no_hilbert_polya_from_spin_boundary_alone := rfl
    no_rh_from_spin_boundary_alone := rfl }

/-- Closing the local pole-spin gate admits transfer into the determinant gate. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/PoleSpinHilbertPolyaBoundary/Variant929cfdd17c9090b5309d52175cc54c7b6104d8b9dc344edf8c70b9cf3a626d97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/PoleSpinHilbertPolyaBoundary/Variant929cfdd17c9090b5309d52175cc54c7b6104d8b9dc344edf8c70b9cf3a626d97.lean#L125).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `caf5efa0ba97efce7f045fff9fb3d39ae96fd780` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
