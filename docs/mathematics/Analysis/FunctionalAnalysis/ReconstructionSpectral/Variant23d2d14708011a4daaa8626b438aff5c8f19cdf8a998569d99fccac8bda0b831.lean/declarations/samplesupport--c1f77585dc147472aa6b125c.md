## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:aa9b43f777246b9f704504cc5a518b8a9d64cb08619d4498e9579ed9c4c6653c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 117–131.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sampleSupport
    {T : SmoothFramedSurgeryTheory}
    {p q : Nat} {M : T.Manifold}
    {embedding : T.FramedEmbedding p q M}
    {sampleSize : Nat}
    (O : PostSurgeryPointCloud T embedding sampleSize) : Set O.Ambient :=
  Set.range O.sample

end PostSurgeryPointCloud

/--
Geometric predicates supplied by the concrete smooth/metric model.  They tie
numeric scales to the actual outgoing image and surgery data.  Merely choosing
a positive real number does not produce any of these propositions.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/ReconstructionSpectral/Variant23d2d14708011a4daaa8626b438aff5c8f19cdf8a998569d99fccac8bda0b831.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/ReconstructionSpectral/Variant23d2d14708011a4daaa8626b438aff5c8f19cdf8a998569d99fccac8bda0b831.lean#L117).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `452831ef1d438d27730a63a5b96ddbe403353550` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
