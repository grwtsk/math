## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c6e6f1c-6599-0ada-3dda-c0b2d4fd6531`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 733–754.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem weighted_self_adjoint
    {vertexCount : Nat}
    (graph : FiniteGraphLaplacian vertexCount)
    (f g : Fin vertexCount → ℝ) :
    graph.innerProduct (graph.laplacian f) g =
      graph.innerProduct f (graph.laplacian g) :=
  graph.laplacian_weighted_self_adjoint f g

end FiniteGraphLaplacian

/--
A declared Laplace--Beltrami spectral model.  The Laplacian is represented by
Mathlib's `LinearPMap`, hence has an actual linear domain rather than a nominal
set attached to an everywhere-defined bounded operator.  `self_adjoint` is
Mathlib's unbounded-operator predicate and therefore entails that this domain
is dense.  A selected shifted inverse is supplied as a bounded compact
operator, with both inverse equations tying it to the unbounded Laplacian.

The function space, density, sign, boundary condition, self-adjoint
realization, and compact resolvent are all explicit inputs; topology alone
does not construct this analytic object.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/ReconstructionSpectral/Variant23d2d14708011a4daaa8626b438aff5c8f19cdf8a998569d99fccac8bda0b831.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/ReconstructionSpectral/Variant23d2d14708011a4daaa8626b438aff5c8f19cdf8a998569d99fccac8bda0b831.lean#L733).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `452831ef1d438d27730a63a5b96ddbe403353550` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
