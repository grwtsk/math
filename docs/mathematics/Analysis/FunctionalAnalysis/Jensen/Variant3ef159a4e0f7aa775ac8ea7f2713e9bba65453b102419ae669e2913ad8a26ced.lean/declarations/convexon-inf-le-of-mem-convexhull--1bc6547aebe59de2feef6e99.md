## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:95d6c631-360d-d865-bfff-15a35a7192da`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 263–269.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ConvexOn.inf_le_of_mem_convexHull {t : Finset E} (hf : ConcaveOn 𝕜 s f) (hts : ↑t ⊆ s)
    (hx : x ∈ convexHull 𝕜 (t : Set E)) :
    t.inf' (coe_nonempty.1 <| convexHull_nonempty_iff.1 ⟨x, hx⟩) f ≤ f x :=
  hf.dual.le_sup_of_mem_convexHull hts hx

/-- If a function `f` is convex on `s`, then the value it takes at some center of mass of points of
`s` is less than the value it takes on one of those points. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Jensen/Variant3ef159a4e0f7aa775ac8ea7f2713e9bba65453b102419ae669e2913ad8a26ced.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Jensen/Variant3ef159a4e0f7aa775ac8ea7f2713e9bba65453b102419ae669e2913ad8a26ced.lean#L263).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `89480b11ec63bfe142d814198b0cf685f44b4daa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
