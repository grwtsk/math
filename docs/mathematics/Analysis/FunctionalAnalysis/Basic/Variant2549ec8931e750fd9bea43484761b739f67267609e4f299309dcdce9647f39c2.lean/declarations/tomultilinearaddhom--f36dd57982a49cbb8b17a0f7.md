## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6ec02a33ac4ed1b03636273e16bbf676492666cd2d181c6a75d8e80f95ac12f3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 248–256.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toMultilinearAddHom : M [⋀^ι]→L[R] N →+ ContinuousMultilinearMap R (fun _ : ι => M) N :=
  ⟨⟨fun f => f.1, rfl⟩, fun _ _ => rfl⟩

end ContinuousAdd

/-- If `f` is a continuous alternating map, then `f.toContinuousLinearMap m i` is the continuous
linear map obtained by fixing all coordinates but `i` equal to those of `m`, and varying the
`i`-th coordinate. -/
@[simps! apply]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variant2549ec8931e750fd9bea43484761b739f67267609e4f299309dcdce9647f39c2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variant2549ec8931e750fd9bea43484761b739f67267609e4f299309dcdce9647f39c2.lean#L248).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `507a5c1ebcb4220f2b4ee0721a4b55d6db3dcd0e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
