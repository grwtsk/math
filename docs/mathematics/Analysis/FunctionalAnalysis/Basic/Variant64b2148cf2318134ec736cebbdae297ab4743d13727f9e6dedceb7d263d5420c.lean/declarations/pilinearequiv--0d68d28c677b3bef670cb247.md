## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:714fc4513e0384d3e13e6828dcdc4856554b4ccceb7c2e2d73edd9482bb6a706`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 585–603.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def piLinearEquiv {ι' : Type*} {M' : ι' → Type*} [∀ i, AddCommMonoid (M' i)]
    [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (M' i)] [∀ i, ContinuousAdd (M' i)] [∀ i, Module R' (M' i)]
    [∀ i, Module A (M' i)] [∀ i, SMulCommClass A R' (M' i)] [∀ i, ContinuousConstSMul R' (M' i)] :
    (∀ i, ContinuousMultilinearMap A M₁ (M' i)) ≃ₗ[R'] ContinuousMultilinearMap A M₁ (∀ i, M' i) :=
  { piEquiv with
    map_add' := fun _ _ => rfl
    map_smul' := fun _ _ => rfl }

end Module

section CommAlgebra

variable (R ι) (A : Type*) [Fintype ι] [CommSemiring R] [CommSemiring A] [Algebra R A]
  [TopologicalSpace A] [ContinuousMul A]

/-- The continuous multilinear map on `A^ι`, where `A` is a normed commutative algebra
over `𝕜`, associating to `m` the product of all the `m i`.

See also `ContinuousMultilinearMap.mkPiAlgebraFin`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variant64b2148cf2318134ec736cebbdae297ab4743d13727f9e6dedceb7d263d5420c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variant64b2148cf2318134ec736cebbdae297ab4743d13727f9e6dedceb7d263d5420c.lean#L585).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e7976713db7572543ced2bc2edd97a5aa36369a0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
