## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1a83006d-55a9-497b-242c-895607c8fa7e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 310–320.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem convex_hyperplane {f : E → β} (h : IsLinearMap 𝕜 f) (r : β) : Convex 𝕜 { w | f w = r } := by
  simp_rw [le_antisymm_iff]
  exact (convex_halfspace_le h r).inter (convex_halfspace_ge h r)
#align convex_hyperplane convex_hyperplane

end OrderedAddCommMonoid

section OrderedCancelAddCommMonoid

variable [OrderedCancelAddCommMonoid β] [Module 𝕜 β] [OrderedSMul 𝕜 β]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variantd2d3b1b41e3680a01bc658f52509adea6be11bb5a2feff1ee7b1f819add9fbc2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variantd2d3b1b41e3680a01bc658f52509adea6be11bb5a2feff1ee7b1f819add9fbc2.lean#L310).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ba916e3cff660920e51dd42b1afacb020d30e246` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
