## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:27a00b7a-d253-d2a8-9afa-e8645a36e4cc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 467–479.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem coe_restrictScalars (f : ContinuousMultilinearMap A M₁ M₂) : ⇑(f.restrictScalars R) = f :=
  rfl

end RestrictScalar

end Semiring

section Ring

variable [Ring R] [∀ i, AddCommGroup (M₁ i)] [AddCommGroup M₂] [∀ i, Module R (M₁ i)] [Module R M₂]
  [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (M₁ i)] [TopologicalSpace M₂] (f f' : ContinuousMultilinearMap R M₁ M₂)

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variant1b1540c44311f56881491785d86e53376b99fe5e0f2eb324b2960f367c2dad63.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variant1b1540c44311f56881491785d86e53376b99fe5e0f2eb324b2960f367c2dad63.lean#L467).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `10b8e250243af37700723dcdfb6076d94f0965b0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
