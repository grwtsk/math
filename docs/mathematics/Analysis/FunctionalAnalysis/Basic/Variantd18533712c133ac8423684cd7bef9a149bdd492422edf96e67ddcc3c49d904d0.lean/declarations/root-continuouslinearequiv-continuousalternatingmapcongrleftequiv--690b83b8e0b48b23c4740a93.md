## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:b72553aa7c4ad74c151bf69afb537aae15a1fafa8b2b854fbf8f47be5334de82`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 343–352.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def _root_.ContinuousLinearEquiv.continuousAlternatingMapCongrLeftEquiv (e : M ≃L[R] M') :
    M [⋀^ι]→L[R] N ≃ M' [⋀^ι]→L[R] N where
  toFun f := f.compContinuousLinearMap ↑e.symm
  invFun f := f.compContinuousLinearMap ↑e
  left_inv f := by ext; simp [Function.comp_def]
  right_inv f := by ext; simp [Function.comp_def]

defines an equivalence between continuous alternating maps. -/

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variantd18533712c133ac8423684cd7bef9a149bdd492422edf96e67ddcc3c49d904d0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variantd18533712c133ac8423684cd7bef9a149bdd492422edf96e67ddcc3c49d904d0.lean#L343).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8b349492ea9a25945a3523d063a266dc2e9b0627` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
