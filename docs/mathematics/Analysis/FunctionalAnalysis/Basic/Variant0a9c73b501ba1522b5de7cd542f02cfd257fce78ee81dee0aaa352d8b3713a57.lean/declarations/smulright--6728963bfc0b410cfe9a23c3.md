## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:07cd8146456d038929083545dfd1e7606b6c387f6a86f372b49a3134085efbda`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 607–620.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def smulRight : M [⋀^ι]→L[R] N :=
  { f.toAlternatingMap.smulRight z with toContinuousMultilinearMap := f.1.smulRight z }

end SMulRight

section Semiring

variable {R M M' N N' ι : Type*} [CommSemiring R] [AddCommMonoid M] [Module R M]
  [TopologicalSpace M] [AddCommMonoid M'] [Module R M'] [TopologicalSpace M'] [AddCommMonoid N]
  [Module R N] [TopologicalSpace N] [ContinuousAdd N] [ContinuousConstSMul R N] [AddCommMonoid N']
  [Module R N'] [TopologicalSpace N'] [ContinuousAdd N'] [ContinuousConstSMul R N']

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variant0a9c73b501ba1522b5de7cd542f02cfd257fce78ee81dee0aaa352d8b3713a57.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variant0a9c73b501ba1522b5de7cd542f02cfd257fce78ee81dee0aaa352d8b3713a57.lean#L607).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6059bd0ee17451999109f265eef7964b8b21631b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
