## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1ad7df49b656f160ec42e11ff5d6a95bf34d16be8aebf4c88803b2ccb1dbac14`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 581–599.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def piLinearEquiv {ι' : Type*} {M' : ι' → Type*} [∀ i, AddCommMonoid (M' i)]
    [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (M' i)] [∀ i, ContinuousAdd (M' i)] [∀ i, Module R (M' i)]
    [∀ i, Module A (M' i)] [∀ i, SMulCommClass A R (M' i)] [∀ i, ContinuousConstSMul R (M' i)] :
    (∀ i, M [⋀^ι]→L[A] M' i) ≃ₗ[R] M [⋀^ι]→L[A] ∀ i, M' i :=
  { piEquiv with
    map_add' := fun _ _ => rfl
    map_smul' := fun _ _ => rfl }

end Module

continuous alternating map sending `m` to `f m • z`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variant00e64a1402a53f4cdc2e55c9f8e194b280007288d5c2550fb04a76fb2d4a67c5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Basic/Variant00e64a1402a53f4cdc2e55c9f8e194b280007288d5c2550fb04a76fb2d4a67c5.lean#L581).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `be2f6b9c756e13fdc6972589ab4780c3ce4426b3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
