## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:96906235-70ce-242b-7b10-3c3d64ef06df`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 204–220.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_prime_lt_and_le_two_mul_eventually (n : ℕ) (n_large : 512 ≤ n) :
    ∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ n < p ∧ p ≤ 2 * n := by
  have no_prime : 4 ^ n < n * n.centralBinom :=
    Nat.four_pow_lt_mul_centralBinom n (le_trans (by norm_num1) n_large)
  -- Assume there is no prime in the range.
  contrapose! no_prime
  -- Then we have the above sub-exponential bound on the size of this central binomial coefficient.
  -- We now couple this bound with an exponential lower bound on the central binomial coefficient,
  -- yielding an inequality which we have seen is false for large enough n.
  have : n.centralBinom ≤ (2 * n) ^ sqrt (2 * n) * 4 ^ (2 * n / 3) :=
    centralBinom_le_of_no_bertrand_prime n (lt_of_lt_of_le (by norm_num1) n_large) no_prime

/-- Proves that Bertrand's postulate holds over all positive naturals less than n by identifying a
descending list of primes, each no more than twice the next, such that the list contains a witness
for each number ≤ n.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Bertrand/Variantb8482d2eeafa9d4ac7a21ed56b8c3aafdc59bafadc42fefb9c51a537a6d6e46a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Bertrand/Variantb8482d2eeafa9d4ac7a21ed56b8c3aafdc59bafadc42fefb9c51a537a6d6e46a.lean#L204).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a6443353b90c3a5fd596efbdeb81f8d7b49ae73` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
