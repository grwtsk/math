## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b752b52c-071a-6800-5d23-ef14d89a3571`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 230–252.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_prime_lt_and_le_two_mul (n : ℕ) (hn0 : n ≠ 0) :
    ∃ p, Nat.Prime p ∧ n < p ∧ p ≤ 2 * n := by
  -- Split into cases whether `n` is large or small
  rcases lt_or_ge 511 n with h | h
  -- If `n` is large, apply the lemma derived from the inequalities on the central binomial
  -- coefficient.
  · exact exists_prime_lt_and_le_two_mul_eventually n h
  replace h : n < 521 := h.trans_lt (by norm_num1)
  revert h
  -- For small `n`, supply a list of primes to cover the initial cases.

    for i in [317, 163, 83, 43, 23, 13, 7, 5, 3, 2] do
      let i : Term := quote i
      evalTactic <| ←
        `(tactic| refine exists_prime_lt_and_le_two_mul_succ $i (by norm_num1) (by norm_num1) ?_)

alias bertrand := Nat.exists_prime_lt_and_le_two_mul

end Nat

end Nat
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Bertrand/Variantb8482d2eeafa9d4ac7a21ed56b8c3aafdc59bafadc42fefb9c51a537a6d6e46a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Bertrand/Variantb8482d2eeafa9d4ac7a21ed56b8c3aafdc59bafadc42fefb9c51a537a6d6e46a.lean#L230).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5a6443353b90c3a5fd596efbdeb81f8d7b49ae73` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
