## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:31fa3d21ea133aaf7d7d44a8209a899391cb9d83e43ba25e4eecc1a6d04ac390`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 158–170.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance continuousLinearMap.isLinear [∀ x, ContinuousAdd (E₂ x)] [∀ x, ContinuousSMul 𝕜₂ (E₂ x)] :
    (Pretrivialization.continuousLinearMap σ e₁ e₂).IsLinear 𝕜₂ where
  linear x _ :=
    { map_add := fun L L' =>
        show (e₂.continuousLinearMapAt 𝕜₂ x).comp ((L + L').comp (e₁.symmL 𝕜₁ x)) = _ by
          simp_rw [add_comp, comp_add]
          rfl
      map_smul := fun c L =>
        show (e₂.continuousLinearMapAt 𝕜₂ x).comp ((c • L).comp (e₁.symmL 𝕜₁ x)) = _ by
          simp_rw [smul_comp, comp_smulₛₗ, RingHom.id_apply]
          rfl }
#align pretrivialization.continuous_linear_map.is_linear Pretrivialization.continuousLinearMap.isLinear

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Hom/Variantd7aa85b1e4074980c5f5c7c027100ca05803cb6f6865968fc761cf644ec503fc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Hom/Variantd7aa85b1e4074980c5f5c7c027100ca05803cb6f6865968fc761cf644ec503fc.lean#L158).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3fc10f547d6e4af0e18eb15af84848eb6d1c92b7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
