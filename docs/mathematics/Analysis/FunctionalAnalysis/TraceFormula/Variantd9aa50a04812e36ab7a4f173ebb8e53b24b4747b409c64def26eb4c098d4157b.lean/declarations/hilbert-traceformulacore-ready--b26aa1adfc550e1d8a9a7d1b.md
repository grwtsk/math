## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d72ff9b4125e066f1ec0894a3a827f51fa4508a2a7d4db4f273540b7b97e8e69`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 131–148.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def Hilbert.TraceFormulaCore.ready
    (C : Hilbert.TraceFormulaCore.{u, v}) : Prop :=
  C.traceSide.ready ∧
    C.spectralSide.ready ∧
      C.geometricSide.ready ∧
        C.selfAdjoint?.isSome = true ∧
          C.traceClass?.isSome = true ∧
            C.spectralMeasure?.isSome = true ∧
              C.spectralTheorem?.isSome = true

/--
Theorem readiness for the Hilbert-level core.

Stronger than ordinary readiness: it additionally requires the
normalization-compatibility and side-compatibility obligations to hold.  Even
theorem readiness does not assert a trace formula; it asserts that the
declared analytic obligations for this operator package are discharged.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/TraceFormula/Variantd9aa50a04812e36ab7a4f173ebb8e53b24b4747b409c64def26eb4c098d4157b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/TraceFormula/Variantd9aa50a04812e36ab7a4f173ebb8e53b24b4747b409c64def26eb4c098d4157b.lean#L131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `025daddd628d8eec13a0ca5a33aba2752142a220` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
