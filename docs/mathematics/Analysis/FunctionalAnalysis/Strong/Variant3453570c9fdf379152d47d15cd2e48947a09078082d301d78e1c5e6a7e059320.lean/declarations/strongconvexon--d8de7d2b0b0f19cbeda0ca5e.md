## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:718d51f518ccda0ff88eb5143391ef37570a284555ce086753fc2964e438f549`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 116–122.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def StrongConvexOn (s : Set E) (m : ℝ) : (E → ℝ) → Prop :=
  UniformConvexOn s fun r ↦ m / (2 : ℝ) * r ^ 2

/-- A function `f` from a real normed space is `m`-strongly concave if is strongly concave with
modulus `φ(r) = m / 2 * r ^ 2`.

In an inner product space, this is equivalent to `x ↦ f x + m / 2 * ‖x‖ ^ 2` being concave. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Strong/Variant3453570c9fdf379152d47d15cd2e48947a09078082d301d78e1c5e6a7e059320.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Strong/Variant3453570c9fdf379152d47d15cd2e48947a09078082d301d78e1c5e6a7e059320.lean#L116).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0c23360f9dc5e96d4bb15c7c0107cc4403253384` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
