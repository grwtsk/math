## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c7027292-8062-ee8c-6939-bb43c3ed03a6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 313–319.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ContinuousLinearMap.reApplyInnerSelf_smul (T : E →L[𝕜] E) (x : E) {c : 𝕜} :
    T.reApplyInnerSelf (c • x) = ‖c‖ ^ 2 * T.reApplyInnerSelf x := by
  simp only [ContinuousLinearMap.map_smul, ContinuousLinearMap.reApplyInnerSelf_apply,
    inner_smul_left, inner_smul_right, ← mul_assoc, mul_conj, ← ofReal_pow, ← smul_re,
    Algebra.smul_def (‖c‖ ^ 2) ⟪T x, x⟫, algebraMap_eq_ofReal]

end ReApplyInnerSelf_Seminormed
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/LinearMap/Variante75f385cd4535180b9d2e88cf89d5a1f6f6143502699ddecd3984cd075fcb648.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/LinearMap/Variante75f385cd4535180b9d2e88cf89d5a1f6f6143502699ddecd3984cd075fcb648.lean#L313).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9455aca504e27ca966170128be77a5c661e2298a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
