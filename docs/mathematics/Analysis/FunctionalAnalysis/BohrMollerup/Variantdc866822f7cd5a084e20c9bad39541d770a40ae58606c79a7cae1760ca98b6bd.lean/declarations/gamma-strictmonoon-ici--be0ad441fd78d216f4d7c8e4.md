## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:75fff01c-eafc-b1b9-adf4-7ad95cdc83d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 434–456.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

## The Gamma doubling formula

As a fun application of the Bohr-Mollerup theorem, we prove the Gamma-function doubling formula
(for positive real `s`). The idea is that `2 ^ s * Gamma (s / 2) * Gamma (s / 2 + 1 / 2)` is
log-convex and satisfies the Gamma functional equation, so it must actually be a constant
multiple of `Gamma`, and we can compute the constant by specialising at `s = 1`. -/


/-- Auxiliary definition for the doubling formula (we'll show this is equal to `Gamma s`) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/BohrMollerup/Variantdc866822f7cd5a084e20c9bad39541d770a40ae58606c79a7cae1760ca98b6bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
