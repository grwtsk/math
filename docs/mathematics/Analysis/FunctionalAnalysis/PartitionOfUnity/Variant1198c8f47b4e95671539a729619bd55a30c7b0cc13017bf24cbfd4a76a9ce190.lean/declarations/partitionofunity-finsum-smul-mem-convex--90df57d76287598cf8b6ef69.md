## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:318fc318-1eee-f1a3-f4a6-e39155f97160`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 46–59.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

variable [NormalSpace X] [ParacompactSpace X] [TopologicalSpace E] [ContinuousAdd E]
  [ContinuousSMul ℝ E] {t : X → Set E}

/-- Let `X` be a normal paracompact topological space (e.g., any extended metric space). Let `E` be
a topological real vector space. Let `t : X → Set E` be a family of convex sets. Suppose that for
each point `x : X`, there exists a neighborhood `U ∈ 𝓝 X` and a function `g : X → E` that is
continuous on `U` and sends each `y ∈ U` to a point of `t y`. Then there exists a continuous map
`g : C(X, E)` such that `g x ∈ t x` for all `x`. See also
`exists_continuous_forall_mem_convex_of_local_const`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/PartitionOfUnity/Variant1198c8f47b4e95671539a729619bd55a30c7b0cc13017bf24cbfd4a76a9ce190.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/PartitionOfUnity/Variant1198c8f47b4e95671539a729619bd55a30c7b0cc13017bf24cbfd4a76a9ce190.lean#L46).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `10f2592a49b27d733c82db2de566bfd823920f2b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
