## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:436c98bf12df4778bae1774873dbcfa7fd6c271a528533b24aa9a656a48f0786`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 169–176.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def evaluateTerm (table : FiniteTable) (assignment : List ℕ) : Term → Option ℕ
  | .variable index => assignment[index]?
  | .nullary constructor => tableOutput table constructor []
  | .unary constructor argument => do
    let input ← evaluateTerm table assignment argument
    tableOutput table constructor [input]

/-- A proposed catalog edge together with the derivation required to justify its endpoints. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Congruence/Variantd6253ce0a8d79fef03a7f8259e8ed23bf4ff105a2b3fab930f1ebe420ab99ca4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Congruence/Variantd6253ce0a8d79fef03a7f8259e8ed23bf4ff105a2b3fab930f1ebe420ab99ca4.lean#L169).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1d9264e160c546c9d8dc700caed09f5ae392941b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
