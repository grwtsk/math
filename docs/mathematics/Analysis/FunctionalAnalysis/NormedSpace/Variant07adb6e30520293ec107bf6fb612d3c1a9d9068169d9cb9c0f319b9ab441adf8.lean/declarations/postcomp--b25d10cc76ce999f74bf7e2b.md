## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:82007b485ed7c877e4916239b2f33693347dde963dba4cfc1f2e30cb524dd1fd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 68–80.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def postcomp [RingHomIsometric σ₁₂] [RingHomIsometric σ₁₃] (a : F →ₛₗᵢ[σ₂₃] G) :
    (E →SL[σ₁₂] F) →ₛₗᵢ[σ₂₃] (E →SL[σ₁₃] G) where
  toFun f := a.toContinuousLinearMap.comp f
  map_add' f g := by simp
  map_smul' c f := by simp
  norm_map' f := by simp [a.norm_toContinuousLinearMap_comp]

end LinearIsometry

namespace LinearIsometryEquiv
variable [NontrivialTopology E] {σ₁₂ : 𝕜 →+* 𝕜₂} {σ₂₁ : 𝕜₂ →+* 𝕜}
  [RingHomInvPair σ₁₂ σ₂₁] [RingHomInvPair σ₂₁ σ₁₂] [RingHomIsometric σ₁₂]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/NormedSpace/Variant07adb6e30520293ec107bf6fb612d3c1a9d9068169d9cb9c0f319b9ab441adf8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/NormedSpace/Variant07adb6e30520293ec107bf6fb612d3c1a9d9068169d9cb9c0f319b9ab441adf8.lean#L68).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `734164008bf7764323566e441eaca2547605822e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
