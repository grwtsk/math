## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1f8f80b4707fa2f2f4821d6592eb59311d5ef4711f7253dc3138bff1958035de`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 147–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure PreInnerProductSpace.Core (𝕜 : Type*) (F : Type*) [RCLike 𝕜] [AddCommGroup F]
    [Module 𝕜 F] extends Inner 𝕜 F where
  /-- The inner product is *Hermitian*, taking the `conj` swaps the arguments. -/
  conj_inner_symm x y : conj (inner y x) = inner x y
  /-- The inner product is positive (semi)definite. -/
  re_inner_nonneg x : 0 ≤ re (inner x x)
  /-- The inner product is additive in the first coordinate. -/
  add_left x y z : inner (x + y) z = inner x z + inner y z
  /-- The inner product is conjugate linear in the first coordinate. -/
  smul_left x y r : inner (r • x) y = conj r * inner x y

attribute [class] PreInnerProductSpace.Core

/-- A structure requiring that a scalar product is positive definite. Some theorems that
require these assumptions are put under section `InnerProductSpace.Core`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Defs/Variant417450ff468b4795ce5cfeb51715dc9a1dc026926e483ff6ec76cf04ae528404.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Defs/Variant417450ff468b4795ce5cfeb51715dc9a1dc026926e483ff6ec76cf04ae528404.lean#L147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7fd4ed84fb15b74a247f0db5aca286b9750e590d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
