## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f7a45a2345210f7d987a8a7820783dec8d460044977759130d513146bf62b463`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 82–108.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class Inner (𝕜 E : Type*) where
  /-- The inner product function. -/
  inner (𝕜) : E → E → 𝕜

export Inner (inner)

/-- The inner product with values in `𝕜`. -/
scoped[InnerProductSpace] notation:max "⟪" x ", " y "⟫_" 𝕜:max => inner 𝕜 x y

section Notations

/-- The inner product with values in `ℝ`. -/
scoped[RealInnerProductSpace] notation "⟪" x ", " y "⟫" => inner ℝ x y

/-- The inner product with values in `ℂ`. -/
scoped[ComplexInnerProductSpace] notation "⟪" x ", " y "⟫" => inner ℂ x y

end Notations

/-- A (pre) inner product space is a vector space with an additional operation called inner product.
The (semi)norm could be derived from the inner product, instead we require the existence of a
seminorm and the fact that `‖x‖^2 = re ⟪x, x⟫` to be able to put instances on `𝕂` or product spaces.

Note that `NormedSpace` does not assume that `‖x‖=0` implies `x=0` (it is rather a seminorm).

To construct a seminorm from an inner product, see `PreInnerProductSpace.ofCore`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Defs/Variant7416141a097dc2d686a81319d9ec71e33f75d1e4ff3a8076bd21b1ced235bf48.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Defs/Variant7416141a097dc2d686a81319d9ec71e33f75d1e4ff3a8076bd21b1ced235bf48.lean#L82).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e52275982c4e008c8b44ea460ffe569b865e9705` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
