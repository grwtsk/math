## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:eecf839e399f0f102eebd2d0439a54d0690027cbe55966886b14fa74e5a7ce42`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–130.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class InnerProductSpace (𝕜 : Type*) (E : Type*) [RCLike 𝕜] [SeminormedAddCommGroup E] extends
  NormedSpace 𝕜 E, Inner 𝕜 E where
  /-- The inner product induces the norm. -/
  norm_sq_eq_re_inner : ∀ x : E, ‖x‖ ^ 2 = re (inner x x)
  /-- The inner product is *hermitian*, taking the `conj` swaps the arguments. -/
  conj_inner_symm : ∀ x y, conj (inner y x) = inner x y
  /-- The inner product is additive in the first coordinate. -/
  add_left : ∀ x y z, inner (x + y) z = inner x z + inner y z
  /-- The inner product is conjugate linear in the first coordinate. -/
  smul_left : ∀ x y r, inner (r • x) y = conj r * inner x y

### Constructing a normed space structure from an inner product

In the definition of an inner product space, we require the existence of a norm, which is equal
(but maybe not defeq) to the square root of the scalar product. This makes it possible to put
an inner product space structure on spaces with a preexisting norm (for instance `ℝ`), with good
properties. However, sometimes, one would like to define the norm starting only from a well-behaved
scalar product. This is what we implement in this paragraph, starting from a structure
`InnerProductSpace.Core` stating that we have a nice scalar product.

Our goal here is not to develop a whole theory with all the supporting API, as this will be done
below for `InnerProductSpace`. Instead, we implement the bare minimum to go as directly as
possible to the construction of the norm and the proof of the triangular inequality.

Warning: Do not use this `Core` structure if the space you are interested in already has a norm
instance defined on it, otherwise this will create a second non-defeq norm instance!

/-- A structure requiring that a scalar product is positive semidefinite and symmetric. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Defs/Variantdc2bae96e3bd46a9a8767ec0273c0bbef258555dbad3bf700db75a0fc6da7272.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Defs/Variantdc2bae96e3bd46a9a8767ec0273c0bbef258555dbad3bf700db75a0fc6da7272.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5b53a66066a81ec017b5e50074c6e7d68d44b972` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
