## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:136977fb-6d60-fed7-2583-351e546eca5b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1084–1091.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem LinearIsometry.adjoint_comp_self' {E E' : Type*}
    [NormedAddCommGroup E] [InnerProductSpace 𝕜 E] [FiniteDimensional 𝕜 E]
    [NormedAddCommGroup E'] [InnerProductSpace 𝕜 E'] [FiniteDimensional 𝕜 E'] (f : E →ₗᵢ[𝕜] E') :
    f.adjoint ∘ₗ f.toLinearMap = LinearMap.id := by
  have := FiniteDimensional.complete 𝕜 E
  have := FiniteDimensional.complete 𝕜 E'
  ext x
  exact congr($(f.adjoint_comp_self) x)
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Adjoint/Variant48328a127136f3370b974169236338dd8572ec6b444630969b41ccbb7b0f3276.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Adjoint/Variant48328a127136f3370b974169236338dd8572ec6b444630969b41ccbb7b0f3276.lean#L1084).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `96c62ef8510b228769fe6fd9a1e8d0d59cfd0b70` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
