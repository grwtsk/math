## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:28a30e09-b012-d129-86ff-6dd06fccf606`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 410–423.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_segment_iff_sameRay : x ∈ [y -[𝕜] z] ↔ SameRay 𝕜 (x - y) (z - x) := by
  refine' ⟨sameRay_of_mem_segment, fun h => _⟩

  rw [add_comm, sub_add_sub_cancel] at hxy hzx
  rw [← mem_segment_translate _ (-x), neg_add_self]
  refine' ⟨b, a, hb, ha, add_comm a b ▸ hab, _⟩
  rw [← sub_eq_neg_add, ← neg_sub, hxy, ← sub_eq_neg_add, hzx, smul_neg, smul_comm, neg_add_self]

open AffineMap

/-- If `z = lineMap x y c` is a point on the line passing through `x` and `y`, then the open
segment `openSegment 𝕜 x y` is included in the union of the open segments `openSegment 𝕜 x z`,
`openSegment 𝕜 z y`, and the point `z`. Informally, `(x, y) ⊆ {z} ∪ (x, z) ∪ (z, y)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Segment/Variant5f24bd3bddc6c3d2a734a9172236be9a5c22f50fba18b3cec002a1ea2187c8ec.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Segment/Variant5f24bd3bddc6c3d2a734a9172236be9a5c22f50fba18b3cec002a1ea2187c8ec.lean#L410).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `523919ae0d967c84b944a1b53bed08e1bf59e24d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
