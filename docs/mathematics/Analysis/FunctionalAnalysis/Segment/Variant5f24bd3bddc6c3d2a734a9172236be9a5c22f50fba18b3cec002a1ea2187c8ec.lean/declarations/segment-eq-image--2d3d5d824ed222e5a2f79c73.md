## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:85d7ccca-c866-5ecd-6a3d-e3a1b2fe8df1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 70–75.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem segment_eq_image₂ (x y : E) :
    [x -[𝕜] y] =
      (fun p : 𝕜 × 𝕜 => p.1 • x + p.2 • y) '' { p | 0 ≤ p.1 ∧ 0 ≤ p.2 ∧ p.1 + p.2 = 1 } :=
  by simp only [segment, image, Prod.exists, mem_setOf_eq, exists_prop, and_assoc]
#align segment_eq_image₂ segment_eq_image₂

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Segment/Variant5f24bd3bddc6c3d2a734a9172236be9a5c22f50fba18b3cec002a1ea2187c8ec.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Segment/Variant5f24bd3bddc6c3d2a734a9172236be9a5c22f50fba18b3cec002a1ea2187c8ec.lean#L70).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `523919ae0d967c84b944a1b53bed08e1bf59e24d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
