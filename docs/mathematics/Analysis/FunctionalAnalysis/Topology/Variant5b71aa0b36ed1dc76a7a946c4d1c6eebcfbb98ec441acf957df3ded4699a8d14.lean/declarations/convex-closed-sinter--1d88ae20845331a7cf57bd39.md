## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6f58ad03-f108-3800-2900-824a526affcd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 294–301.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem convex_closed_sInter {S : Set (Set E)} (h : ∀ s ∈ S, Convex 𝕜 s ∧ IsClosed s) :
    Convex 𝕜 (⋂₀ S) ∧ IsClosed (⋂₀ S) :=
  ⟨fun _ hx => starConvex_sInter fun _ hs => (h _ hs).1 <| hx _ hs,
    isClosed_sInter fun _ hs => (h _ hs).2⟩

variable (𝕜) in
/-- The convex closed hull of a set `s` is the minimal convex closed set that includes `s`. -/
@[simps! isClosed]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Topology/Variant5b71aa0b36ed1dc76a7a946c4d1c6eebcfbb98ec441acf957df3ded4699a8d14.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/Topology/Variant5b71aa0b36ed1dc76a7a946c4d1c6eebcfbb98ec441acf957df3ded4699a8d14.lean#L294).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `51283a0c387734d1c7798d121795287ba19867c4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
