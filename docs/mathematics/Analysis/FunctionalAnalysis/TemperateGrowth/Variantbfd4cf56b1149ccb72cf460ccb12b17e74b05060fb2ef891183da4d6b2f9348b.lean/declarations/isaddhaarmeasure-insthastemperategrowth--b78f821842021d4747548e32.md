## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:ae1569fae3ddc1bbe77b475ef5e42475c602c02d1a10d07d76c1c500a7c9ceb6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 499–506.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance IsAddHaarMeasure.instHasTemperateGrowth {μ : Measure E}
    [h : μ.IsAddHaarMeasure] : μ.HasTemperateGrowth :=
  ⟨⟨finrank ℝ E + 1, by apply integrable_one_add_norm; norm_num⟩⟩

/-- Pointwise inequality to control `x ^ k * f` in terms of `1 / (1 + x) ^ l` if one controls both
`f` (with a bound `C₁`) and `x ^ (k + l) * f` (with a bound `C₂`). This will be used to check
integrability of `x ^ k * f x` when `f` is a Schwartz function, and to control explicitly its
integral in terms of suitable seminorms of `f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/TemperateGrowth/Variantbfd4cf56b1149ccb72cf460ccb12b17e74b05060fb2ef891183da4d6b2f9348b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/FunctionalAnalysis/TemperateGrowth/Variantbfd4cf56b1149ccb72cf460ccb12b17e74b05060fb2ef891183da4d6b2f9348b.lean#L499).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `97ec26c2b3c796caa8e997a28d64d404f28af170` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
