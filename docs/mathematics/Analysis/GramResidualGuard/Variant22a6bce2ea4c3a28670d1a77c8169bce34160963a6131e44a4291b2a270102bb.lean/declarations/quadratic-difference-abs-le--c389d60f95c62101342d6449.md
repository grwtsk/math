## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b55035cd-ee0b-a1a9-c753-53031889bdb8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 26–38.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

private theorem quadratic_difference_abs_le (H P : E →L[𝕜] E) (u : E) :
    |H.reApplyInnerSelf u-P.reApplyInnerSelf u| ≤ ‖H-P‖*‖u‖^2 := by
  have he : H.reApplyInnerSelf u-P.reApplyInnerSelf u =
      re (inner 𝕜 ((H-P) u) u) := by
    simp [ContinuousLinearMap.reApplyInnerSelf,inner_sub_left]
  rw [he]

    |re (inner 𝕜 ((H-P) u) u)| ≤ ‖inner 𝕜 ((H-P) u) u‖ := abs_re_le_norm _
    _ ≤ ‖(H-P) u‖*‖u‖ := norm_inner_le_norm _ _
    _ ≤ (‖H-P‖*‖u‖)*‖u‖ := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right ((H-P).le_opNorm u) (norm_nonneg _)
    _ = _ := by ring

/-- A positive approximant supplies only a norm-scaled lower bound on the unchanged operator. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/GramResidualGuard/Variant22a6bce2ea4c3a28670d1a77c8169bce34160963a6131e44a4291b2a270102bb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/GramResidualGuard/Variant22a6bce2ea4c3a28670d1a77c8169bce34160963a6131e44a4291b2a270102bb.lean#L26).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4257c3d93fdf299684c662993bc4df12b8d7fd9a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
