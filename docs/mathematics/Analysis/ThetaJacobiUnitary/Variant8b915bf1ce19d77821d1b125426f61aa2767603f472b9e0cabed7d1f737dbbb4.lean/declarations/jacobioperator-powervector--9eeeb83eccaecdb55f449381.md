## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7a5e294a-6ee3-2549-6a97-2b3a6ffc1000`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 275–286.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem jacobiOperator_powerVector {t : ℝ} (ht : 0 ≤ t) (n : ℕ) :
    jacobiOperator t ht (jacobiPowerDomainVector t ht n) = jacobiPowerVector t ht (n + 1) := by
  apply (pointedUnitary t ht).injective
  rw [pointedUnitary_jacobiOperator]
  have hd : domainUnitary t ht (jacobiPowerDomainVector t ht n) =
      polynomialDomainVector t ht (X ^ n) := by
    apply Subtype.ext
    exact (pointedUnitary t ht).apply_symm_apply _
  rw [hd, coordinateMultiplication_powerVector n ht]
  exact ((pointedUnitary t ht).apply_symm_apply _).symm

/-- Raw theta moments belong to the literal original pointed vector √m₀ e₀. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/ThetaJacobiUnitary/Variant8b915bf1ce19d77821d1b125426f61aa2767603f472b9e0cabed7d1f737dbbb4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/ThetaJacobiUnitary/Variant8b915bf1ce19d77821d1b125426f61aa2767603f472b9e0cabed7d1f737dbbb4.lean#L275).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0c51c4e8da48186d3a1390eae01b010fe48b06fd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
