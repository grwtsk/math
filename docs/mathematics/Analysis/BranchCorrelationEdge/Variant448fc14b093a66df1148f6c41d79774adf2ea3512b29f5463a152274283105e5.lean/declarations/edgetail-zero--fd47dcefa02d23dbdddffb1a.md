## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8fcb5761-f122-410e-fe29-d572b5b84bdc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 169–176.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem edgeTail_zero {A : ℝ} (hA : 0 < A) :
    edgeTail A 0 = 6144 / (5 * A ^ 9 * sourceNormalization A) := by
  unfold edgeTail
  norm_num [Fin.sum_univ_succ, Fin.succ, edgeCoefficient, overlapWeight]
  field_simp [hA.ne']
  ring

/-- At a fixed source scale the entire tail is continuous, including zero edge distance. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/BranchCorrelationEdge/Variant448fc14b093a66df1148f6c41d79774adf2ea3512b29f5463a152274283105e5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/BranchCorrelationEdge/Variant448fc14b093a66df1148f6c41d79774adf2ea3512b29f5463a152274283105e5.lean#L169).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7a3a4701cef8979e811839c42115da9add5faef8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
