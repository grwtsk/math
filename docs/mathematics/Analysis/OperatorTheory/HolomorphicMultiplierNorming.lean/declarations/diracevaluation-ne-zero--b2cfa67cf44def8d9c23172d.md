## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d598ebd2-09ab-d3b4-9358-8331bd027f37`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 202–211.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem diracEvaluation_ne_zero (D : IndexedDomainCover ι) (hOpen : D.IsOpenCover)
    (x : D.X.carrier) : diracEvaluation D hOpen x ≠ 0 := by
  intro h
  let s := diracFiniteSection (MetricWeights.identity D) hOpen
    (scalarSection D hOpen (constantSection D.X 1)) x
  have he := congrArg (fun T : SectionQuotient (MetricWeights.identity D) (Measure.dirac x)
      hOpen →L[ℂ] ℂ => T (classOf (MetricWeights.identity D) (Measure.dirac x) hOpen s)) h
  change (1 : ℂ) = 0 at he
  exact one_ne_zero he

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/OperatorTheory/HolomorphicMultiplierNorming.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Operator/HolomorphicMultiplierNorming.lean#L202).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aac63e791fc42f87e7ec9873699d57cd343389f6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
