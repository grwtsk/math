## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2846241ade40b9dd52f44b2df642d5f5f0b5b071219d25ad2938f8ed67f9f4eb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 220–232.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def pointPort (W : CircleWindow D.X) (hOpen : D.IsOpenCover)
    (s : FiniteEnergySection (MetricWeights.identity D) (areaMeasure D.X) hOpen)
    (hs : s.1.value W.centerPoint ≠ 0) :
    PointEvaluationPort (MetricWeights.identity D) (areaMeasure D.X) hOpen W.centerPoint where
  functional := functional W hOpen
  on_class _ := rfl
  nonzero := by
    intro h
    have he := congrArg (fun T : SectionQuotient (MetricWeights.identity D) (areaMeasure D.X)
      hOpen →L[ℂ] ℂ => T (classOf (MetricWeights.identity D) (areaMeasure D.X) hOpen s)) h
    exact hs he

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/OperatorTheory/HolomorphicMultiplierArea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Operator/HolomorphicMultiplierArea.lean#L220).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f6b98dd105a5d8265111243d4d66188ef5fbd72` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
