## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cdbd0c55a8d1a2c9b0dc9d010dad795b6b51222e8dd5c4af4ba535140be74440`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 26–37.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure CompatibleOperators (C : Cocycle D) where
  localOp : ∀ i, (D.U i).carrier → ℂ →L[ℂ] ℂ
  intertwines : ∀ i j (x : D.X.carrier)
    (hi : x.1 ∈ (D.U i).carrier) (hj : x.1 ∈ (D.U j).carrier) (a : ℂ),
    localOp j ⟨x.1, hj⟩ (C.scalar i j x * a) =
      C.scalar i j x * localOp i ⟨x.1, hi⟩ a

namespace CompatibleOperators

variable {C : Cocycle D}

/-- The operator on the exact fiber, in the preferred chart chosen by the bundle core. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/OperatorTheory/HolomorphicLinePort.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Operator/HolomorphicLinePort.lean#L26).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `82ebbad5093612f7505b5f07c99668c7ae5b5db1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
