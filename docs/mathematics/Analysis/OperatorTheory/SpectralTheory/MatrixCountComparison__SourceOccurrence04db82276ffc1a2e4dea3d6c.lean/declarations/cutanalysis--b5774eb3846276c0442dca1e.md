## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:2ffcf716ced27fd873e3cc66172d2b2a7a934f0f2043732016b8d9ef3e407068`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 133–141.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private def cutAnalysis (b : OrthonormalBasis ι ℝ (EuclideanSpace ℝ ι))
    (s : Finset ι) : EuclideanSpace ℝ ι →ₗ[ℝ] (s → ℝ) where
  toFun v i := b.repr v i
  map_add' v w := by ext i; simp
  map_smul' c v := by ext i; simp

/-- Quadratic comparison gives the reversed inclusive eigenvalue-count comparison.
The proof projects the low-energy subspace of B into that of A and proves
injectivity by the quadratic-form contradiction; no min-max oracle is assumed. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/OperatorTheory/SpectralTheory/MatrixCountComparison__SourceOccurrence04db82276ffc1a2e4dea3d6c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/OperatorTheory/SpectralTheory/MatrixCountComparison.lean#L133).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `88de4aff802aae87fbf78dd2b6f080e2ac222df8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
