## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:40bf5b7f-d4ee-8ded-e9e8-57e85bfe5a21`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 231–249.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem transport_tau_intertwines
    (sheaf : JetSheaf Vertex P order)
    {source target : Vertex} (path : Path sheaf.edge source target) :
    sheaf.transport path * ((sheaf.synchronized source).actions).tau =
      ((sheaf.synchronized target).actions).tau * sheaf.transport path := by
  induction path with
  | single arrow =>
      simpa [transport] using sheaf.tau_intertwines arrow
  | tail path arrow inductionHypothesis =>
      simp only [transport]
      rw [Matrix.mul_assoc, inductionHypothesis, ← Matrix.mul_assoc,
        sheaf.tau_intertwines arrow, Matrix.mul_assoc]

end JetSheaf

vertex. The sheaf itself already certifies transport of the effective pencil and all jets. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/OperatorTheory/SpectralTheory/Sheaf/SynchronizedSchurJet.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Spectral/Sheaf/SynchronizedSchurJet.lean#L231).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1decd0fe306f36157a1acfef1b12a92440e5066e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
