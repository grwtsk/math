## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:006c142e-8114-dd84-2485-7457cbfb901a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 841–845.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem continuous_setToFun (hT : DominatedFinMeasAdditive μ T C) :
    Continuous fun f : α →₁[μ] E => setToFun μ T hT f := by
  simp_rw [L1.setToFun_eq_setToL1 hT]; exact ContinuousLinearMap.continuous _

/-- If `F i → f` in `L1`, then `setToFun μ T hT (F i) → setToFun μ T hT f`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SetToL1/Variant7d42fa542943f7a56d934b398f15d0c2346b98f78a348c29bd5971eaad48bed5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SetToL1/Variant7d42fa542943f7a56d934b398f15d0c2346b98f78a348c29bd5971eaad48bed5.lean#L841).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b1067cf709788585afaa83f2525d72a7ea482127` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
