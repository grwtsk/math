## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:56f2b0590ee7aba06ae138f3b0df15ebe05f5c4c1cef00eb61dd8abfed46ef18`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 183–189.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mutuallySingularSet (κ η : Kernel α γ) : Set (α × γ) := {p | 1 ≤ rnDerivAux κ (κ + η) p.1 p.2}

/-- A set of points in `α × γ` related to the absolute continuity / mutual singularity of
`κ` and `η`. That is,
* `withDensity η (rnDeriv κ η) a (mutuallySingularSetSlice κ η a) = 0`,
* `singularPart κ η a (mutuallySingularSetSlice κ η a)ᶜ = 0`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/RadonNikodym/Variante8da09304f743f876989370359deca9236c7bc0af19754643e01522c384a9982.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/RadonNikodym/Variante8da09304f743f876989370359deca9236c7bc0af19754643e01522c384a9982.lean#L183).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `15b5289d204c14c22bccd67a5b3a396fc7501f15` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
