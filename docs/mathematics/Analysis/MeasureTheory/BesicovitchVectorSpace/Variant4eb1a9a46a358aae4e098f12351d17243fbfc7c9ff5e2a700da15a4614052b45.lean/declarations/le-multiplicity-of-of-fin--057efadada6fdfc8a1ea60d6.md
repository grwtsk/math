## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:cff2eb91-5914-2c26-97b9-c44bc25421c8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 272–315.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Relating satellite configurations to separated points in the ball of radius `2`.

We prove that the number of points in a satellite configuration is bounded by the maximal number
of `1`-separated points in the ball of radius `2`. For this, start from a satellite configuration
`c`. Without loss of generality, one can assume that the last ball is centered at `0` and of
radius `1`. Define `c' i = c i` if `‖c i‖ ≤ 2`, and `c' i = (2/‖c i‖) • c i` if `‖c i‖ > 2`.
It turns out that these points are `1 - δ`-separated, where `δ` is arbitrarily small if `τ` is
close enough to `1`. The number of such configurations is bounded by `multiplicity E` if `δ` is
suitably small.

To check that the points `c' i` are `1 - δ`-separated, one treats separately the cases where
both `‖c i‖` and `‖c j‖` are `≤ 2`, where one of them is `≤ 2` and the other one is `> 2`, and
where both of them are `> 2`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/BesicovitchVectorSpace/Variant4eb1a9a46a358aae4e098f12351d17243fbfc7c9ff5e2a700da15a4614052b45.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision
