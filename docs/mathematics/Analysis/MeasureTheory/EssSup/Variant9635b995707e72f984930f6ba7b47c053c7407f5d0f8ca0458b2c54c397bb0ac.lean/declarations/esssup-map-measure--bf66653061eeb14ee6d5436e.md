## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2bb12d5d-e54e-862d-1e84-9c9f63a5ba9a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 257–272.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem essSup_map_measure (hg : AEMeasurable g (Measure.map f μ)) (hf : AEMeasurable f μ) :
    essSup g (Measure.map f μ) = essSup (g ∘ f) μ := by
  rw [essSup_congr_ae hg.ae_eq_mk, essSup_map_measure_of_measurable hg.measurable_mk hf]
  refine essSup_congr_ae ?_
  have h_eq := ae_of_ae_map hf hg.ae_eq_mk
  rw [← EventuallyEq] at h_eq
  exact h_eq.symm

end TopologicalSpace

end CompleteLattice

namespace ENNReal

variable {f : α → ℝ≥0∞}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/EssSup/Variant9635b995707e72f984930f6ba7b47c053c7407f5d0f8ca0458b2c54c397bb0ac.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/EssSup/Variant9635b995707e72f984930f6ba7b47c053c7407f5d0f8ca0458b2c54c397bb0ac.lean#L257).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `074b572fdabd4673ffb9394d63b6fa73193e3c9e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
