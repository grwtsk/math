## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e59cf8b3-3e5e-5f34-f2e5-88161603103f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 3442–3453.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem countable_meas_level_set_pos {α β : Type*} [MeasurableSpace α] {μ : Measure α}
    [SigmaFinite μ] [MeasurableSpace β] [MeasurableSingletonClass β] {g : α → β}
    (g_mble : Measurable g) : Set.Countable { t : β | 0 < μ { a : α | g a = t } } :=
  haveI level_sets_disjoint : Pairwise (Disjoint on fun t : β => { a : α | g a = t }) :=
    fun s t hst => Disjoint.preimage g (disjoint_singleton.mpr hst)

#align measure_theory.measure.countable_meas_level_set_pos MeasureTheory.Measure.countable_meas_level_set_pos

/-- If a set `t` is covered by a countable family of finite measure sets, then its measurable
superset `toMeasurable μ t` (which has the same measure as `t`) satisfies,
for any measurable set `s`, the equality `μ (toMeasurable μ t ∩ s) = μ (t ∩ s)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpace/Variant0789f8964826ec1aca8d06da1dbefdf3266055be2aba35d9cdde56c309122683.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpace/Variant0789f8964826ec1aca8d06da1dbefdf3266055be2aba35d9cdde56c309122683.lean#L3442).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0588602c394b79b9ab0b5bd11ed4cb6579bbc7ff` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
