## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3ba13334-fc34-3116-5fc3-a2091feae186`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1164–1181.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sum_apply₀ (f : ι → Measure α) {s : Set α} (hs : NullMeasurableSet s (sum f)) :
    sum f s = ∑' i, f i s := by
  apply le_antisymm ?_ (le_sum_apply _ _)
  rcases hs.exists_measurable_subset_ae_eq with ⟨t, ts, t_meas, ht⟩
  calc
  sum f s = sum f t := measure_congr ht.symm
  _ = ∑' i, f i t := sum_apply _ t_meas
  _ ≤ ∑' i, f i s := ENNReal.tsum_le_tsum fun i ↦ measure_mono ts

/-! For the next theorem, the countability assumption is necessary. For a counterexample, consider
an uncountable space, with a distinguished point `x₀`, and the sigma-algebra made of countable sets
not containing `x₀`, and their complements. All points but `x₀` are measurable.
Consider the sum of the Dirac masses at points different from `x₀`, and `s = {x₀}`. For any Dirac
mass `δ_x`, we have `δ_x (x₀) = 0`, so `∑' x, δ_x (x₀) = 0`. On the other hand, the measure
`sum δ_x` gives mass one to each point different from `x₀`, so it gives infinite mass to any
measurable set containing `x₀` (as such a set is uncountable), and by outer regularity one gets
`sum δ_x {x₀} = ∞`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpace/Variant11f06db20020f58942c63200d3b5f3d0e2556399e640f9bf741a6b5a871760f2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpace/Variant11f06db20020f58942c63200d3b5f3d0e2556399e640f9bf741a6b5a871760f2.lean#L1164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dca30b1d758d93654e41f7211c74274b90412ce6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
