## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3e202231-c60c-669c-9d21-fcbbf50ab9ac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 169–182.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measurableSet_le {f g : δ → α} (hf : Measurable f) (hg : Measurable g) :
    MeasurableSet { a | f a ≤ g a } :=
  hf.prodMk hg measurableSet_le'

end PartialOrder

section LinearOrder

variable [LinearOrder α] [OrderClosedTopology α] {a b x : α} {μ : Measure α}

-- we open this locale only here to avoid issues with list being treated as intervals above

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Order/Variant49d2edd2474e12e4707a4fe9054f8427a5e7a8576ad6eda5fd2eb1f4295576d3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Order/Variant49d2edd2474e12e4707a4fe9054f8427a5e7a8576ad6eda5fd2eb1f4295576d3.lean#L169).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `92836497e9d56f47a80a1027b3d598575c1c5761` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
