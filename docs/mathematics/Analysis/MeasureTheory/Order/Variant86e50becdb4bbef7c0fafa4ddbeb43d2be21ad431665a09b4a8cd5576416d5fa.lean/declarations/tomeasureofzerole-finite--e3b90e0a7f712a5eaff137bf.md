## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dd784f37e8a5b4e55c4f8dd090980ccd92977481016a6ed64ea67f29c1ecddac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 308–314.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance toMeasureOfZeroLE_finite (hi : 0 ≤[i] s) (hi₁ : MeasurableSet i) :
    IsFiniteMeasure (s.toMeasureOfZeroLE i hi₁ hi) where
  measure_univ_lt_top := by
    rw [toMeasureOfZeroLE_apply s hi hi₁ MeasurableSet.univ]
    exact ENNReal.coe_lt_top

/-- `SignedMeasure.toMeasureOfLEZero` is a finite measure. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Order/Variant86e50becdb4bbef7c0fafa4ddbeb43d2be21ad431665a09b4a8cd5576416d5fa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Order/Variant86e50becdb4bbef7c0fafa4ddbeb43d2be21ad431665a09b4a8cd5576416d5fa.lean#L308).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `602ee5467d07171d5b737c437b08ba4cb775ce70` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
