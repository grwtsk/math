## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d94ff129f12b512c8bf8d7e94f465ac308ef7192cea0a9f93866812172cb5803`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1063–1076.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def AbsolutelyContinuous (v : VectorMeasure α M) (w : VectorMeasure α N) :=
  ∀ ⦃s : Set α⦄, w s = 0 → v s = 0
#align measure_theory.vector_measure.absolutely_continuous MeasureTheory.VectorMeasure.AbsolutelyContinuous

-- mathport name: vector_measure.absolutely_continuous
@[inherit_doc VectorMeasure.AbsolutelyContinuous]
scoped[MeasureTheory] infixl:50 " ≪ᵥ " => MeasureTheory.VectorMeasure.AbsolutelyContinuous

open MeasureTheory

namespace AbsolutelyContinuous

variable {v : VectorMeasure α M} {w : VectorMeasure α N}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/VectorMeasure/Variant580100f6f0205ffe3d1adac1e75d5d1fcadd37155a603c037d173a685bc42f5e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/VectorMeasure/Variant580100f6f0205ffe3d1adac1e75d5d1fcadd37155a603c037d173a685bc42f5e.lean#L1063).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `694b67575ca73381e86004737d448404da573ca8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
