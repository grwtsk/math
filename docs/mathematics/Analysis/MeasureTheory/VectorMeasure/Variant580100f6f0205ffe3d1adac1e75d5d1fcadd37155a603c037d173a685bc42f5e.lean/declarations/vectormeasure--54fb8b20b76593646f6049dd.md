## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:777983dc4378c0a4244206b4ba083d1d42b94f447a1be16bf1d57bf2ac3a939c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 56–69.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure VectorMeasure (α : Type*) [MeasurableSpace α] (M : Type*) [AddCommMonoid M]
  [TopologicalSpace M] where
  measureOf' : Set α → M
  empty' : measureOf' ∅ = 0
  not_measurable' ⦃i : Set α⦄ : ¬MeasurableSet i → measureOf' i = 0
  m_iUnion' ⦃f : ℕ → Set α⦄ : (∀ i, MeasurableSet (f i)) → Pairwise (Disjoint on f) →
    HasSum (fun i => measureOf' (f i)) (measureOf' (⋃ i, f i))
#align measure_theory.vector_measure MeasureTheory.VectorMeasure
#align measure_theory.vector_measure.measure_of' MeasureTheory.VectorMeasure.measureOf'
#align measure_theory.vector_measure.empty' MeasureTheory.VectorMeasure.empty'
#align measure_theory.vector_measure.not_measurable' MeasureTheory.VectorMeasure.not_measurable'
#align measure_theory.vector_measure.m_Union' MeasureTheory.VectorMeasure.m_iUnion'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/VectorMeasure/Variant580100f6f0205ffe3d1adac1e75d5d1fcadd37155a603c037d173a685bc42f5e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/VectorMeasure/Variant580100f6f0205ffe3d1adac1e75d5d1fcadd37155a603c037d173a685bc42f5e.lean#L56).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `694b67575ca73381e86004737d448404da573ca8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
