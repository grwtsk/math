## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:5ab2bb85ff74008b81563f03f37da694bc4fc9c8a906d3d38b80b365042600a3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 652–667.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def mapRangeHom (f : M →+ N) (hf : Continuous f) : VectorMeasure α M →+ VectorMeasure α N where
  toFun v := v.mapRange f hf
  map_zero' := mapRange_zero hf
  map_add' _ _ := mapRange_add hf
#align measure_theory.vector_measure.map_range_hom MeasureTheory.VectorMeasure.mapRangeHom

end ContinuousAdd

section Module

variable {R : Type*} [Semiring R] [Module R M] [Module R N]

variable [ContinuousAdd M] [ContinuousAdd N] [ContinuousConstSMul R M] [ContinuousConstSMul R N]

/-- Given a continuous linear map `f : M → N`, `mapRangeₗ` is the linear map mapping the
vector measure `v` on `M` to the vector measure `f ∘ v` on `N`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/VectorMeasure/Variant90fbfea3c848c0503f723cd7d8310cdb0696ed1a466c3279dd9fb5fe2a04acb7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/VectorMeasure/Variant90fbfea3c848c0503f723cd7d8310cdb0696ed1a466c3279dd9fb5fe2a04acb7.lean#L652).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1bc7047d4e9c89a107ff3c8d23514847ae0ce913` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
