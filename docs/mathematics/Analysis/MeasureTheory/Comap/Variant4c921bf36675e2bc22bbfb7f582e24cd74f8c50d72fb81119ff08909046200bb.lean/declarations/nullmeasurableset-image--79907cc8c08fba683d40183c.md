## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ae932135-6382-436e-d2a9-e5e441ae83fb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 137–147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem NullMeasurableSet.image (f : α → β) (μ : Measure β) (hfi : Injective f)
    (hf : ∀ s, MeasurableSet s → NullMeasurableSet (f '' s) μ)
    (hs : NullMeasurableSet s (μ.comap f)) : NullMeasurableSet (f '' s) μ := by
  refine ⟨toMeasurable μ (f '' toMeasurable (μ.comap f) s), measurableSet_toMeasurable _ _, ?_⟩
  refine EventuallyEq.trans ?_ (NullMeasurableSet.toMeasurable_ae_eq ?_).symm
  swap
  · exact hf _ (measurableSet_toMeasurable _ _)
  have h : toMeasurable (comap f μ) s =ᵐ[comap f μ] s :=
    NullMeasurableSet.toMeasurable_ae_eq hs
  exact ae_eq_image_of_ae_eq_comap f μ hfi hf h.symm

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Comap/Variant4c921bf36675e2bc22bbfb7f582e24cd74f8c50d72fb81119ff08909046200bb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Comap/Variant4c921bf36675e2bc22bbfb7f582e24cd74f8c50d72fb81119ff08909046200bb.lean#L137).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f181997aed3a856293b09a7898036edf1195f738` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
