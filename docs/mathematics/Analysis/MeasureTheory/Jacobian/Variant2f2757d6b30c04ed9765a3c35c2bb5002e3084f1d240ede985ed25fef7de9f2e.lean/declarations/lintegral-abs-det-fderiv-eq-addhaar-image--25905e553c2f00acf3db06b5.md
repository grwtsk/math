## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:77fc9cf9-9f9e-81c5-e576-2c8995a15ce9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1086–1098.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lintegral_abs_det_fderiv_eq_addHaar_image (hs : MeasurableSet s)
    (hf' : ∀ x ∈ s, HasFDerivWithinAt f (f' x) s x) (hf : InjOn f s) :
    (∫⁻ x in s, ENNReal.ofReal |(f' x).det| ∂μ) = μ (f '' s) :=
  le_antisymm (lintegral_abs_det_fderiv_le_addHaar_image μ hs hf' hf)
    (addHaar_image_le_lintegral_abs_det_fderiv μ hs hf')

/-- Change of variable formula for differentiable functions, set version: if a function `f` is
injective and differentiable on a measurable set `s`, then the pushforward of the measure with
density `|(f' x).det|` on `s` is the Lebesgue measure on the image set. This version requires
that `f` is measurable, as otherwise `Measure.map f` is zero per our definitions.
For a version without measurability assumption but dealing with the restricted
function `s.restrict f`, see `restrict_map_withDensity_abs_det_fderiv_eq_addHaar`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Jacobian/Variant2f2757d6b30c04ed9765a3c35c2bb5002e3084f1d240ede985ed25fef7de9f2e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Jacobian/Variant2f2757d6b30c04ed9765a3c35c2bb5002e3084f1d240ede985ed25fef7de9f2e.lean#L1086).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f7cad2063b178cca3d9a88bb2ae37986675b0814` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
