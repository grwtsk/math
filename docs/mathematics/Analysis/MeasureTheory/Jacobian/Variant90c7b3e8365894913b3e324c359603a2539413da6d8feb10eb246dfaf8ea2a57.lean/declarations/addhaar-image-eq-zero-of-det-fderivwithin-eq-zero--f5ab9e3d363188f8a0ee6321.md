## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ae47cb8e-8101-e9d2-99f4-a817873f1ffc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 646–686.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

### Weak measurability statements

We show that the derivative of a function on a set is almost everywhere measurable, and that the
image `f '' s` is measurable if `f` is injective on `s`. The latter statement follows from the
Lusin-Souslin theorem.
-/


/-- The derivative of a function on a measurable set is almost everywhere measurable on this set
with respect to Lebesgue measure. Note that, in general, it is not genuinely measurable there,
as `f'` is not unique (but only on a set of measure `0`, as the argument shows). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Jacobian/Variant90c7b3e8365894913b3e324c359603a2539413da6d8feb10eb246dfaf8ea2a57.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Jacobian/Variant90c7b3e8365894913b3e324c359603a2539413da6d8feb10eb246dfaf8ea2a57.lean#L646).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
