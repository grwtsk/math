## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a0978590-3a1a-f3b6-517f-81f3481d2e64`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 709–765.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem aemeasurable_fderivWithin (hs : MeasurableSet s)
    (hf' : ∀ x ∈ s, HasFDerivWithinAt f (f' x) s x) : AEMeasurable f' (μ.restrict s) := by
  /- It suffices to show that `f'` can be uniformly approximated by a measurable function.
    Fix `ε > 0`. Thanks to `exists_partition_approximatesLinearOn_of_hasFDerivWithinAt`, one
    can find a countable measurable partition of `s` into sets `s ∩ t n` on which `f` is well
    approximated by linear maps `A n`. On almost all of `s ∩ t n`, it follows from
    `ApproximatesLinearOn.norm_fderiv_sub_le` that `f'` is uniformly approximated by `A n`, which
    gives the conclusion. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Jacobian/Variant8faade64d74755eb59a54011ac4f5c7fdc04acbf23f5a84015b8c0556a55b4a8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Jacobian/Variant8faade64d74755eb59a54011ac4f5c7fdc04acbf23f5a84015b8c0556a55b4a8.lean#L709).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f39c34da90f57127c1bfa0b8c7576e29e66d2677` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
