## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7b16ac20-bc6d-46e5-7af2-4fec95383c8f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 187–194.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem seqTendstoAeSeq_spec (hfg : TendstoInMeasure μ f atTop g) (n k : ℕ)
    (hn : seqTendstoAeSeq hfg n ≤ k) :
    μ { x | (2 : ℝ)⁻¹ ^ n ≤ dist (f k x) (g x) } ≤ (2 : ℝ≥0∞)⁻¹ ^ n := by
  cases n
  · exact Classical.choose_spec (exists_nat_measure_lt_two_inv hfg 0) k hn
  · exact Classical.choose_spec
      (exists_nat_measure_lt_two_inv hfg _) _ (le_trans (le_max_left _ _) hn)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/ConvergenceInMeasure/Varianta78418b25dcc481019b63eda2b5f73891666e865115f4088c901aa8d74d56aa9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/ConvergenceInMeasure/Varianta78418b25dcc481019b63eda2b5f73891666e865115f4088c901aa8d74d56aa9.lean#L187).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `abe8c6ec3bb621a51511053bc209f63cfa1a03eb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
