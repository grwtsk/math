## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:768f4abc-45d7-3d3b-0705-66a981aa49ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 104–117.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma tendstoInMeasure_iff_dist [PseudoMetricSpace E] {f : ι → α → E} {l : Filter ι} {g : α → E} :
    TendstoInMeasure μ f l g
      ↔ ∀ ε, 0 < ε → Tendsto (fun i => μ { x | ε ≤ dist (f i x) (g x) }) l (𝓝 0) := by
  refine ⟨fun h ε hε ↦ ?_, fun h ↦ ?_⟩

    rw [edist_dist, ENNReal.ofReal_le_ofReal_iff (by positivity)]
  · refine tendstoInMeasure_of_ne_top fun ε hε hε_top ↦ ?_
    convert! h ε.toReal (ENNReal.toReal_pos hε.ne' hε_top) with i a
    rw [edist_dist, ENNReal.le_ofReal_iff_toReal_le hε_top (by positivity)]

/-- `TendstoInMeasure` expressed with the real-valued measure of a set defined with a distance.

The `IsFiniteMeasure` hypothesis is necessary, otherwise `μ.real {...}` could be zero because
the measure of the set is infinite. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/ConvergenceInMeasure/Variant21574b5baf6e895fe1160689bd0b15f31140173e69b79246de923702456d69ba.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/ConvergenceInMeasure/Variant21574b5baf6e895fe1160689bd0b15f31140173e69b79246de923702456d69ba.lean#L104).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ea81916c9b9bb173df04ddb5f9933c88f7b9a3de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
