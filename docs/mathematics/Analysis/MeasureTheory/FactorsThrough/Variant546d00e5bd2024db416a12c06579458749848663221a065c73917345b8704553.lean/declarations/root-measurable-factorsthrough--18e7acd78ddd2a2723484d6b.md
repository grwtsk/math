## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6694e5f3-3dae-7906-278f-d66b8953250b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 33–44.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem _root_.Measurable.factorsThrough [MeasurableSpace Z] [MeasurableSingletonClass Z]
    (hg : Measurable[mY.comap f] g) : g.FactorsThrough f := by
  refine fun x₁ x₂ h ↦ eq_of_mem_singleton ?_
  obtain ⟨s, -, hs⟩ := hg (measurableSet_singleton (g x₂))
  rw [← mem_preimage, ← hs, mem_preimage, h, ← mem_preimage, hs, mem_preimage, mem_singleton_iff]

/-- If a function `g` is strongly measurable with respect to the pullback along some function `f`,
then to prove `g x = g y` it is enough to prove `f x = f y`.

If `Z` is not empty there exists `h : Y → Z` such that `g = h ∘ f`.
If `Z` is also completely metrizable, the factorization map `h` can be taken to be measurable
(see `exists_eq_measurable_comp`). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/FactorsThrough/Variant546d00e5bd2024db416a12c06579458749848663221a065c73917345b8704553.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/FactorsThrough/Variant546d00e5bd2024db416a12c06579458749848663221a065c73917345b8704553.lean#L33).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f4041188e7c8e88681f031058a7c70c7cc75b55` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
