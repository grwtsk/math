## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1b01af31-ecdb-f7b2-fcbc-f3ab6d6e4632`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 533–537.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem union_ae_eq_univ_of_ae_eq_univ_right (h : t =ᵐ[μ] univ) : (s ∪ t : Set α) =ᵐ[μ] univ := by
  convert ae_eq_set_union (ae_eq_refl s) h
  rw [union_univ]
#align measure_theory.union_ae_eq_univ_of_ae_eq_univ_right MeasureTheory.union_ae_eq_univ_of_ae_eq_univ_right

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpaceDef/Variant4aefc02d6992b032e67ff58238c3a23909390c3b44cdc482b5d1ad897ae9ffc5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpaceDef/Variant4aefc02d6992b032e67ff58238c3a23909390c3b44cdc482b5d1ad897ae9ffc5.lean#L533).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c9db1071975b1db5eb00545da8ce2a19f5df1341` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
