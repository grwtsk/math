## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:575a1b4d49c49da80571563228f0f64a83fea05e7295a1d55d59edceb45096b4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 118–130.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ofMeasurable (m : ∀ s : Set α, MeasurableSet s → ℝ≥0∞) (m0 : m ∅ MeasurableSet.empty = 0)
    (mU :
      ∀ ⦃f : ℕ → Set α⦄ (h : ∀ i, MeasurableSet (f i)),
        Pairwise (Disjoint on f) → m (⋃ i, f i) (MeasurableSet.iUnion h) = ∑' i, m (f i) (h i)) :
    Measure α :=
  { toOuterMeasure := inducedOuterMeasure m _ m0
    m_iUnion := fun f hf hd =>
      show inducedOuterMeasure m _ m0 (iUnion f) = ∑' i, inducedOuterMeasure m _ m0 (f i) by
        rw [inducedOuterMeasure_eq m0 mU, mU hf hd]
        congr; funext n; rw [inducedOuterMeasure_eq m0 mU]
    trim_le := le_inducedOuterMeasure.2 fun s hs ↦ by
      rw [OuterMeasure.trim_eq _ hs, inducedOuterMeasure_eq m0 mU hs] }

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpaceDef/Varianta683e8592259704be6e120fc24fbb4f87f30d99ca54ff4ea82158d01bf47c280.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpaceDef/Varianta683e8592259704be6e120fc24fbb4f87f30d99ca54ff4ea82158d01bf47c280.lean#L118).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c6674126d2dcbdac273c343fd1342337aabf2dc1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
