## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:717cdca0f3d6544de905f3b1122fe200f478373014ab38567aad292e8e338ac0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 334–357.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class MeasureSpace (α : Type*) extends MeasurableSpace α where
  volume : Measure α

export MeasureSpace (volume)

/-- `volume` is the canonical measure on `α`. -/
add_decl_doc volume

section MeasureSpace

/-- `∀ᵐ a, p a` means that `p a` for a.e. `a`, i.e. `p` holds true away from a null set.

This is notation for `Filter.Eventually P (MeasureTheory.ae MeasureSpace.volume)`. -/
notation3 "∀ᵐ "(...)", "r:(scoped P =>
  Filter.Eventually P <| MeasureTheory.ae MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace.volume) => r

/-- `∃ᵐ a, p a` means that `p` holds frequently, i.e. on a set of positive measure,
w.r.t. the volume measure.

This is notation for `Filter.Frequently P (MeasureTheory.ae MeasureSpace.volume)`. -/
notation3 "∃ᵐ "(...)", "r:(scoped P =>
  Filter.Frequently P <| MeasureTheory.ae MeasureTheory.MeasureSpace.volume) => r

/-- The tactic `exact volume`, to be used in optional (`autoParam`) arguments. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpaceDef/Varianta683e8592259704be6e120fc24fbb4f87f30d99ca54ff4ea82158d01bf47c280.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpaceDef/Varianta683e8592259704be6e120fc24fbb4f87f30d99ca54ff4ea82158d01bf47c280.lean#L334).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c6674126d2dcbdac273c343fd1342337aabf2dc1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
