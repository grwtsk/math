## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0c265003-0596-4dda-f71e-2c13a4660ddd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 139–147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ofMeasurable_apply {m : ∀ s : Set α, MeasurableSet s → ℝ≥0∞}
    {m0 : m ∅ MeasurableSet.empty = 0}
    {mU :
      ∀ ⦃f : ℕ → Set α⦄ (h : ∀ i, MeasurableSet (f i)),
        Pairwise (Disjoint on f) → m (⋃ i, f i) (MeasurableSet.iUnion h) = ∑' i, m (f i) (h i)}
    (s : Set α) (hs : MeasurableSet s) : ofMeasurable m m0 mU s = m s hs :=
  inducedOuterMeasure_eq m0 mU hs

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpaceDef/Variantcc68c05f586037f6e4d614358d1487bbc63f3dfa6077377f538547f18423facf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpaceDef/Variantcc68c05f586037f6e4d614358d1487bbc63f3dfa6077377f538547f18423facf.lean#L139).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8a4607dc15e429f7164e9a82008c2baf375c582e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
