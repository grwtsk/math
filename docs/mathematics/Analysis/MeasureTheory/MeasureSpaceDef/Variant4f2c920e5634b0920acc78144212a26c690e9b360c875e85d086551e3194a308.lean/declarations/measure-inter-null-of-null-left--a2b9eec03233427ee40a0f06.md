## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a6ee0edd-b456-7028-13a4-da1e29dc091e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 296–311.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measure_inter_null_of_null_left {S : Set α} (T : Set α) (h : μ S = 0) : μ (S ∩ T) = 0 :=
  measure_mono_null inter_subset_left h

/-! ### The almost everywhere filter -/
section ae

/-- Given a predicate on `β` and `Set α` where both `α` and `β` are measurable spaces, if the
predicate holds for almost every `x : β` and
- `∅ : Set α`
- a family of sets generating the σ-algebra of `α`

Moreover, if for almost every `x : β`, the predicate is closed under complements and countable
disjoint unions, then the predicate holds for almost every `x : β` and all measurable sets of `α`.

This is an AE version of `MeasurableSpace.induction_on_inter` where the condition is dependent
on a measurable space `β`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpaceDef/Variant4f2c920e5634b0920acc78144212a26c690e9b360c875e85d086551e3194a308.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpaceDef/Variant4f2c920e5634b0920acc78144212a26c690e9b360c875e85d086551e3194a308.lean#L296).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3ddad316ba66b1c503e888ee7536ffd921036743` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
