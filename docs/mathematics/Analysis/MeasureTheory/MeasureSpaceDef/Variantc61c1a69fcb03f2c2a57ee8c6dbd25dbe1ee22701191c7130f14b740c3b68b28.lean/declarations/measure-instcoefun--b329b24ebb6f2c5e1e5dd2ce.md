## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:51517af420a803090d45771decd6099ec644464c85b8f41c0ccf70153eea3160`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–102.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Measure.instCoeFun [MeasurableSpace α] : CoeFun (Measure α) fun _ => Set α → ℝ≥0∞ :=
  ⟨fun m => m.toOuterMeasure⟩
#align measure_theory.measure.has_coe_to_fun MeasureTheory.Measure.instCoeFun

attribute [coe] Measure.toOuterMeasure

section

variable [MeasurableSpace α] {μ μ₁ μ₂ : Measure α} {s s₁ s₂ t : Set α}

namespace Measure

/-! ### General facts about measures -/


/-- Obtain a measure by giving a countably additive function that sends `∅` to `0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpaceDef/Variantc61c1a69fcb03f2c2a57ee8c6dbd25dbe1ee22701191c7130f14b740c3b68b28.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasureSpaceDef/Variantc61c1a69fcb03f2c2a57ee8c6dbd25dbe1ee22701191c7130f14b740c3b68b28.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4f75ae805e91dcaa90a8216feb2c705896c5bdf4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
