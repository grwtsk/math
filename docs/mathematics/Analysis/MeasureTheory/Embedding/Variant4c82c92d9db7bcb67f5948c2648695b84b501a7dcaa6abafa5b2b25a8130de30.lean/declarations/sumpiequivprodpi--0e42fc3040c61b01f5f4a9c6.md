## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8807dc7c7b94fc2320fa817284b28b08f5f853530bd3784f99c6ebfef9d16528`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 583–592.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def sumPiEquivProdPi (α : δ ⊕ δ' → Type*) [∀ i, MeasurableSpace (α i)] :
    (∀ i, α i) ≃ᵐ (∀ i, α (.inl i)) × ∀ i', α (.inr i') where
  __ := Equiv.sumPiEquivProdPi α
  measurable_toFun := by
    apply Measurable.prod <;> rw [measurable_pi_iff] <;> rintro i <;> apply measurable_pi_apply
  measurable_invFun := by
    rw [measurable_pi_iff]; rintro (i | i)
    · exact measurable_pi_iff.1 measurable_fst _
    · exact measurable_pi_iff.1 measurable_snd _

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Embedding/Variant4c82c92d9db7bcb67f5948c2648695b84b501a7dcaa6abafa5b2b25a8130de30.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Embedding/Variant4c82c92d9db7bcb67f5948c2648695b84b501a7dcaa6abafa5b2b25a8130de30.lean#L583).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c4b0164c0626b8bd3488ebd043972ba582971882` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
