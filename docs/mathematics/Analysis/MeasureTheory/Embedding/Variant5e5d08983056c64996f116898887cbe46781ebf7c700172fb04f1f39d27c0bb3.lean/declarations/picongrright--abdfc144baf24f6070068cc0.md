## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8173699bb38f2f8d42318065813a053c588f4a71087034a80821d598875b7f6e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 488–494.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def piCongrRight (e : ∀ a, π a ≃ᵐ π' a) : (∀ a, π a) ≃ᵐ ∀ a, π' a where
  toEquiv := .piCongrRight fun a => (e a).toEquiv
  measurable_toFun := .of_eval fun i => (e i).measurable_toFun.comp (measurable_pi_apply i)
  measurable_invFun := .of_eval fun i => (e i).measurable_invFun.comp (measurable_pi_apply i)

variable (π) in
/-- Moving a dependent type along an equivalence of coordinates, as a measurable equivalence. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Embedding/Variant5e5d08983056c64996f116898887cbe46781ebf7c700172fb04f1f39d27c0bb3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Embedding/Variant5e5d08983056c64996f116898887cbe46781ebf7c700172fb04f1f39d27c0bb3.lean#L488).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `575bea33c92b621ceb196eb8bfa36d822435b1be` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
