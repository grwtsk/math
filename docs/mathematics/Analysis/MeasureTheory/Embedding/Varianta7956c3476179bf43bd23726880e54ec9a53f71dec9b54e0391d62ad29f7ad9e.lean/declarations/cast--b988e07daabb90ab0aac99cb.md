## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:3ee01940eaf83466378d1e7f68314098adac424ed2ac762d5fc2a79295508390`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 342–354.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def cast {α β} [i₁ : MeasurableSpace α] [i₂ : MeasurableSpace β] (h : α = β)
    (hi : HEq i₁ i₂) : α ≃ᵐ β where
  toEquiv := Equiv.cast h
  measurable_toFun := by
    subst h
    subst hi
    exact measurable_id
  measurable_invFun := by
    subst h
    subst hi
    exact measurable_id

/-- Measurable equivalence between `ULift α` and `α`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Embedding/Varianta7956c3476179bf43bd23726880e54ec9a53f71dec9b54e0391d62ad29f7ad9e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Embedding/Varianta7956c3476179bf43bd23726880e54ec9a53f71dec9b54e0391d62ad29f7ad9e.lean#L342).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `86e228bab05761eb51499c57c2421600a272af86` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
