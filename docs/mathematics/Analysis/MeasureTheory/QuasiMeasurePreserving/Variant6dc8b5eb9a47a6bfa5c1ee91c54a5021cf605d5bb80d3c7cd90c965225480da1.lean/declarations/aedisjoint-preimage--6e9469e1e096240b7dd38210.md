## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:868bdfce-c2ec-296c-c359-4700f91f3820`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 239–250.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem AEDisjoint.preimage {ν : Measure β} {f : α → β} {s t : Set β} (ht : AEDisjoint ν s t)
    (hf : QuasiMeasurePreserving f μ ν) : AEDisjoint μ (f ⁻¹' s) (f ⁻¹' t) :=
  hf.preimage_null ht

end MeasureTheory

open MeasureTheory

namespace MeasurableEquiv

variable {_ : MeasurableSpace α} [MeasurableSpace β] {μ : Measure α}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/QuasiMeasurePreserving/Variant6dc8b5eb9a47a6bfa5c1ee91c54a5021cf605d5bb80d3c7cd90c965225480da1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/QuasiMeasurePreserving/Variant6dc8b5eb9a47a6bfa5c1ee91c54a5021cf605d5bb80d3c7cd90c965225480da1.lean#L239).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a364adc415248dedf84cd0fbf6e690eda79c5242` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
