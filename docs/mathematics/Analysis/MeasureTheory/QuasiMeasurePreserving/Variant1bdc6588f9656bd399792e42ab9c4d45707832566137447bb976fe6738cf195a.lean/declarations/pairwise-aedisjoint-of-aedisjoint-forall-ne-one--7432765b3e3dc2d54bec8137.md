## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a527dbc7-44f2-0f44-8602-1a1d5ada454a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 199–220.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pairwise_aedisjoint_of_aedisjoint_forall_ne_one {G α : Type*} [Group G] [MulAction G α]
    {_ : MeasurableSpace α} {μ : Measure α} {s : Set α}
    (h_ae_disjoint : ∀ g ≠ (1 : G), AEDisjoint μ (g • s) s)
    (h_qmp : ∀ g : G, QuasiMeasurePreserving (g • ·) μ μ) :
    Pairwise (AEDisjoint μ on fun g : G => g • s) := by
  intro g₁ g₂ hg
  let g := g₂⁻¹ * g₁
  replace hg : g ≠ 1 := by
    rw [Ne, inv_mul_eq_one]
    exact hg.symm
  have : (g₂⁻¹ • ·) ⁻¹' (g • s ∩ s) = g₁ • s ∩ g₂ • s := by
    rw [preimage_eq_iff_eq_image (MulAction.bijective g₂⁻¹), image_smul, smul_set_inter, smul_smul,
      smul_smul, inv_mul_cancel, one_smul]
  change μ (g₁ • s ∩ g₂ • s) = 0
  exact this ▸ (h_qmp g₂⁻¹).preimage_null (h_ae_disjoint g hg)

end Pointwise

end Measure

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/QuasiMeasurePreserving/Variant1bdc6588f9656bd399792e42ab9c4d45707832566137447bb976fe6738cf195a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/QuasiMeasurePreserving/Variant1bdc6588f9656bd399792e42ab9c4d45707832566137447bb976fe6738cf195a.lean#L199).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `160777d96cae18206d5d8335a8fa40441b189bdb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
