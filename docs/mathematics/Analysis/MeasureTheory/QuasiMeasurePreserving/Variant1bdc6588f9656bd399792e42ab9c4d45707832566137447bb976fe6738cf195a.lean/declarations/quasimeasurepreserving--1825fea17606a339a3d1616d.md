## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:dcbe877453ba2528a0400a1d7e5e508f94e45f76056a0330c341c451f07cc86a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 47–57.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure QuasiMeasurePreserving {m0 : MeasurableSpace α} (f : α → β)
  (μa : Measure α := by volume_tac)
  (μb : Measure β := by volume_tac) : Prop where
  protected measurable : Measurable f
  protected absolutelyContinuous : μa.map f ≪ μb

attribute [fun_prop] QuasiMeasurePreserving.measurable

namespace QuasiMeasurePreserving

@[fun_prop]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/QuasiMeasurePreserving/Variant1bdc6588f9656bd399792e42ab9c4d45707832566137447bb976fe6738cf195a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/QuasiMeasurePreserving/Variant1bdc6588f9656bd399792e42ab9c4d45707832566137447bb976fe6738cf195a.lean#L47).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `160777d96cae18206d5d8335a8fa40441b189bdb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
