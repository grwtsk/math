## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:fe7edbab74b6201afd0d52811f27e022f98e053a0fc44cb4cafe13618fb90419`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 171–177.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def ConvolutionExists [Sub G] (f : G → E) (g : G → E') (L : E →L[𝕜] E' →L[𝕜] F)
    (μ : Measure G := by volume_tac) : Prop :=
  ∀ x : G, ConvolutionExistsAt f g x L μ

section ConvolutionExists

variable {L} in
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Convolution/Variantf485fde78c76e2c9b2721b152f345fe103a1e4604cbca7404689b676a9cfeac8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Convolution/Variantf485fde78c76e2c9b2721b152f345fe103a1e4604cbca7404689b676a9cfeac8.lean#L171).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cbfe9c51f48fe1e6f501e0174521e9939c4295b3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
