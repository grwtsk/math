## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:691c9122e52c73023c659bba85ca9a7470d9193bbc658346de0d35cd96ae0de2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1529–1533.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def posConvolution (f : ℝ → E) (g : ℝ → E') (L : E →L[ℝ] E' →L[ℝ] F)
    (ν : MeasureTheory.Measure ℝ := by volume_tac) : ℝ → F :=
  indicator (Ioi (0 : ℝ)) fun x => ∫ t in (0)..x, L (f t) (g (x - t)) ∂ν
#align pos_convolution posConvolution

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Convolution/Variant3e7a61ec35f82621f79d3f41d46641806716e74bfec50033d676c184c0939b08.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Convolution/Variant3e7a61ec35f82621f79d3f41d46641806716e74bfec50033d676c184c0939b08.lean#L1529).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1ee6b93fa3151fc64ec813bc11d12698d80eac3c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
