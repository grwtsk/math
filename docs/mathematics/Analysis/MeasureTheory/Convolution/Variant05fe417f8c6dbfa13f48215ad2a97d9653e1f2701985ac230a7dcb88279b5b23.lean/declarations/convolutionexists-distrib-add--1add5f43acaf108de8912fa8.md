## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:28f07560-faaf-28df-e038-35deebb097b3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 514–519.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ConvolutionExists.distrib_add (hfg : ConvolutionExists f g L μ)
    (hfg' : ConvolutionExists f g' L μ) : f ⋆[L, μ] (g + g') = f ⋆[L, μ] g + f ⋆[L, μ] g' := by
  ext x
  exact (hfg x).distrib_add (hfg' x)
#align convolution_exists.distrib_add ConvolutionExists.distrib_add

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Convolution/Variant05fe417f8c6dbfa13f48215ad2a97d9653e1f2701985ac230a7dcb88279b5b23.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Convolution/Variant05fe417f8c6dbfa13f48215ad2a97d9653e1f2701985ac230a7dcb88279b5b23.lean#L514).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4a985c84eb8940462e2fb30431e25d9e19d34b38` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
