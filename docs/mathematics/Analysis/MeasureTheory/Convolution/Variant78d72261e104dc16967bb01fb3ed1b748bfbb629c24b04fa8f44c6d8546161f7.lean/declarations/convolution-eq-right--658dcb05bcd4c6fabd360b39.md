## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:738a8303-4ded-b57f-fe5b-c6cbfaea8a01`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 718–738.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  have h2 : ∀ t, L (f t) (g (x₀ - t)) = L (f t) (g x₀) := fun t ↦ by

variable [BorelSpace G] [SecondCountableTopology G]
variable [IsAddLeftInvariant μ] [SFinite μ]

/-- Approximate `(f ⋆ g) x₀` if the support of the `f` is bounded within a ball, and `g` is near
`g x₀` on a ball with the same radius around `x₀`. See `dist_convolution_le` for a special case.

We can simplify the second argument of `dist` further if we add some extra type-classes on `E`
and `𝕜` or if `L` is scalar multiplication. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Convolution/Variant78d72261e104dc16967bb01fb3ed1b748bfbb629c24b04fa8f44c6d8546161f7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Convolution/Variant78d72261e104dc16967bb01fb3ed1b748bfbb629c24b04fa8f44c6d8546161f7.lean#L718).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1f00446fb804ab897b9e41b293e1510d1e2cf6f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
