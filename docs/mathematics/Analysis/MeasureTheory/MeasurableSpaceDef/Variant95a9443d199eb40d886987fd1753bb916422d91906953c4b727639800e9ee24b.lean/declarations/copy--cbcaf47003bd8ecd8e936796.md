## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:99ea8b4c9ac9105a990367116ea1361f60462b263e4fe81dbe546b231a47422f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 334–340.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def copy (m : MeasurableSpace α) (p : Set α → Prop) (h : ∀ s, p s ↔ MeasurableSet[m] s) :
    MeasurableSpace α where
  MeasurableSet' := p
  measurableSet_empty := by simpa only [h] using m.measurableSet_empty
  measurableSet_compl := by simpa only [h] using m.measurableSet_compl
  measurableSet_iUnion := by simpa only [h] using m.measurableSet_iUnion

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasurableSpaceDef/Variant95a9443d199eb40d886987fd1753bb916422d91906953c4b727639800e9ee24b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasurableSpaceDef/Variant95a9443d199eb40d886987fd1753bb916422d91906953c4b727639800e9ee24b.lean#L334).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `366f0b8a98e92f3b62e015dde313d5df148e22fa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
