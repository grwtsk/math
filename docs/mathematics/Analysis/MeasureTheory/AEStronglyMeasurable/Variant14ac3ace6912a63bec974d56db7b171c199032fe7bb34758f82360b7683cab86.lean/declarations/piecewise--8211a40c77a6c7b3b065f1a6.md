## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:34cef304-e377-7c3c-c388-e381904529ae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 747–767.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem piecewise {s : Set α} [DecidablePred (· ∈ s)]
    (hs : MeasurableSet s) (hf : AEStronglyMeasurable f (μ.restrict s))
    (hg : AEStronglyMeasurable g (μ.restrict sᶜ)) :
    AEStronglyMeasurable (s.piecewise f g) μ := by
  refine ⟨s.piecewise (hf.mk f) (hg.mk g),
    StronglyMeasurable.piecewise hs hf.stronglyMeasurable_mk hg.stronglyMeasurable_mk, ?_⟩

  · have h := hf.ae_eq_mk
    rw [Filter.EventuallyEq, ae_restrict_iff' hs] at h
    rw [ae_restrict_iff' hs]
    filter_upwards [h] with x hx
    intro hx_mem
    simp only [hx_mem, Set.piecewise_eq_of_mem, hx hx_mem]
  · have h := hg.ae_eq_mk
    rw [Filter.EventuallyEq, ae_restrict_iff' hs.compl] at h
    rw [ae_restrict_iff' hs.compl]
    filter_upwards [h] with x hx
    intro hx_mem
    rw [Set.mem_compl_iff] at hx_mem
    simp only [hx_mem, not_false_eq_true, Set.piecewise_eq_of_notMem, hx hx_mem]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEStronglyMeasurable/Variant14ac3ace6912a63bec974d56db7b171c199032fe7bb34758f82360b7683cab86.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEStronglyMeasurable/Variant14ac3ace6912a63bec974d56db7b171c199032fe7bb34758f82360b7683cab86.lean#L747).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a5eb2e67bf1ad9dfb2928149c16c5a2a148030ea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
