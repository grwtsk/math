## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:aabd2958e9952d6e960a5a43f0f68dc39ac21cf408d48448db3d3c2ba25aa715`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 89–98.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def AEFinStronglyMeasurable
    [Zero β] {_ : MeasurableSpace α} (f : α → β) (μ : Measure α := by volume_tac) : Prop :=
  ∃ g, FinStronglyMeasurable g μ ∧ f =ᵐ[μ] g

end Definitions

namespace FinStronglyMeasurable

variable {m0 : MeasurableSpace α} {μ : Measure α} {f : α → β}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEStronglyMeasurable/Variant292f525131c040eb9404507e527176a39dbf6210d4dbfce9b01a65ae44795235.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEStronglyMeasurable/Variant292f525131c040eb9404507e527176a39dbf6210d4dbfce9b01a65ae44795235.lean#L89).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0830ecae6f2aa6dae41dca994b13ea600690ff24` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
