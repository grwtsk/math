## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e7c128c0-f93e-51eb-3863-f0c53748d296`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 457–469.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem trim_iSup {ι} [Countable ι] (μ : ι → OuterMeasure α) :
    trim (⨆ i, μ i) = ⨆ i, trim (μ i) := by
  simp_rw [← @iSup_plift_down _ ι]
  ext1 s
  obtain ⟨t, _, _, hμt⟩ :=
    exists_measurable_superset_forall_eq_trim
      (Option.elim' (⨆ i, μ (PLift.down i)) (μ ∘ PLift.down)) s
  simp only [Option.forall, Option.elim'] at hμt
  simp only [iSup_apply, ← hμt.1]
  exact iSup_congr hμt.2

/-- The trimmed property of a measure μ states that `μ.toOuterMeasure.trim = μ.toOuterMeasure`.
This theorem shows that a restricted trimmed outer measure is a trimmed outer measure. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Induced/Variant462ac1b7ce07f9dcb8385af294e545d2efd7ad7ec4e8005f110efc296b1646db.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Induced/Variant462ac1b7ce07f9dcb8385af294e545d2efd7ad7ec4e8005f110efc296b1646db.lean#L457).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `be20989f237f5b9a8e8ffc50fcc724de1f965902` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
