## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:89ae66f5ce8f7a11e153110f83869114c4ffb9489268098309c5bacbabd21bb9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 52–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def toSignedMeasure (μ : Measure α) [hμ : IsFiniteMeasure μ] : SignedMeasure α where
  measureOf' s := if MeasurableSet s then μ.real s else 0
  empty' := by simp
  not_measurable' _ hi := ite_eq_right hi
  m_iUnion' f hf₁ hf₂ := by
    simp only [*, MeasurableSet.iUnion hf₁, ite_true, measure_iUnion hf₂ hf₁, measureReal_def]
    rw [ENNReal.tsum_toReal_eq]
    exacts [(summable_measure_toReal hf₁ hf₂).hasSum, fun _ ↦ measure_ne_top _ _]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Operations/Variantec09f8fbbf10b30850c9b117b41b8ca51fbf191db097c5ea011d511dcd535384.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Operations/Variantec09f8fbbf10b30850c9b117b41b8ca51fbf191db097c5ea011d511dcd535384.lean#L52).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9205c48eb761706cc18537e786739a6673faaa89` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
