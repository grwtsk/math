## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:23b7ccca-a2bb-63ce-6c6c-9f6a828a14fb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 156–164.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem map_eq_setLIntegral_pdf {m : MeasurableSpace Ω} (X : Ω → E) (ℙ : Measure Ω)
    (μ : Measure E := by volume_tac) [hX : HasPDF X ℙ μ] {s : Set E}
    (hs : MeasurableSet s) : map X ℙ s = ∫⁻ x in s, pdf X ℙ μ x ∂μ := by
  rw [← withDensity_apply _ hs, map_eq_withDensity_pdf X ℙ μ]

namespace pdf

variable {m : MeasurableSpace Ω} {ℙ : Measure Ω} {μ : Measure E}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Density/Variantdd3de20298ed07083f125c1da0565729cb222667eca704726eebc8f5b7005af7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Density/Variantdd3de20298ed07083f125c1da0565729cb222667eca704726eebc8f5b7005af7.lean#L156).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4e6d89a09bab6774e7b9b6481f048661284e64b7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
