## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8f0f048c-8e5b-1b98-e0d8-6077d9ad173a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 393–402.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (hmeas : StronglyMeasurable f) {ε : ℝ} (hε : 0 < ε) :
    ∃ (δ : ℝ) (_ : 0 < δ), ∀ s, MeasurableSet s → μ s ≤ ENNReal.ofReal δ →
      eLpNorm (s.indicator f) p μ ≤ ENNReal.ofReal ε := by
  obtain ⟨δ, hδpos, hδ⟩ := hf.eLpNorm_indicator_le' hp_one hp_top hmeas (half_pos hε)
  refine ⟨δ, hδpos, fun s hs hμs => le_trans (hδ s hs hμs) ?_⟩

      ENNReal.mul_div_cancel] <;>
    norm_num

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/UniformIntegrable/Variantf28458ca9cb3c798fc6fc7da8dee12662a3d895dce288961fc00fa3d3ad87fd8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/UniformIntegrable/Variantf28458ca9cb3c798fc6fc7da8dee12662a3d895dce288961fc00fa3d3ad87fd8.lean#L393).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7a9e30855e47355f31e5828b2c102ac411718319` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
