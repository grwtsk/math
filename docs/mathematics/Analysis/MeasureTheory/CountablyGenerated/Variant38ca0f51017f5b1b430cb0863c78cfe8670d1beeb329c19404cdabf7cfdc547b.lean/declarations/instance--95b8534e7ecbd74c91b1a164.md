## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:67cc7bf5366688b8f60bdf87c21ad04a7f1f3db5ec46564d579c646d422c0743`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 129–145.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 100) [MeasurableSpace α] [Countable α] : CountablyGenerated α where
  isCountablyGenerated := by
    refine ⟨⋃ y, {measurableAtom y}, countable_iUnion (fun i ↦ countable_singleton _), ?_⟩
    refine le_antisymm ?_ (generateFrom_le (by simp [MeasurableSet.measurableAtom_of_countable]))
    intro s hs
    have : s = ⋃ y ∈ s, measurableAtom y := by
      apply Subset.antisymm
      · intro x hx
        simpa using ⟨x, hx, by simp⟩
      · simp only [iUnion_subset_iff]
        intro x hx
        exact measurableAtom_subset hs hx
    rw [this]
    apply MeasurableSet.biUnion (to_countable s) (fun x _hx ↦ ?_)
    apply measurableSet_generateFrom
    simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CountablyGenerated/Variant38ca0f51017f5b1b430cb0863c78cfe8670d1beeb329c19404cdabf7cfdc547b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CountablyGenerated/Variant38ca0f51017f5b1b430cb0863c78cfe8670d1beeb329c19404cdabf7cfdc547b.lean#L129).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac0bd980ce8cc705b8545067c50c1179c151a466` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
