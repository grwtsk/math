## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dd4cded4-3098-7bf9-0d95-9257b488e1fc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 420–427.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measurable_mapNatBool [MeasurableSpace α] [CountablyGenerated α] :
    Measurable (mapNatBool α) := by
  rw [measurable_pi_iff]
  refine fun n ↦ measurable_to_bool ?_
  simp only [preimage, mem_singleton_iff, mapNatBool,
    Bool.decide_iff, ofPred_mem_eq]
  apply measurableSet_natGeneratingSequence

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CountablyGenerated/Variant38ca0f51017f5b1b430cb0863c78cfe8670d1beeb329c19404cdabf7cfdc547b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CountablyGenerated/Variant38ca0f51017f5b1b430cb0863c78cfe8670d1beeb329c19404cdabf7cfdc547b.lean#L420).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac0bd980ce8cc705b8545067c50c1179c151a466` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
