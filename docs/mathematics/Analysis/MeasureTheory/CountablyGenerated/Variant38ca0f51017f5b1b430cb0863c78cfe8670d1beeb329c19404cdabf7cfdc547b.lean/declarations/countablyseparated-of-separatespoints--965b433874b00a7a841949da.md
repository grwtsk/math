## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e988e75bb84ca14814a1e02e7502d95d6baf7d7b26cb3a23dba6791fc122f037`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 390–401.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance countablySeparated_of_separatesPoints [MeasurableSpace α]
    [h : CountablyGenerated α] [SeparatesPoints α] : CountablySeparated α := by
  rcases h with ⟨b, hbc, hb⟩
  refine ⟨⟨b, hbc, fun t ht ↦ hb.symm ▸ .basic t ht, ?_⟩⟩
  rw [hb] at ‹SeparatesPoints _›
  convert! separating_of_generateFrom b
  simp

variable (α)

/-- If a measurable space admits a countable separating family of measurable sets,
there is a countably generated coarser space which still separates points. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CountablyGenerated/Variant38ca0f51017f5b1b430cb0863c78cfe8670d1beeb329c19404cdabf7cfdc547b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CountablyGenerated/Variant38ca0f51017f5b1b430cb0863c78cfe8670d1beeb329c19404cdabf7cfdc547b.lean#L390).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ac0bd980ce8cc705b8545067c50c1179c151a466` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
