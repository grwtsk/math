## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:34a6b8fc9a80e1e81cae3b3e95c4cf15761efecb989f95281e464cd66b8afbb4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 378–381.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance countablySeparated_subtype_of_hasCountableSeparatingOn
    [MeasurableSpace α] {s : Set α} [h : HasCountableSeparatingOn _ MeasurableSet s] :
    CountablySeparated s := CountablySeparated.subtype_iff.mpr h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CountablyGenerated/Variant3ef89e992c3fe49d58030ce9be724d262b3f2c26f627f8d164b2bf5489d222bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CountablyGenerated/Variant3ef89e992c3fe49d58030ce9be724d262b3f2c26f627f8d164b2bf5489d222bd.lean#L378).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f838ef8d8dea25a4905b99b4890c50197d2e8331` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
