## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a397a476-096c-66b4-99ac-2d7058a32d74`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1003–1008.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lintegral_prod_swap [SFinite μ] (f : α × β → ℝ≥0∞) :
    ∫⁻ z, f z.swap ∂ν.prod μ = ∫⁻ z, f z ∂μ.prod ν :=
  measurePreserving_swap.lintegral_comp_emb MeasurableEquiv.prodComm.measurableEmbedding f

/-- **Tonelli's Theorem**: For `ℝ≥0∞`-valued almost everywhere measurable functions on `α × β`,
  the integral of `f` is equal to the iterated integral. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variant62b4007fc8e0a0ddca557fcdacbe649752764d09c7a97763a5450146cb9d03c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variant62b4007fc8e0a0ddca557fcdacbe649752764d09c7a97763a5450146cb9d03c9.lean#L1003).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dcda187671ab2b4ded4e301fb30ca0391eb41c3b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
