## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d520fc81-ba38-e049-8337-6def4ce37139`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 881–904.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem skew_product [SFinite μa] [SFinite μc] {f : α → β} (hf : MeasurePreserving f μa μb)
    {g : α → γ → δ} (hgm : Measurable (uncurry g)) (hg : ∀ᵐ a ∂μa, map (g a) μc = μd) :
    MeasurePreserving (fun p : α × γ => (f p.1, g p.1 p.2)) (μa.prod μc) (μb.prod μd) := by
  have : Measurable fun p : α × γ => (f p.1, g p.1 p.2) := (hf.1.comp measurable_fst).prodMk hgm
  use this
  /- if `μa = 0`, then the lemma is trivial, otherwise we can use `hg`
    to deduce `SFinite μd`. -/

/-- If `f : α → β` sends the measure `μa` to `μb` and `g : γ → δ` sends the measure `μc` to `μd`,
then `Prod.map f g` sends `μa.prod μc` to `μb.prod μd`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variant38877124e9460559bc06b09734386b3f28e0cec244bea47c71a6305592e45e00.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variant38877124e9460559bc06b09734386b3f28e0cec244bea47c71a6305592e45e00.lean#L881).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d5794995f907b535da3a0558db8844f3a8c0b8de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
