## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8ec6fbc6-4ce4-dc37-47ba-ccb357f11706`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 192–201.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem prod_apply_le {s : Set (α × β)} (hs : MeasurableSet s) :
    μ.prod ν s ≤ ∫⁻ x, ν (Prod.mk x ⁻¹' s) ∂μ := by
  simp only [Measure.prod, ← map_apply measurable_prodMk_left hs]
  exact bind_apply_le Measurable.map_prodMk_left.aemeasurable hs

/-- For any measures `μ` and `ν` and any sets `s` and `t`,
we have `μ.prod ν (s ×ˢ t) ≤ μ s * ν t`.

If `ν` is an s-finite measure (which is usually true),
then this inequality becomes an equality, see `prod_prod` below. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variant38877124e9460559bc06b09734386b3f28e0cec244bea47c71a6305592e45e00.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variant38877124e9460559bc06b09734386b3f28e0cec244bea47c71a6305592e45e00.lean#L192).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d5794995f907b535da3a0558db8844f3a8c0b8de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
