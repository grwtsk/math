## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:4c81cc424ca9d71d2ed87d7f7da29f5eb557a54f1c49b0d4835ec1088dd036cc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1058–1065.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance snd.instIsZeroOrProbabilityMeasure [IsZeroOrProbabilityMeasure ρ] :
    IsZeroOrProbabilityMeasure ρ.snd := by
  rcases eq_zero_or_isProbabilityMeasure ρ with h | h
  · simp only [h, snd_zero]
    infer_instance
  · infer_instance

@[simp]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variantb9876717908e8aab9b80f0d641f5717a32d8fe5a16d3215096cd4fd4cd64b105.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variantb9876717908e8aab9b80f0d641f5717a32d8fe5a16d3215096cd4fd4cd64b105.lean#L1058).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `40e0faec880ca5ec0dc3cca09bef3e14d7b48234` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
