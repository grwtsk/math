## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b80ae823-d9a9-d707-48f3-74bc61dabd66`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 402–410.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measurePreserving_prod_div [IsMulRightInvariant ν] :
    MeasurePreserving (fun z : G × G => (z.1, z.2 / z.1)) (μ.prod ν) (μ.prod ν) :=
  (measurePreserving_prod_mul_right μ ν).symm (MeasurableEquiv.shearDivRight G).symm
#align measure_theory.measure_preserving_prod_div MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_prod_div
#align measure_theory.measure_preserving_prod_sub MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_prod_sub

/-- The map `(x, y) ↦ (y, x / y)` sends `μ × ν` to `ν × μ`. -/
@[to_additive measurePreserving_prod_sub_swap
      "The map `(x, y) ↦ (y, x - y)` sends `μ × ν` to `ν × μ`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variant73219930276a4bdf2a997294f8b8ca73ee7a6382d4f77a21a45b5ba61472f47b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variant73219930276a4bdf2a997294f8b8ca73ee7a6382d4f77a21a45b5ba61472f47b.lean#L402).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `16a4065bfb41689e592b6a16c2146123b88df3de` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
