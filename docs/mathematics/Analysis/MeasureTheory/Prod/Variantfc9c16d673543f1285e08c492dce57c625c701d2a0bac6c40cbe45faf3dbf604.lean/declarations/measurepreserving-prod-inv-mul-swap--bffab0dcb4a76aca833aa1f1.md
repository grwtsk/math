## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a663b19b-9e2f-0353-33a6-3b55673f3467`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 137–147.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measurePreserving_prod_inv_mul_swap :
    MeasurePreserving (fun z : G × G => (z.2, z.2⁻¹ * z.1)) (μ.prod ν) (ν.prod μ) :=
  (measurePreserving_prod_inv_mul ν μ).comp measurePreserving_swap
#align measure_theory.measure_preserving_prod_inv_mul_swap MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_prod_inv_mul_swap
#align measure_theory.measure_preserving_prod_neg_add_swap MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_prod_neg_add_swap

/-- The map `(x, y) ↦ (yx, x⁻¹)` is measure-preserving.
This is the function `S⁻¹RSR` in [Halmos, §59],
where `S` is the map `(x, y) ↦ (x, xy)` and `R` is `Prod.swap`. -/

"The map `(x, y) ↦ (y + x, - x)` is measure-preserving."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variantfc9c16d673543f1285e08c492dce57c625c701d2a0bac6c40cbe45faf3dbf604.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variantfc9c16d673543f1285e08c492dce57c625c701d2a0bac6c40cbe45faf3dbf604.lean#L137).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6235d063a20206fcf20a4db10f60203df6b95d4c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
