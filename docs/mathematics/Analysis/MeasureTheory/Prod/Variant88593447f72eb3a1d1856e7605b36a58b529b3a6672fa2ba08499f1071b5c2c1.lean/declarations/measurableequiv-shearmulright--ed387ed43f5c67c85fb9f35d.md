## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8b6b4172555bc07b4a6e25c15f0f8372fa3487c1f95583647ec8e0cd60953cc8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 65–72.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def MeasurableEquiv.shearMulRight [MeasurableInv G] : G × G ≃ᵐ G × G :=
  { Equiv.prodShear (Equiv.refl _) Equiv.mulLeft with
    measurable_toFun := measurable_fst.prodMk measurable_mul
    measurable_invFun := measurable_fst.prodMk <| measurable_fst.inv.mul measurable_snd }

/-- The map `(x, y) ↦ (x, y / x)` as a `MeasurableEquiv` with as inverse `(x, y) ↦ (x, yx)` -/
@[to_additive
"The map `(x, y) ↦ (x, y - x)` as a `MeasurableEquiv` with as inverse `(x, y) ↦ (x, y + x)`."]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variant88593447f72eb3a1d1856e7605b36a58b529b3a6672fa2ba08499f1071b5c2c1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variant88593447f72eb3a1d1856e7605b36a58b529b3a6672fa2ba08499f1071b5c2c1.lean#L65).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d7897f0e8ef08349b61e1897a96c13f7f05274cc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
