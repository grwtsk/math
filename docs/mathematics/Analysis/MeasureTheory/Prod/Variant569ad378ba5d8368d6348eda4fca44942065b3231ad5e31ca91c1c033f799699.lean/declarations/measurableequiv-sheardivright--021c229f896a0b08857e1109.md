## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cab227f5d6f4064fef9b01895d8633f2acf656339c8b645ac699247a6f239546`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–90.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def MeasurableEquiv.shearDivRight [MeasurableInv G] : G × G ≃ᵐ G × G where
  toEquiv := .prodShear (.refl _) .divRight

variable {G}

/-- The multiplicative shear mapping `(x, y) ↦ (x, xy)` preserves the measure `μ × ν`.
This condition is part of the definition of a measurable group in [Halmos, §59].
There, the map in this lemma is called `S`. -/
@[to_additive measurePreserving_prod_add
/-- The shear mapping `(x, y) ↦ (x, x + y)` preserves the measure `μ × ν`. -/]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variant569ad378ba5d8368d6348eda4fca44942065b3231ad5e31ca91c1c033f799699.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Prod/Variant569ad378ba5d8368d6348eda4fca44942065b3231ad5e31ca91c1c033f799699.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `410b654404585236b88a6422692d03d7259f3ef1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
