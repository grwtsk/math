## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:785fdae8-90fd-9b84-f0da-7d4dee8f2287`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 574–586.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eq_rnDeriv₀ [SigmaFinite ν] {s : Measure α} {f : α → ℝ≥0∞}
    (hf : AEMeasurable f ν) (hs : s ⟂ₘ ν) (hadd : μ = s + ν.withDensity f) :
    f =ᵐ[ν] μ.rnDeriv ν :=
  (withDensity_eq_iff_of_sigmaFinite hf (measurable_rnDeriv _ _).aemeasurable).mp
    (eq_withDensity_rnDeriv₀ hf hs hadd)

/-- Given measures `μ` and `ν`, if `s` is a measure mutually singular to `ν` and `f` is a
measurable function such that `μ = s + fν`, then `f = μ.rnDeriv ν`.

This theorem provides the uniqueness of the `rnDeriv` in the Lebesgue decomposition
theorem, while `MeasureTheory.Measure.eq_singularPart` provides the uniqueness of the
`singularPart`. Here, the uniqueness is given in terms of the functions, while the uniqueness in
terms of the functions is given in `eq_withDensity_rnDeriv`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Lebesgue/Variant909ddb8285a2e5b50e8c54a71a9acd04483ab403fe86dea4bc4d52651b028d36.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Lebesgue/Variant909ddb8285a2e5b50e8c54a71a9acd04483ab403fe86dea4bc4d52651b028d36.lean#L574).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1d374cbfb594aecfeda25d42e3b791fa1f8c01cf` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
