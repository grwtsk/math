## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:46bdf4c59518213e090624ec12831c0e4360a9b1eccafb9c990d8e494bc1d806`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 840–852.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def measurableLEEval (μ ν : Measure α) : Set ℝ≥0∞ :=
  (fun f : α → ℝ≥0∞ ↦ ∫⁻ x, f x ∂μ) '' measurableLE μ ν

end LebesgueDecomposition

open LebesgueDecomposition

/-- Any pair of finite measures `μ` and `ν`, `HaveLebesgueDecomposition`. That is to say,
there exist a measure `ξ` and a measurable function `f`, such that `ξ` is mutually singular
with respect to `ν` and `μ = ξ + ν.withDensity f`.

This is not an instance since this is also shown for the more general σ-finite measures with
`MeasureTheory.Measure.haveLebesgueDecomposition_of_sigmaFinite`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Lebesgue/Variant1f97b4c782c7ca656e86a5bdbccdf4081356eb5487aca56bb2144f2eb8215b62.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Lebesgue/Variant1f97b4c782c7ca656e86a5bdbccdf4081356eb5487aca56bb2144f2eb8215b62.lean#L840).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `883724233c3fd89322f8347adcc92d1cab190c27` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
