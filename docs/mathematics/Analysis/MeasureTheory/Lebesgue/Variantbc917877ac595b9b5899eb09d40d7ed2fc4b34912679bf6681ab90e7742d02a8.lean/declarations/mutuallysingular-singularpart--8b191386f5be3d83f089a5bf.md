## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:586b2475-e192-597f-bee2-b7fba09f64e7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 142–155.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
nonrec theorem mutuallySingular_singularPart (s : SignedMeasure α) (μ : Measure α) :
    singularPart s μ ⟂ᵥ μ.toENNRealVectorMeasure := by
  rw [mutuallySingular_ennreal_iff, singularPart_totalVariation,
    VectorMeasure.ennrealToMeasure_toENNRealVectorMeasure]
  exact (mutuallySingular_singularPart _ _).add_left (mutuallySingular_singularPart _ _)

end

/-- The Radon-Nikodym derivative between a signed measure and a positive measure.

`rnDeriv s μ` satisfies `μ.withDensityᵥ (s.rnDeriv μ) = s`
if and only if `s` is absolutely continuous with respect to `μ` and this fact is known as
`MeasureTheory.SignedMeasure.absolutelyContinuous_iff_withDensity_rnDeriv_eq`
and can be found in `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Measure/Decomposition/RadonNikodym.lean`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Lebesgue/Variantbc917877ac595b9b5899eb09d40d7ed2fc4b34912679bf6681ab90e7742d02a8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Lebesgue/Variantbc917877ac595b9b5899eb09d40d7ed2fc4b34912679bf6681ab90e7742d02a8.lean#L142).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `be8598a7f6d8ddce356a6e9b6960c247e1b4768d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
