## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a4f03b904297f4c7a2a5a5c86a9f93b4f5fffebd6c8c2d5bac3aa9da15d03a69`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 140–145.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance HaveLebesgueDecomposition.sum_left {ι : Type*} [Countable ι] (μ : ι → Measure α)
    [∀ i, HaveLebesgueDecomposition (μ i) ν] : HaveLebesgueDecomposition (.sum μ) ν :=
  ⟨(.sum fun i ↦ (μ i).singularPart ν, ∑' i, rnDeriv (μ i) ν),
    by dsimp only; fun_prop, by simp [mutuallySingular_singularPart], by
      simp [withDensity_tsum, measurable_rnDeriv, Measure.sum_add_sum, singularPart_add_rnDeriv]⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Lebesgue/Variant6cad60d7fd897bb2d80154dfdcbaf78ad8e919d78109197bece34929aa96a97c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Lebesgue/Variant6cad60d7fd897bb2d80154dfdcbaf78ad8e919d78109197bece34929aa96a97c.lean#L140).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dc274a51e60f728ba7894b9ee7a3f16a07b8ec1e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
