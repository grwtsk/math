## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f588b9d4-f6ab-6209-3cfa-2991e660463b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 27–34.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ae_restrict_le_codiscreteWithin
    {α : Type*} [MeasurableSpace α] [TopologicalSpace α] [SecondCountableTopology α]
    {μ : Measure α} [NoAtoms μ] {U : Set α} (hU : MeasurableSet U) :
    ae (μ.restrict U) ≤ codiscreteWithin U := by
  intro s hs
  have := discreteTopology_of_codiscreteWithin hs
  rw [mem_ae_iff, Measure.restrict_apply' hU]
  apply Set.Countable.measure_zero (TopologicalSpace.separableSpace_iff_countable.1 inferInstance)
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Topology/Variante1883a0feeb21a12a1c0d02f5356ce20219469e8469c73fa8aaef6abacf46758.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Topology/Variante1883a0feeb21a12a1c0d02f5356ce20219469e8469c73fa8aaef6abacf46758.lean#L27).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f6d284297c878d48586c47554d716e47dd2f27b6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
