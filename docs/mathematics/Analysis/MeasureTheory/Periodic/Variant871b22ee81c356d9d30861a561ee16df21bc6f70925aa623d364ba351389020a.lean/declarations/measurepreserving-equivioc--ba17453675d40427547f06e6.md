## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:12f81c4e-3045-e323-e030-283b96bda6d1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 156–173.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma measurePreserving_equivIoc {a : ℝ} :
    MeasurePreserving (equivIoc T a) volume (Measure.comap Subtype.val volume) := by
  have h := (measurableEquivIoc T a).measurable
  refine ⟨h, ?_⟩
  ext s hs
  rw [comap_apply _ Subtype.val_injective (fun _ ↦ measurableSet_Ioc.subtype_image) _ hs,
    map_apply (by measurability) hs, add_projection_respects_measure T a (by exact h hs)]

    exists_eq_right]

  rw [equivIoc_coe_eq hx]

attribute [local instance] Subtype.measureSpace in
/-- The lower integral of a function over `AddCircle T` is equal to the lower integral over an
interval $(t, t + T]$ in `ℝ` of its lift to `ℝ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Periodic/Variant871b22ee81c356d9d30861a561ee16df21bc6f70925aa623d364ba351389020a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Periodic/Variant871b22ee81c356d9d30861a561ee16df21bc6f70925aa623d364ba351389020a.lean#L156).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fe18168521a13fd0cab569f0cf1212a594b1bf14` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
