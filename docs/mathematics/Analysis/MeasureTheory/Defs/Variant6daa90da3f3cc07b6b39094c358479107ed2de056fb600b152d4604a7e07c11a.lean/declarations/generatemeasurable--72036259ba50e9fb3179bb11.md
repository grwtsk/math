## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `inductive` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:aa29ddd178111b60a10f2b2c75757d5bf60810f7f6f0d07f0ba8fca1e14459ad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 329–337.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
inductive GenerateMeasurable (s : Set (Set α)) : Set α → Prop
  | protected basic : ∀ u ∈ s, GenerateMeasurable s u
  | protected empty : GenerateMeasurable s ∅
  | protected compl : ∀ t, GenerateMeasurable s t → GenerateMeasurable s tᶜ
  | protected iUnion : ∀ f : ℕ → Set α, (∀ n, GenerateMeasurable s (f n)) →
      GenerateMeasurable s (⋃ i, f i)

/-- Construct the smallest measure space containing a collection of basic sets -/
@[instance_reducible]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Defs/Variant6daa90da3f3cc07b6b39094c358479107ed2de056fb600b152d4604a7e07c11a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Defs/Variant6daa90da3f3cc07b6b39094c358479107ed2de056fb600b152d4604a7e07c11a.lean#L329).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `50408e0e4141f9e009bd97033c9564769922cc1d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
