## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6a33d0c763dc5503deaffcfd67c2fa1bf794c212c8b1752c3b56a52cbf12b817`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 929–945.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
private noncomputable def LpToLpOfMeasureLeSMulₗ (hc : c ≠ ∞) (h : μ ≤ c • ν) :
    Lp E p ν →ₗ[ℝ] Lp E p μ where
  toFun f := ((Lp.memLp f).of_measure_le_smul hc h).toLp f
  map_add' f g := by
    ext
    grw [MemLp.coeFn_toLp, Lp.coeFn_add, MemLp.coeFn_toLp, MemLp.coeFn_toLp]
    have : μ ≪ ν := Measure.absolutelyContinuous_of_le_smul h
    apply this.ae_eq
    grw [Lp.coeFn_add]
  map_smul' c f := by
    ext
    grw [MemLp.coeFn_toLp, Lp.coeFn_smul, MemLp.coeFn_toLp]
    have : μ ≪ ν := Measure.absolutelyContinuous_of_le_smul h
    apply this.ae_eq
    grw [Lp.coeFn_smul]
    rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantb14cca8c1c20b98feda4bb99e3e44e619b9dcd28f25cf658b7215cfbd0fcc511.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantb14cca8c1c20b98feda4bb99e3e44e619b9dcd28f25cf658b7215cfbd0fcc511.lean#L929).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e1f0f7c4a292a1673c78326b4b09a8e389d55ab0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
