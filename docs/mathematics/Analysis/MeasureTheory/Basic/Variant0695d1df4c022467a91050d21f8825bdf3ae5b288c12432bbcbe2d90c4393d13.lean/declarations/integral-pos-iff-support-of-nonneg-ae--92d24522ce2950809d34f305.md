## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6510f539-5b38-d2a3-b33c-785aef567054`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1313–1327.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integral_pos_iff_support_of_nonneg_ae' (hf : 0 ≤ᵐ[μ.restrict (Ι a b)] f)
    (hfi : IntervalIntegrable f μ a b) :
    (0 < ∫ x in a..b, f x ∂μ) ↔ a < b ∧ 0 < μ (support f ∩ Ioc a b) := by
  rcases lt_or_ge a b with hab | hba
  · rw [uIoc_of_le hab.le] at hf
    simp only [hab, true_and, integral_of_le hab.le,
      setIntegral_pos_iff_support_of_nonneg_ae hf hfi.1]
  · suffices (∫ x in a..b, f x ∂μ) ≤ 0 by simp only [this.not_gt, hba.not_gt, false_and]
    rw [integral_of_ge hba, neg_nonpos]
    rw [uIoc_comm, uIoc_of_le hba] at hf
    exact integral_nonneg_of_ae hf

/-- If `f` is nonnegative a.e.-everywhere and it is integrable on the unordered interval
`Set.uIoc a b`, then its integral over `a..b` is positive if and only if `a < b` and the
measure of `Function.support f ∩ Set.Ioc a b` is positive. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant0695d1df4c022467a91050d21f8825bdf3ae5b288c12432bbcbe2d90c4393d13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant0695d1df4c022467a91050d21f8825bdf3ae5b288c12432bbcbe2d90c4393d13.lean#L1313).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e4f728d6af658326b073506faee0f72ff0c7494` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
