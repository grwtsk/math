## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e77437e7-34f6-2311-c58f-92fee69bcc84`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 582–594.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem intervalIntegrable_of_even
    (h₁f : ∀ x, f x = f (-x)) (h₂f : ∀ x, 0 < x → IntervalIntegrable f volume 0 x) {a b : ℝ}
    (ha : ‖f (min 0 a)‖ₑ ≠ ∞ := by finiteness) (hb : ‖f (min 0 b)‖ₑ ≠ ∞ := by finiteness) :
    IntervalIntegrable f volume a b :=
  -- Split integral and apply lemma
  (intervalIntegrable_of_even₀ h₁f h₂f ha).symm.trans (b := 0)
    (intervalIntegrable_of_even₀ h₁f h₂f hb)

/-- An odd function is interval integrable (with respect to the volume measure) on every interval
of the form `0..x` if it is interval integrable (with respect to the volume measure) on every
interval of the form `0..x`, for positive `x`.

See `intervalIntegrable_of_odd` for a stronger result. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant0695d1df4c022467a91050d21f8825bdf3ae5b288c12432bbcbe2d90c4393d13.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant0695d1df4c022467a91050d21f8825bdf3ae5b288c12432bbcbe2d90c4393d13.lean#L582).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5e4f728d6af658326b073506faee0f72ff0c7494` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
