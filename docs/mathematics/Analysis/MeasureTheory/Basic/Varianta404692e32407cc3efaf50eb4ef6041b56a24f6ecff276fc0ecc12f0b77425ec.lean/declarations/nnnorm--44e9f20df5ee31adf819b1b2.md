## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3590153d-a5ee-e9ca-d98a-f82894a1931d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 882–891.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem nnnorm {_ : MeasurableSpace α} {β : Type*} [SeminormedAddCommGroup β] {f : α → β}
    (hf : StronglyMeasurable f) : StronglyMeasurable fun x => ‖f x‖₊ :=
  continuous_nnnorm.comp_stronglyMeasurable hf

/-- The `enorm` of a strongly measurable function is measurable.

Unlike `StrongMeasurable.norm` and `StronglyMeasurable.nnnorm`, this lemma proves measurability,
**not** strong measurability. This is an intentional decision: for functions taking values in
ℝ≥0∞, measurability is much more useful than strong measurability. -/
@[fun_prop, measurability]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Varianta404692e32407cc3efaf50eb4ef6041b56a24f6ecff276fc0ecc12f0b77425ec.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Varianta404692e32407cc3efaf50eb4ef6041b56a24f6ecff276fc0ecc12f0b77425ec.lean#L882).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `387265fdfa927150926529b5ea6818f96cb354e9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
