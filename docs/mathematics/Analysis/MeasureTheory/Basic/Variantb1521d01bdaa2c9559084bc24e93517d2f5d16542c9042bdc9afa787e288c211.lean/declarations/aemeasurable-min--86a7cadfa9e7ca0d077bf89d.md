## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:59d81bf5-2b34-3f2f-9af0-810d1156c52d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 880–889.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
nonrec theorem AEMeasurable.min {f g : δ → α} {μ : Measure δ} (hf : AEMeasurable f μ)
    (hg : AEMeasurable g μ) : AEMeasurable (fun a => min (f a) (g a)) μ :=
  ⟨fun a => min (hf.mk f a) (hg.mk g a), hf.measurable_mk.min hg.measurable_mk,
    EventuallyEq.comp₂ hf.ae_eq_mk _ hg.ae_eq_mk⟩
#align ae_measurable.min AEMeasurable.min

end LinearOrder

/-- A continuous function from an `OpensMeasurableSpace` to a `BorelSpace`
is measurable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantb1521d01bdaa2c9559084bc24e93517d2f5d16542c9042bdc9afa787e288c211.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantb1521d01bdaa2c9559084bc24e93517d2f5d16542c9042bdc9afa787e288c211.lean#L880).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2095417a1394f77dd8b7a70a5fdc925d93c9fcd8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
