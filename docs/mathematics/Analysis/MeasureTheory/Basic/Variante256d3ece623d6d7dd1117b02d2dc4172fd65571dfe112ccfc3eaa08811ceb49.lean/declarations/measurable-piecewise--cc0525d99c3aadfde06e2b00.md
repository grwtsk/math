## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7b8eab10-0854-9f3e-363d-3389e454d074`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 287–296.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem Measurable.piecewise {_ : DecidablePred (· ∈ s)} (hs : MeasurableSet s)
    (hf : Measurable f) (hg : Measurable g) : Measurable (piecewise s f g) := by
  intro t ht
  rw [piecewise_preimage]
  exact hs.ite (hf ht) (hg ht)

/-- This is slightly different from `Measurable.piecewise`. It can be used to show
`Measurable (ite (x=0) 0 1)` by
`exact Measurable.ite (measurableSet_singleton 0) measurable_const measurable_const`,
but replacing `Measurable.ite` by `Measurable.piecewise` in that example proof does not work. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variante256d3ece623d6d7dd1117b02d2dc4172fd65571dfe112ccfc3eaa08811ceb49.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variante256d3ece623d6d7dd1117b02d2dc4172fd65571dfe112ccfc3eaa08811ceb49.lean#L287).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bbc3af1d59ad3a1431afa37d724631a4132f16ea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
