## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c1154cc54ffa2a94562f8a4d705d4eab5a9e24592bec1cac3a77fcb86cb163fd`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 394–411.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance instNormedAddCommGroup [hp : Fact (1 ≤ p)] : NormedAddCommGroup (Lp E p μ) :=
  { AddGroupNorm.toNormedAddCommGroup
      { toFun := (norm : Lp E p μ → ℝ)
        map_zero' := norm_zero
        neg' := by simp only [norm_neg, implies_true] -- squeezed for performance reasons
        add_le' := fun f g => by
          suffices ‖f + g‖ₑ ≤ ‖f‖ₑ + ‖g‖ₑ by
            -- Squeezed for performance reasons
            simpa only [ge_iff_le, enorm, ←ENNReal.coe_add, ENNReal.coe_le_coe] using this
          simp only [Lp.enorm_def]
          exact (eLpNorm_congr_ae (AEEqFun.coeFn_add _ _)).trans_le
            (eLpNorm_add_le (Lp.aestronglyMeasurable _) (Lp.aestronglyMeasurable _) hp.out)
        eq_zero_of_map_eq_zero' := fun _ =>
          (norm_eq_zero_iff <| zero_lt_one.trans_le hp.1).1 } with
    edist := edist
    edist_dist := Lp.edist_dist }

-- check no diamond is created
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantd940992e27d2bb30fff00ff4f58b47bcf3bf2714682bc712d49867af6a4c8c27.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantd940992e27d2bb30fff00ff4f58b47bcf3bf2714682bc712d49867af6a4c8c27.lean#L394).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f46409fee18d9ab42311db2c97b83043cdb18d3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
