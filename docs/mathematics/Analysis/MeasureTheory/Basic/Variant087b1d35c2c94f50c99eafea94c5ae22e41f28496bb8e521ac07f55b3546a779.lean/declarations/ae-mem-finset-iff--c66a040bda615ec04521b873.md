## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:24de94e8-c5a2-223e-97a5-5b05dc97ca1f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 310–324.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma ae_mem_finset_iff : (∀ᵐ a ∂μ, a ∈ s) ↔ μ = ∑ a ∈ s, μ {a} • .dirac a where
  mp hμ := by
    ext t ht

    dsimp
    rw [Set.sdiff_compl, ← (s : Set α).biUnion_of_singleton]

    rw [measure_biUnion_finset (fun i hi j hj hij ↦ .inter_left' _ <| .inter_right' _ ?_)
      (by measurability)]

  mpr hμ := by rw [hμ, ae_finsetSum_measure_iff]; exact fun i hi ↦ ae_smul_measure (by simpa) _

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant087b1d35c2c94f50c99eafea94c5ae22e41f28496bb8e521ac07f55b3546a779.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant087b1d35c2c94f50c99eafea94c5ae22e41f28496bb8e521ac07f55b3546a779.lean#L310).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a714226af6c6e77fab6ce61b204e2c489f107d6f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
