## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a7e0ce37-8e15-360f-8334-366d869a37f0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 479–495.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Filter.Tendsto.eventually_intervalIntegrable_ae {f : ℝ → E} {μ : Measure ℝ}
    {l l' : Filter ℝ} (hfm : StronglyMeasurableAtFilter f l' μ) [TendstoIxxClass Ioc l l']
    [IsMeasurablyGenerated l'] (hμ : μ.FiniteAtFilter l') {c : E} (hf : Tendsto f (l' ⊓ ae μ) (𝓝 c))
    {u v : ι → ℝ} {lt : Filter ι} (hu : Tendsto u lt l) (hv : Tendsto v lt l) :
    ∀ᶠ t in lt, IntervalIntegrable f μ (u t) (v t) :=
  have := (hf.integrableAtFilter_ae hfm hμ).eventually
  ((hu.Ioc hv).eventually this).and <| (hv.Ioc hu).eventually this

/-- Let `l'` be a measurably generated filter; let `l` be a of filter such that each `s ∈ l'`
eventually includes `Ioc u v` as both `u` and `v` tend to `l`. Let `μ` be a measure finite at `l'`.

Suppose that `f : ℝ → E` has a finite limit at `l`. Then `f` is interval integrable on `u..v`
provided that both `u` and `v` tend to `l`.

Typeclass instances allow Lean to find `l'` based on `l` but not vice versa, so
`apply Tendsto.eventually_intervalIntegrable` will generate goals `Filter ℝ` and
`TendstoIxxClass Ioc ?m_1 l'`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantc67e9a159fb6b0f3808ff1ce0b3447a6d1783b211502d6662154b196dcc937cd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantc67e9a159fb6b0f3808ff1ce0b3447a6d1783b211502d6662154b196dcc937cd.lean#L479).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `160793feb553315fd52e83dfb3607576ea7abd4a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
