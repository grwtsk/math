## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:16483bf6-c67b-65fd-bbdc-35494ad5c119`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 640–647.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pi_le_borel_pi {ι : Type*} {X : ι → Type*} [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (X i)]
    [∀ i, MeasurableSpace (X i)] [∀ i, BorelSpace (X i)] :
      MeasurableSpace.pi ≤ borel (∀ i, X i) := by
  have : ‹∀ i, MeasurableSpace (X i)› = fun i => borel (X i) :=
    funext fun i => BorelSpace.measurable_eq
  rw [this]
  exact iSup_le fun i => comap_le_iff_le_map.2 <| (continuous_apply i).borel_measurable

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Varianta37773fcbbda181eb77fc05ec2182cd594bad3ac9adff522f2fe0c5862412eed.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Varianta37773fcbbda181eb77fc05ec2182cd594bad3ac9adff522f2fe0c5862412eed.lean#L640).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2e84b41471f757f1a130e0cb9887c77901ab936c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
