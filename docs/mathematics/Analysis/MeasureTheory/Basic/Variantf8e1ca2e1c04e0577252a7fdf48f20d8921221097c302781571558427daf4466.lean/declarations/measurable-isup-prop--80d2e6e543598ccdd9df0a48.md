## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1823ca43-481f-daac-45e5-308201d31e29`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1309–1315.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Measurable.iSup_Prop {α} [MeasurableSpace α] [CompleteLattice α] (p : Prop) {f : δ → α}
    (hf : Measurable f) : Measurable fun b => ⨆ _ : p, f b :=
  _root_.by_cases (fun h : p => by convert hf; funext; exact iSup_pos h) fun h : ¬p => by
    convert measurable_const using 1; funext; exact iSup_neg h
#align measurable.supr_Prop Measurable.iSup_Prop

@[measurability]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantf8e1ca2e1c04e0577252a7fdf48f20d8921221097c302781571558427daf4466.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantf8e1ca2e1c04e0577252a7fdf48f20d8921221097c302781571558427daf4466.lean#L1309).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bf7761044a2eca410d520e2d468bbdb6aa480c7d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
