## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:519d6b00-d19a-0fac-8f94-bb24f8f44f22`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 607–615.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measurable_comp_iff_restrict {f : X → Z}
    [CountablySeparated (range f)]
    (hf : Measurable f) {g : Z → β} : Measurable (g ∘ f) ↔ Measurable (domRestrict (range f) g) :=
  forall₂_congr fun s _ => measurableSet_preimage_iff_preimage_val hf (s := g ⁻¹' s)

/-- If `f : X → Z` is a surjective Borel measurable map from a standard Borel space
to a countably separated measurable space,
then for any measurable space `α` and `g : Z → α`, the composition
`g ∘ f` is measurable if and only if `g` is measurable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Varianta0d3097223c0f4f192fb7a93b5e38bec40b64b5a0f48d148643a4865eb26acbb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Varianta0d3097223c0f4f192fb7a93b5e38bec40b64b5a0f48d148643a4865eb26acbb.lean#L607).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a992dd64a895591bbde7cc6456a1648546ef2862` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
