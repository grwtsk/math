## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1aaa4c4b-bd62-0517-6b62-5c42ceaf16fb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 349–365.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem volume_preimage_mul_right {a : ℝ} (h : a ≠ 0) (s : Set ℝ) :
    volume ((· * a) ⁻¹' s) = ENNReal.ofReal (abs a⁻¹) * volume s :=
  calc
    volume ((· * a) ⁻¹' s) = Measure.map (· * a) volume s :=
      ((Homeomorph.mulRight₀ a h).toMeasurableEquiv.map_apply s).symm
    _ = ENNReal.ofReal (abs a⁻¹) * volume s := by rw [map_volume_mul_right h]; rfl

open Matrix

/-- A diagonal matrix rescales Lebesgue according to its determinant. This is a special case of
`Real.map_matrix_volume_pi_eq_smul_volume_pi`, that one should use instead (and whose proof
uses this particular case). -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant6578c38da5a7f0dd1217b5a5b2e9d747c14f17ca442bf4d3e0fbfde5b6d41502.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant6578c38da5a7f0dd1217b5a5b2e9d747c14f17ca442bf4d3e0fbfde5b6d41502.lean#L349).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3b07f9e776b5119e22ac0ac9c3289c3c6eda1e5a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
