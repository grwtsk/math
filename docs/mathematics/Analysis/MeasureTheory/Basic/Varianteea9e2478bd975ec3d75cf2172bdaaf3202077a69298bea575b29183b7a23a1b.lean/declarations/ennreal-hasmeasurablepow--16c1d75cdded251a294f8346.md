## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bdd762c11f1b9bd25e79f2ba69410f5c65cbf77c4a2dc94aa0c2792d4231eaf4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 314–325.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance ENNReal.hasMeasurablePow : MeasurablePow ℝ≥0∞ ℝ := by
  refine ⟨ENNReal.measurable_of_measurable_nnreal_prod ?_ ?_⟩
  · simp_rw [ENNReal.coe_rpow_def]
    refine Measurable.ite ?_ measurable_const (measurable_fst.pow measurable_snd).coe_nnreal_ennreal
    exact
      MeasurableSet.inter (measurable_fst (measurableSet_singleton 0))
        (measurable_snd measurableSet_Iio)
  · simp_rw [ENNReal.top_rpow_def]
    refine Measurable.ite measurableSet_Ioi measurable_const ?_
    exact Measurable.ite (measurableSet_singleton 0) measurable_const measurable_const

end PowInstances
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Varianteea9e2478bd975ec3d75cf2172bdaaf3202077a69298bea575b29183b7a23a1b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Varianteea9e2478bd975ec3d75cf2172bdaaf3202077a69298bea575b29183b7a23a1b.lean#L314).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `86ac1d73633a78975538c4f7d95c605d78b664aa` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
