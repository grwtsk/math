## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a6d854f7-0933-d5dc-ca45-6dbae531590a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 653–680.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    {p : ℝ → Prop} (h : ∀ a b, a ∈ s → b ∈ s → a < b → ∀ᵐ x ∂μ, x ∈ s ∩ Ioo a b → p x) :
    ∀ᵐ x ∂μ, x ∈ s → p x := by
  /- By second-countability, we cover `s` by countably many intervals `(a, b)` (except maybe for
    two endpoints, which don't matter since `μ` does not have any atom). -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant628bcfc45fabd59501cdebf1cc3a8003ef3aba18fc7de4710ca9ffc1033b32d7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant628bcfc45fabd59501cdebf1cc3a8003ef3aba18fc7de4710ca9ffc1033b32d7.lean#L653).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `84794cf74fa34664073bbf336adccdefb5bada62` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
