## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:705a383e-7b05-547a-11f1-c3472aa2516c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 240–280.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (hs : ∀ n, AnalyticSet (s n)) : AnalyticSet (⋂ n, s n) := by
  rcases hι with ⟨i₀⟩
  /- For the proof, write each `s n` as the continuous image under a map `f n` of a
    Polish space `β n`. The product space `γ = Π n, β n` is also Polish, and so is the subset
    `t` of sequences `x n` for which `f n (x n)` is independent of `n`. The set `t` is Polish, and
    the range of `x ↦ f 0 (x 0)` on `t` is exactly `⋂ n, s n`, so this set is analytic. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant07e77ffadb3d07d2295b01439048f03b6f85f0e32719bee5ee82c7ec3250d47d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant07e77ffadb3d07d2295b01439048f03b6f85f0e32719bee5ee82c7ec3250d47d.lean#L240).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
