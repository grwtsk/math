## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:16a0bd86-c15d-9533-f151-e6701a09f0ef`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 313–326.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    [MeasurableSpace α] [BorelSpace α] {s : Set α} (hs : MeasurableSet s) : AnalyticSet s := by
  /- For a short proof (avoiding measurable induction), one sees `s` as a closed set for a finer
    topology `t'`. It is analytic for this topology. As the identity from `t'` to `t` is continuous
    and the image of an analytic set is analytic, it follows that `s` is also analytic for `t`. -/
  obtain ⟨t', t't, t'_polish, s_closed, _⟩ :
      ∃ t' : TopologicalSpace α, t' ≤ t ∧ @PolishSpace α t' ∧ IsClosed[t'] s ∧ IsOpen[t'] s :=

  have A := @IsClosed.analyticSet α t' t'_polish s s_closed

  simp only [id, image_id']

/-- Given a Borel-measurable function from a Polish space to a second-countable space, there exists
a finer Polish topology on the source space for which the function is continuous. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant07e77ffadb3d07d2295b01439048f03b6f85f0e32719bee5ee82c7ec3250d47d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant07e77ffadb3d07d2295b01439048f03b6f85f0e32719bee5ee82c7ec3250d47d.lean#L313).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `65a2dd60c6688280f43a9ce508bf249a3a052adc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
