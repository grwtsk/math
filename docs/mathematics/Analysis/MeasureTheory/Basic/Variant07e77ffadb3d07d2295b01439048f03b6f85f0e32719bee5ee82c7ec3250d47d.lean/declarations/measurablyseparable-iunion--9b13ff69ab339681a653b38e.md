## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a9227e21-d7a4-13bb-30c0-2ce5e1bf868c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 379–395.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem MeasurablySeparable.iUnion [Countable ι] {α : Type*} [MeasurableSpace α] {s t : ι → Set α}
    (h : ∀ m n, MeasurablySeparable (s m) (t n)) : MeasurablySeparable (⋃ n, s n) (⋃ m, t m) := by
  choose u hsu htu hu using h
  refine ⟨⋃ m, ⋂ n, u m n, ?_, ?_, ?_⟩

  · simp_rw [disjoint_iUnion_left, disjoint_iUnion_right]

    apply iInter_subset
  · refine MeasurableSet.iUnion fun m => ?_
    exact MeasurableSet.iInter fun n => hu m n

/-- The hard part of the Lusin separation theorem saying that two disjoint analytic sets are
contained in disjoint Borel sets (see the full statement in `AnalyticSet.measurablySeparable`).
Here, we prove this when our analytic sets are the ranges of functions from `ℕ → ℕ`.

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant07e77ffadb3d07d2295b01439048f03b6f85f0e32719bee5ee82c7ec3250d47d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant07e77ffadb3d07d2295b01439048f03b6f85f0e32719bee5ee82c7ec3250d47d.lean#L379).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `65a2dd60c6688280f43a9ce508bf249a3a052adc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
