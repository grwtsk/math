## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fed7d398-2bc4-e338-6ed5-447b8f2bfeeb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 362–369.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem prodMk {m : MeasurableSpace α} [TopologicalSpace β] [TopologicalSpace γ]
    {f : α → β} {g : α → γ} (hf : StronglyMeasurable f) (hg : StronglyMeasurable g) :
    StronglyMeasurable fun x => (f x, g x) := by
  refine ⟨fun n => SimpleFunc.pair (hf.approx n) (hg.approx n), fun x => ?_⟩
  rw [nhds_prod_eq]
  exact Tendsto.prodMk (hf.tendsto_approx x) (hg.tendsto_approx x)

@[fun_prop]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant28e9825b72ef3d72f615eb38bc387462e4cd89917b6c7447a4082a74bb466bb2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant28e9825b72ef3d72f615eb38bc387462e4cd89917b6c7447a4082a74bb466bb2.lean#L362).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d70e47d4c025a18eace67bec5f4b487bf6dc01ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
