## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f27ad385-35d0-b4ba-d42b-0f81bbef44d5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1052–1067.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem stronglyMeasurable_in_set {m : MeasurableSpace α} [TopologicalSpace β] [Zero β] {s : Set α}
    {f : α → β} (hs : MeasurableSet s) (hf : StronglyMeasurable f)
    (hf_zero : ∀ x, x ∉ s → f x = 0) :
    ∃ fs : ℕ → α →ₛ β,
      (∀ x, Tendsto (fun n => fs n x) atTop (𝓝 (f x))) ∧ ∀ x ∉ s, ∀ n, fs n x = 0 := by
  refine ⟨fun n => (hf.approx n).restrict s, ?_, ?_⟩
  · intro x
    by_cases hx : x ∈ s
    · simpa [SimpleFunc.coe_restrict, hs, hx] using hf.tendsto_approx x
    · simpa [SimpleFunc.coe_restrict, hs, hx, hf_zero x hx] using tendsto_const_nhds
  · intro x hx n
    simp [SimpleFunc.coe_restrict, hs, hx]

/-- If the restriction to a set `s` of a σ-algebra `m` is included in the restriction to `s` of
another σ-algebra `m₂` (hypothesis `hs`), the set `s` is `m` measurable and a function `f` supported
on `s` is `m`-strongly-measurable, then `f` is also `m₂`-strongly-measurable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant28e9825b72ef3d72f615eb38bc387462e4cd89917b6c7447a4082a74bb466bb2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variant28e9825b72ef3d72f615eb38bc387462e4cd89917b6c7447a4082a74bb466bb2.lean#L1052).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d70e47d4c025a18eace67bec5f4b487bf6dc01ba` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
