## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3d681008-8a94-2f33-da91-37bc5cd5574d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 780–786.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lintegral_prod_symm' [SigmaFinite μ] (f : α × β → ℝ≥0∞) (hf : Measurable f) :
    ∫⁻ z, f z ∂μ.prod ν = ∫⁻ y, ∫⁻ x, f (x, y) ∂μ ∂ν :=
  lintegral_prod_symm f hf.aemeasurable
#align measure_theory.lintegral_prod_symm' MeasureTheory.lintegral_prod_symm'

/-- The reversed version of **Tonelli's Theorem**. In this version `f` is in curried form, which
makes it easier for the elaborator to figure out `f` automatically. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantc65e55c405d103403b276211fe7c4b49a2cfe84320c4969f55ea7ca6c4920de9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantc65e55c405d103403b276211fe7c4b49a2cfe84320c4969f55ea7ca6c4920de9.lean#L780).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c2531ac0ab1b69ddc59f9602824950bb600e6e5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
