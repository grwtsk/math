## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:53392a1e-cd0e-eddb-d39f-29a61e1b34fa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 421–428.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ae_measure_lt_top {s : Set (α × β)} (hs : MeasurableSet s) (h2s : (μ.prod ν) s ≠ ∞) :
    ∀ᵐ x ∂μ, ν (Prod.mk x ⁻¹' s) < ∞ := by
  rw [prod_apply hs] at h2s
  refine' ae_lt_top (measurable_measure_prod_mk_left hs) h2s
#align measure_theory.measure.ae_measure_lt_top MeasureTheory.Measure.ae_measure_lt_top

/-- Note: the assumption `hs` cannot be dropped. For a counterexample, see
  Walter Rudin *Real and Complex Analysis*, example (c) in section 8.9. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantc65e55c405d103403b276211fe7c4b49a2cfe84320c4969f55ea7ca6c4920de9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantc65e55c405d103403b276211fe7c4b49a2cfe84320c4969f55ea7ca6c4920de9.lean#L421).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7c2531ac0ab1b69ddc59f9602824950bb600e6e5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
