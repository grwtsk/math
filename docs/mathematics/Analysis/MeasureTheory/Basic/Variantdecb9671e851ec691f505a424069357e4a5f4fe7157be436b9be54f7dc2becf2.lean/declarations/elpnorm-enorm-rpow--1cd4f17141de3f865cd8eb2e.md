## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a21e9f56-45cd-67c7-0000-8bf6c16342ad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 504–510.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eLpNorm'_enorm_rpow (f : α → ε') (p q : ℝ) (hq_pos : 0 < q) :
    eLpNorm' (‖f ·‖ₑ ^ q) p μ = eLpNorm' f (p * q) μ ^ q := by
  simp_rw [eLpNorm', ← ENNReal.rpow_mul, ← one_div_mul_one_div, one_div,
    mul_assoc, inv_mul_cancel₀ hq_pos.ne.symm, mul_one, enorm_eq_self, ← ENNReal.rpow_mul, mul_comm]

/-- `f : α → ℝ` and `ENNReal.ofReal ∘ f : α → ℝ≥0∞` have the same `eLpNorm`.
Usually, you should not use this lemma (but use enorms everywhere.) -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantdecb9671e851ec691f505a424069357e4a5f4fe7157be436b9be54f7dc2becf2.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Basic/Variantdecb9671e851ec691f505a424069357e4a5f4fe7157be436b9be54f7dc2becf2.lean#L504).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8fcf4a49f25efe1ab9f50139de711ac97c531135` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
