## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:02975bd1-85cb-122e-bc6b-c3af6a8086a0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 69–79.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem prop_of_mem_aeSeqSet (hf : ∀ i, AEMeasurable (f i) μ) {x : α} (hx : x ∈ aeSeqSet hf p) :
    p x fun n => aeSeq hf p n x := by
  simp only [aeSeq, hx, if_true]
  rw [funext fun n => mk_eq_fun_of_mem_aeSeqSet hf hx n]
  have h_ss : aeSeqSet hf p ⊆ { x | p x fun n => f n x } := by
    rw [← compl_compl { x | p x fun n => f n x }, aeSeqSet, Set.compl_subset_compl]
    refine Set.Subset.trans (Set.compl_subset_compl.mpr ?_) (subset_toMeasurable _ _)
    exact fun x hx => hx.2
  have hx' := Set.mem_of_subset_of_mem h_ss hx
  exact hx'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurableSequence/Variant88a78390350202a93e9a359ee29dff34f48f8eaebefe90030858d00a54be5b3a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurableSequence/Variant88a78390350202a93e9a359ee29dff34f48f8eaebefe90030858d00a54be5b3a.lean#L69).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2ce1fc795a86c2679f5f09e0941818235352034f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
