## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:92b068ff-2bb8-1f3b-6f80-3a1fc8775bb0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1288–1318.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem restrict_sInf_eq_sInf_restrict (m : Set (OuterMeasure α)) {s : Set α} (hm : m.Nonempty) :
    restrict s (sInf m) = sInf (restrict s '' m) := by
  simp only [sInf_eq_iInf, restrict_biInf, hm, iInf_image]
#align measure_theory.outer_measure.restrict_Inf_eq_Inf_restrict MeasureTheory.OuterMeasure.restrict_sInf_eq_sInf_restrict

end sInfGen

end OuterMeasure

/-! ### Induced Outer Measure

  We can extend a function defined on a subset of `Set α` to an outer measure.
  The underlying function is called `extend`, and the measure it induces is called
  `inducedOuterMeasure`.

  Some lemmas below are proven twice, once in the general case, and one where the function `m`
  is only defined on measurable sets (i.e. when `P = MeasurableSet`). In the latter cases, we can
  remove some hypotheses in the statement. The general version has the same name, but with a prime
  at the end. -/


section Extend

variable {α : Type*} {P : α → Prop}

variable (m : ∀ s : α, P s → ℝ≥0∞)

/-- We can trivially extend a function defined on a subclass of objects (with codomain `ℝ≥0∞`)
  to all objects by defining it to be `∞` on the objects not in the class. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/OuterMeasure/Variant7302b61f1fe357071ecffbca4b01938c4158dbbb384ee488d34b19c4659ae4af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/OuterMeasure/Variant7302b61f1fe357071ecffbca4b01938c4158dbbb384ee488d34b19c4659ae4af.lean#L1288).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6ff67b37e84e9f2cb08fd440bd19b779c9beb679` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
