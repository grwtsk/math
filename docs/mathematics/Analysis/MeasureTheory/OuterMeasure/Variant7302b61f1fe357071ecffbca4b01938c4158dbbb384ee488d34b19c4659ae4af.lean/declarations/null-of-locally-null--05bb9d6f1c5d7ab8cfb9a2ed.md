## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f85fd9c2-423f-6740-d9d3-82dd16d91707`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–173.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem null_of_locally_null [TopologicalSpace α] [SecondCountableTopology α] (m : OuterMeasure α)
    (s : Set α) (hs : ∀ x ∈ s, ∃ u ∈ 𝓝[s] x, m u = 0) : m s = 0 := by
  choose! u hxu hu₀ using hs
  choose t ht using TopologicalSpace.countable_cover_nhdsWithin hxu
  rcases ht with ⟨ts, t_count, ht⟩

#align measure_theory.outer_measure.null_of_locally_null MeasureTheory.OuterMeasure.null_of_locally_null

/-- If `m s ≠ 0`, then for some point `x ∈ s` and any `t ∈ 𝓝[s] x` we have `0 < m t`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/OuterMeasure/Variant7302b61f1fe357071ecffbca4b01938c4158dbbb384ee488d34b19c4659ae4af.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/OuterMeasure/Variant7302b61f1fe357071ecffbca4b01938c4158dbbb384ee488d34b19c4659ae4af.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6ff67b37e84e9f2cb08fd440bd19b779c9beb679` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
