## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:353d5c1e-f20b-11d7-b4fe-e6b5b3d379f5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 101–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_notConvergentSeq_lt (hε : 0 < ε)
    (hf : ∀ n, Measurable (fun a ↦ edist (f n a) (g a)))
    (hsm : MeasurableSet s) (hs : μ s ≠ ∞)
    (hfg : ∀ᵐ x ∂μ, x ∈ s → Tendsto (fun n => f n x) atTop (𝓝 (g x))) (n : ℕ) :
    ∃ j : ι, μ (s ∩ notConvergentSeq f g n j) ≤ ε * 2⁻¹ ^ n := by
  have ⟨N, hN⟩ := (ENNReal.tendsto_atTop zero_ne_top).1
    (measure_notConvergentSeq_tendsto_zero hf hsm hs hfg n) (ε * 2⁻¹ ^ n) (mul_pos hε.ne' (by simp))
  rw [zero_add] at hN
  exact ⟨N, (hN N le_rfl).2⟩

/-- Given some `ε > 0`, `notConvergentSeqLTIndex` provides the index such that
`notConvergentSeq` (intersected with a set of finite measure) has measure less than
`ε * 2⁻¹ ^ n`.

This definition is useful for Egorov's theorem. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Egorov/Variant8ab1ceb39cdceae4e7d5b942b05f4be7d3f1f4c26fb171820644fa18b6480867.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Egorov/Variant8ab1ceb39cdceae4e7d5b942b05f4be7d3f1f4c26fb171820644fa18b6480867.lean#L101).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `ce91ab5496e5e4d3e3db582666c8cd7575d7ff20` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
