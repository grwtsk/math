## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ae9daaf5-9414-d11c-28d7-9619cef72e10`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 852–859.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Continuous.integrableAt_nhds [TopologicalSpace α] [SecondCountableTopologyEither α E]
    [OpensMeasurableSpace α] {μ : Measure α} [IsLocallyFiniteMeasure μ] {f : α → E}
    (hf : Continuous f) (a : α) : IntegrableAtFilter f (𝓝 a) μ := by
  rw [← nhdsWithin_univ]
  exact hf.continuousOn.integrableAt_nhdsWithin MeasurableSet.univ (mem_univ a)

/-- If a function is continuous on an open set `s`, then it is strongly measurable at the filter
`𝓝 x` for all `x ∈ s` if either the source space or the target space is second-countable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/IntegrableOn/Variant38172379f0761cf4c027c78b9a0d6981a69678fcc652eddc6fca7d4039910cd3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/IntegrableOn/Variant38172379f0761cf4c027c78b9a0d6981a69678fcc652eddc6fca7d4039910cd3.lean#L852).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `798451013ebbcf882d5920f9b95d2fbbcd760f7f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
