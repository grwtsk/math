## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7d9ea54b-5505-3412-f11a-a294793acb73`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 497–514.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integrable_add_of_disjoint {f g : α → E} (h : Disjoint (support f) (support g))
    (hf : StronglyMeasurable f) (hg : StronglyMeasurable g) :
    Integrable (f + g) μ ↔ Integrable f μ ∧ Integrable g μ := by
  refine' ⟨fun hfg => ⟨_, _⟩, fun h => h.1.add h.2⟩
  · rw [← indicator_add_eq_left h]; exact hfg.indicator hf.measurableSet_support
  · rw [← indicator_add_eq_right h]; exact hfg.indicator hg.measurableSet_support
#align measure_theory.integrable_add_of_disjoint MeasureTheory.integrable_add_of_disjoint

variable [NormedAddCommGroup E]

/-- A function which is continuous on a set `s` is almost everywhere measurable with respect to
`μ.restrict s`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/IntegrableOn/Variant4c9f2582578ae50704e9eceeaceac2d33d776f3ad7ff3e1c65b450c0b6854e97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/IntegrableOn/Variant4c9f2582578ae50704e9eceeaceac2d33d776f3ad7ff3e1c65b450c0b6854e97.lean#L497).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `9b000638b28d1dbc542c5e2e53ca7b509e5bb560` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
