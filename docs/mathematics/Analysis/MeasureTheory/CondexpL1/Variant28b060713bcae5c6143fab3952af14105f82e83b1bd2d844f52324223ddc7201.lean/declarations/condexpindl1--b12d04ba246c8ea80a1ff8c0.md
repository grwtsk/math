## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:1c08673f5ea16547ca48848fca4f12611cfb3f88f0fde411e505f9cfc0c44b5d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 152–157.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def condExpIndL1 {m m0 : MeasurableSpace α} (hm : m ≤ m0) (μ : Measure α) (s : Set α)
    [SigmaFinite (μ.trim hm)] (x : G) : α →₁[μ] G :=
  if hs : MeasurableSet s ∧ μ s ≠ ∞ then condExpIndL1Fin hm hs.1 hs.2 x else 0

variable {hm : m ≤ m0} [SigmaFinite (μ.trim hm)]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CondexpL1/Variant28b060713bcae5c6143fab3952af14105f82e83b1bd2d844f52324223ddc7201.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CondexpL1/Variant28b060713bcae5c6143fab3952af14105f82e83b1bd2d844f52324223ddc7201.lean#L152).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `da7bcf32a2f3298ad53b79d3a81ebddd9fe25d13` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
