## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:59f0f40d57b64192d6dc367fed83f087c260acf4d08070b4f363f1b28eec4baa`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 141–150.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def MutuallySingular (v : VectorMeasure α M) (w : VectorMeasure α N) : Prop :=
  ∃ s : Set α, MeasurableSet s ∧ (∀ t ⊆ s, v t = 0) ∧ ∀ t ⊆ sᶜ, w t = 0

@[inherit_doc VectorMeasure.MutuallySingular]
scoped[MeasureTheory] infixl:60 " ⟂ᵥ " => MeasureTheory.VectorMeasure.MutuallySingular

namespace MutuallySingular

variable {v v₁ v₂ : VectorMeasure α M} {w w₁ w₂ : VectorMeasure α N}

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Relations/Variant5168bffa6cfda3c4fbb8fff4765ad8c2be1570e9a7df61714f9f6b33fb519f78.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Relations/Variant5168bffa6cfda3c4fbb8fff4765ad8c2be1570e9a7df61714f9f6b33fb519f78.lean#L141).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `53ec47576c6bfaa857aa3e0a0f2d1e8a543098d9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
