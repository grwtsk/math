## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:59e522e48fcda7c7dc6ca0e3410d613c635a7ea91f4ad183819d1fd7c665ea13`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 542–555.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure DynkinSystem (α : Type*) where
  /-- Predicate saying that a given set is contained in the Dynkin system. -/
  Has : Set α → Prop
  /-- A Dynkin system contains the empty set. -/
  has_empty : Has ∅
  /-- A Dynkin system is closed under complementation. -/
  has_compl : ∀ {a}, Has a → Has aᶜ
  /-- A Dynkin system is closed under countable union of pairwise disjoint sets. Use a more general
  `MeasurableSpace.DynkinSystem.has_iUnion` instead. -/
  has_iUnion_nat : ∀ {f : ℕ → Set α}, Pairwise (Disjoint on f) → (∀ i, Has (f i)) → Has (⋃ i, f i)

namespace DynkinSystem

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/PiSystem/Varianta29f9d43c59df6ee8ed2a1390141188b1ebd2352292b318a511eb531655a3428.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/PiSystem/Varianta29f9d43c59df6ee8ed2a1390141188b1ebd2352292b318a511eb531655a3428.lean#L542).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `884137e2e65b412a594237275890f04d4f73cbea` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
