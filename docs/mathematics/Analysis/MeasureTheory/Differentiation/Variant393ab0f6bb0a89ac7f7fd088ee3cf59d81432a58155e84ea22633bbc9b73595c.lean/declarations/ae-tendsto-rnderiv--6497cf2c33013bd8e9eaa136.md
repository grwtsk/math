## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f0fd61cc-c710-a570-b828-a3bf662fcbda`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 690–713.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! ### Lebesgue density points -/


/-- Given a measurable set `s`, then `μ (s ∩ a) / μ a` converges when `a` shrinks to a typical
point `x` along a Vitali family. The limit is `1` for `x ∈ s` and `0` for `x ∉ s`. This shows that
almost every point of `s` is a Lebesgue density point for `s`. A version for non-measurable sets
holds, but it only gives the first conclusion, see `ae_tendsto_measure_inter_div`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Differentiation/Variant393ab0f6bb0a89ac7f7fd088ee3cf59d81432a58155e84ea22633bbc9b73595c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Differentiation/Variant393ab0f6bb0a89ac7f7fd088ee3cf59d81432a58155e84ea22633bbc9b73595c.lean#L690).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4306b546065d2c8e4816f30f3507973d6ace6a16` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
