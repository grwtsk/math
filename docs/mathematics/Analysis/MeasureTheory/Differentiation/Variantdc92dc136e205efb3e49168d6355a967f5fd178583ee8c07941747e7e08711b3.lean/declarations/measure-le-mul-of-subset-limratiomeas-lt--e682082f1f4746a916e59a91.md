## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ad90514a-bc1c-9ab6-9e70-9429dd2f2a53`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 442–461.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem measure_le_mul_of_subset_limRatioMeas_lt {p : ℝ≥0} {s : Set α}
    (h : s ⊆ {x | v.limRatioMeas hρ x < p}) : ρ s ≤ p * μ s := by
  let t := {x : α | Tendsto (fun a => ρ a / μ a) (v.filterAt x) (𝓝 (v.limRatioMeas hρ x))}
  have A : μ tᶜ = 0 := v.ae_tendsto_limRatioMeas hρ
  suffices H : ρ (s ∩ t) ≤ (p • μ) (s ∩ t) by calc
    ρ s = ρ (s ∩ t ∪ s ∩ tᶜ) := by rw [inter_union_compl]
    _ ≤ ρ (s ∩ t) + ρ (s ∩ tᶜ) := measure_union_le _ _
    _ ≤ (p • μ) (s ∩ t) + ρ tᶜ := by gcongr; apply inter_subset_right
    _ ≤ p * μ (s ∩ t) := by simp [(hρ A)]
    _ ≤ p * μ s := by gcongr; apply inter_subset_left
  refine v.measure_le_of_frequently_le (p • μ) hρ _ fun x hx => ?_
  have I : ∀ᶠ b : Set α in v.filterAt x, ρ b / μ b < p := (tendsto_order.1 hx.2).2 _ (h hx.1)
  apply I.frequently.mono fun a ha => ?_
  rw [coe_nnreal_smul_apply]
  refine (ENNReal.div_le_iff_le_mul ?_ (Or.inr (bot_le.trans_lt ha).ne')).1 ha.le
  simp only [ENNReal.coe_ne_top, Ne, or_true, not_false_iff]

/-- If, for all `x` in a set `s`, one has frequently `q < ρ a / μ a`, then `q * μ s ≤ ρ s`, as
proved in `measure_le_of_frequently_le`. Since `ρ a / μ a` tends almost everywhere to
`v.limRatioMeas hρ x`, the same property holds for sets `s` on which `q < v.limRatioMeas hρ`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Differentiation/Variantdc92dc136e205efb3e49168d6355a967f5fd178583ee8c07941747e7e08711b3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Differentiation/Variantdc92dc136e205efb3e49168d6355a967f5fd178583ee8c07941747e7e08711b3.lean#L442).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `08b01aabb0be218e9f62e2fbc1deb6099d1dc2f8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
