## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:375d639d-f7d7-e435-9184-f2b7ae8e69d4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 428–434.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem aemeasurable_limRatio : AEMeasurable (v.limRatio ρ) μ := by
  apply ENNReal.aemeasurable_of_exist_almost_disjoint_supersets _ _ fun p q hpq => ?_
  exact v.exists_measurable_supersets_limRatio hρ hpq
#align vitali_family.ae_measurable_lim_ratio VitaliFamily.aemeasurable_limRatio

/-- A measurable version of `v.limRatio ρ`. Do *not* use this definition: it is only a temporary
device to show that `v.limRatio` is almost everywhere equal to the Radon-Nikodym derivative. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Differentiation/Variant95f02b83e8e0130293b502ba80b7255a3e03a4060f0c42beb254069a43fe4acb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Differentiation/Variant95f02b83e8e0130293b502ba80b7255a3e03a4060f0c42beb254069a43fe4acb.lean#L428).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cc26e1e64d5bf06020ca5e385d7ee270325dc58b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
