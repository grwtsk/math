## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d1a094b1-ee64-4f1b-4c77-ee51769b3592`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1370–1392.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    (add : ∀ ⦃f g : α → ℝ≥0∞⦄, Disjoint (support f) (support g) →
      Measurable f → Measurable g → motive f → motive g → motive (f + g))
    (iSup : ∀ ⦃f : ℕ → α → ℝ≥0∞⦄, (∀ n, Measurable (f n)) → Monotone f →
      (∀ n, motive (f n)) → motive fun x => ⨆ n, f n x)

  · exact fun n =>
      SimpleFunc.induction (fun c s hs => indicator c hs)
        (fun f g hfg hf hg => add hfg f.measurable g.measurable hf hg) (eapprox f n)

/-- To prove something for an arbitrary measurable function into `ℝ≥0∞`, it suffices to show
that the property holds for (multiples of) characteristic functions with finite mass according to
some sigma-finite measure and is closed under addition and supremum of increasing sequences of
functions.

It is possible to make the hypotheses in the induction steps a bit stronger, and such conditions
can be added once we need them (for example in `h_add` it is only necessary to consider the sum of
a simple function with a multiple of a characteristic function and that the intersection
of their images is a subset of `{0}`). -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFunc/Variantd00c13299b8f15aef01683795598b2b20b43d4c3427db2367d208de3ce03fe99.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFunc/Variantd00c13299b8f15aef01683795598b2b20b43d4c3427db2367d208de3ce03fe99.lean#L1370).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `030b849f5ae8fa0fd97e7c394d025a995dfbfbce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
