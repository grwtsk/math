## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c072dca5-c619-1164-d0b4-5112aede0cb8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 914–927.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem iSup_eapprox_apply (f : α → ℝ≥0∞) (hf : Measurable f) (a : α) :
    ⨆ n, (eapprox f n : α →ₛ ℝ≥0∞) a = f a := by
  rw [eapprox, iSup_approx_apply ennrealRatEmbed f a hf rfl]
  refine' le_antisymm (iSup_le fun i => iSup_le fun hi => hi) (le_of_not_gt _)

  have :
    (Real.toNNReal q : ℝ≥0∞) ≤ ⨆ (k : ℕ) (_ : ennrealRatEmbed k ≤ f a), ennrealRatEmbed k := by
    refine' le_iSup_of_le (Encodable.encode q) _
    rw [ennrealRatEmbed_encode q]

  exact lt_irrefl _ (lt_of_le_of_lt this lt_q)
#align measure_theory.simple_func.supr_eapprox_apply MeasureTheory.SimpleFunc.iSup_eapprox_apply

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFunc/Variant1fa7a09f47a027632ff65dbd087b0150010223eb449003d259fe48c726abe658.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFunc/Variant1fa7a09f47a027632ff65dbd087b0150010223eb449003d259fe48c726abe658.lean#L914).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e96734f0a8a716cc778a3e8f1e0bef039aff8d9d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
