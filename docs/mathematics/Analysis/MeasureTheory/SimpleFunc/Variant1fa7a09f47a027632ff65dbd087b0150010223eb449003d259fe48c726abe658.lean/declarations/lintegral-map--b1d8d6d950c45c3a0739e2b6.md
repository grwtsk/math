## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ddb5fc92-871f-efdb-8de4-bc278a6c500a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1150–1157.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem lintegral_map' {β} [MeasurableSpace β] {μ' : Measure β} (f : α →ₛ ℝ≥0∞) (g : β →ₛ ℝ≥0∞)
    (m' : α → β) (eq : ∀ a, f a = g (m' a)) (h : ∀ s, MeasurableSet s → μ' s = μ (m' ⁻¹' s)) :
    f.lintegral μ = g.lintegral μ' :=

    simp only [preimage, eq]
    exact (h (g ⁻¹' {y}) (g.measurableSet_preimage _)).symm
#align measure_theory.simple_func.lintegral_map' MeasureTheory.SimpleFunc.lintegral_map'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFunc/Variant1fa7a09f47a027632ff65dbd087b0150010223eb449003d259fe48c726abe658.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFunc/Variant1fa7a09f47a027632ff65dbd087b0150010223eb449003d259fe48c726abe658.lean#L1150).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e96734f0a8a716cc778a3e8f1e0bef039aff8d9d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
