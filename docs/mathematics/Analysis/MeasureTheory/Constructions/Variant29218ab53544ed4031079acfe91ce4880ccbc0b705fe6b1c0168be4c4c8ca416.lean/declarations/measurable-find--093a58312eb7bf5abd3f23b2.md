## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8da643fa-0802-7846-349d-a15f63a7a868`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 515–523.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem Measurable.find {_ : MeasurableSpace α} {f : ℕ → α → β} {p : ℕ → α → Prop}
    [∀ n, DecidablePred (p n)] (hf : ∀ n, Measurable (f n)) (hp : ∀ n, MeasurableSet { x | p n x })
    (h : ∀ x, ∃ n, p n x) : Measurable fun x => f (Nat.find (h x)) x :=
  have : Measurable fun p : α × ℕ => f p.2 p.1 := measurable_from_prod_countable_left fun n => hf n
  this.comp (Measurable.prodMk measurable_id (measurable_find h hp))

/-- Let `t i` be a countable covering of a set `T` by measurable sets. Let `f i : t i → β` be a
family of functions that agree on the intersections `t i ∩ t j`. Then the function
`Set.iUnionLift t f _ _ : T → β`, defined as `f i ⟨x, hx⟩` for `hx : x ∈ t i`, is measurable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Constructions/Variant29218ab53544ed4031079acfe91ce4880ccbc0b705fe6b1c0168be4c4c8ca416.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Constructions/Variant29218ab53544ed4031079acfe91ce4880ccbc0b705fe6b1c0168be4c4c8ca416.lean#L515).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b66e9602adfff1ac1f45d9adf1ce804335ebc8f3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
