## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f4bc6d9d-6242-9d70-3187-3ea96e63889f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 650–658.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measurable_piCongrLeft (f : δ' ≃ δ) : Measurable (Equiv.piCongrLeft X f) := by
  rw [measurable_pi_iff]
  intro i
  simp_rw [Equiv.piCongrLeft_apply_eq_cast]
  exact Measurable.eq_mp X (f.apply_symm_apply i) <| measurable_pi_apply <| f.symm i

/- Even though we cannot use projection notation, we still keep a dot to be consistent with similar
  lemmas, like `MeasurableSet.prod`. -/
@[measurability]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Constructions/Variantd8f504275e4e7bde1831c2b374a1880122c32873628536c4b1f050e6b1ee6ed7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Constructions/Variantd8f504275e4e7bde1831c2b374a1880122c32873628536c4b1f050e6b1ee6ed7.lean#L650).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d2d85571d9a38f90bf9905fa7340626026458abd` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
