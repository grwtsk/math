## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6c95870a-e2e1-139f-fbf9-05f2d0d4cc4e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 542–554.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measurable_liftCover [Countable ι] (t : ι → Set α) (htm : ∀ i, MeasurableSet (t i))
    (f : ∀ i, t i → β) (hfm : ∀ i, Measurable (f i))
    (hf : ∀ (i j) (x : α) (hxi : x ∈ t i) (hxj : x ∈ t j), f i ⟨x, hxi⟩ = f j ⟨x, hxj⟩)
    (htU : ⋃ i, t i = univ) :
    Measurable (liftCover t f hf htU) := fun s hs => by
  rw [preimage_liftCover]
  exact .iUnion fun i => .subtype_image (htm i) <| hfm i hs

/-- Let `t i` be a nonempty countable family of measurable sets in `α`. Let `g i : α → β` be a
family of measurable functions such that `g i` agrees with `g j` on `t i ∩ t j`. Then there exists
a measurable function `f : α → β` that agrees with each `g i` on `t i`.

We only need the assumption `[Nonempty ι]` to prove `[Nonempty (α → β)]`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Constructions/Variant8ad29fd3cb484d8f4f5a1f76e9bc88092eb07bc4e151c131e9cbabc1a6e64797.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Constructions/Variant8ad29fd3cb484d8f4f5a1f76e9bc88092eb07bc4e151c131e9cbabc1a6e64797.lean#L542).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a8f2e33dfeb38e66172d859d925dacb7d77e30ec` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
