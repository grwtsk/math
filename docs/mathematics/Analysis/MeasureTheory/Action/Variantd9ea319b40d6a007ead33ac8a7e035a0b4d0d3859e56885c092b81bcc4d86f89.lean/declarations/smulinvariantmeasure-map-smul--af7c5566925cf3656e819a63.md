## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:c367dd26701246ed3d821fe5867d387b3d2e9d158c8a68e90467f8930b9a513a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 193–219.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance smulInvariantMeasure_map_smul [SMul M α] [SMul N α] [SMulCommClass N M α]
    [MeasurableSMul M α] [MeasurableSMul N α]
    (μ : Measure α) [SMulInvariantMeasure M α μ] (n : N) :
    SMulInvariantMeasure M α (map (n • ·) μ) :=
  smulInvariantMeasure_map μ _ (smul_comm n) <| measurable_const_smul _

end SMulHomClass

variable (G) {m : MeasurableSpace α} [Group G] [MulAction G α] (μ : Measure α)

variable [MeasurableSpace G] [MeasurableSMul G α] in
/-- Equivalent definitions of a measure invariant under a multiplicative action of a group.

- 0: `SMulInvariantMeasure G α μ`;

- 1: for every `c : G` and a measurable set `s`, the measure of the preimage of `s` under scalar
     multiplication by `c` is equal to the measure of `s`;

- 2: for every `c : G` and a measurable set `s`, the measure of the image `c • s` of `s` under
     scalar multiplication by `c` is equal to the measure of `s`;

- 3, 4: properties 2, 3 for any set, including non-measurable ones;

- 5: for any `c : G`, scalar multiplication by `c` maps `μ` to `μ`;

- 6: for any `c : G`, scalar multiplication by `c` is a measure preserving map. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Action/Variantd9ea319b40d6a007ead33ac8a7e035a0b4d0d3859e56885c092b81bcc4d86f89.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Action/Variantd9ea319b40d6a007ead33ac8a7e035a0b4d0d3859e56885c092b81bcc4d86f89.lean#L193).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `71e7bac2ee329ec531f8dc4879010041826cb1b8` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
