## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1f72e650-42e4-f684-661d-1cca0403e0ad`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 133–185.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Equivalent definitions of a measure invariant under an additive action of a group.

- 0: `VAddInvariantMeasure G α μ`;

- 1: for every `c : G` and a measurable set `s`, the measure of the preimage of `s` under
     vector addition `(c +ᵥ ·)` is equal to the measure of `s`;

- 2: for every `c : G` and a measurable set `s`, the measure of the image `c +ᵥ s` of `s` under
     vector addition `(c +ᵥ ·)` is equal to the measure of `s`;

- 3, 4: properties 2, 3 for any set, including non-measurable ones;

- 5: for any `c : G`, vector addition of `c` maps `μ` to `μ`;

- 6: for any `c : G`, vector addition of `c` is a measure preserving map. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Action/Variant6404e4b910c6a39addf952fa5aacd90c66f526270aa2b9deb9b1279a9cbf7106.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Action/Variant6404e4b910c6a39addf952fa5aacd90c66f526270aa2b9deb9b1279a9cbf7106.lean#L133).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
