## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:88682e305cdf2f14928503751c75697f7b338e6f8620e0e6a24d9da288eaee18`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 50–58.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def withDensity (μ : VectorMeasure X F) (f : X → E) (B : E →L[ℝ] F →L[ℝ] G) :
    VectorMeasure X G :=
  if h : μ.Integrable f then
    { measureOf' s := ∫ᵛ x in s, f x ∂[B; μ]
      empty' := by simp
      not_measurable' s hs := setIntegral_eq_zero_of_not_measurableSet hs
      m_iUnion' s s_meas s_disj := hasSum_setIntegral_iUnion s_meas s_disj h.integrableOn }
  else 0

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/WithDensityVec/Variant032bb814f2d6be0ef142294fde3f01db316e3567a510ab3ffd01b4faf408cba7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/WithDensityVec/Variant032bb814f2d6be0ef142294fde3f01db316e3567a510ab3ffd01b4faf408cba7.lean#L50).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d576c13e2f8671f4716f3526118d6829418ef92a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
