## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1a9e1e2d-dfd4-5bb9-f8b2-aa394d3bbb84`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 826–831.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma comap_restrict (μ : Measure β) (s : Set β) :
    (μ.restrict s).comap f = (μ.comap f).restrict (f ⁻¹' s) := by
  ext t ht
  rw [Measure.restrict_apply ht, comap_apply hf, comap_apply hf,
    Measure.restrict_apply (hf.measurableSet_image.2 ht), image_inter_preimage]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Restrict/Variantb0fd1a9698f36c709adac04c0509b42d5b7ef8da400cb4bf3780c301b95ce057.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Restrict/Variantb0fd1a9698f36c709adac04c0509b42d5b7ef8da400cb4bf3780c301b95ce057.lean#L826).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e11be0390131a40e15a082da6b2c801cc994b522` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
