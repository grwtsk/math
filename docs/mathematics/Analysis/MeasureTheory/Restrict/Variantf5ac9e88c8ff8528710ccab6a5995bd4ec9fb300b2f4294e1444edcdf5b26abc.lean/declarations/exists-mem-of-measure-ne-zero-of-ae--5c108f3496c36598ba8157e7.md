## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:276b7d99-3389-7139-2d67-1787f6fcfa68`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 421–427.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_mem_of_measure_ne_zero_of_ae (hs : μ s ≠ 0) {p : α → Prop}
    (hp : ∀ᵐ x ∂μ.restrict s, p x) : ∃ x, x ∈ s ∧ p x := by
  rw [← μ.restrict_apply_self, ← frequently_ae_mem_iff] at hs
  exact (hs.and_eventually hp).exists

/-- If a quasi-measure-preserving map `f` maps a set `s` to a set `t`,
then it is quasi-measure-preserving with respect to the restrictions of the measures. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Restrict/Variantf5ac9e88c8ff8528710ccab6a5995bd4ec9fb300b2f4294e1444edcdf5b26abc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Restrict/Variantf5ac9e88c8ff8528710ccab6a5995bd4ec9fb300b2f4294e1444edcdf5b26abc.lean#L421).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `60dd86c0e32b77a79143d34862502b3514caa149` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
