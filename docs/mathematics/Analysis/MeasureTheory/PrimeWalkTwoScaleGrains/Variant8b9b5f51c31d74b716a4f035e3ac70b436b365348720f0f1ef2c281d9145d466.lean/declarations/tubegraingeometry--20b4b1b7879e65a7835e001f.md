## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `structure` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:627f523efe611eb44343fcceb31f8466e301bdccd6d14696473d157d9f15002e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 138–161.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
structure TubeGrainGeometry
    (Point FineTube CoarseTube Grain : Type*) where
  fineCarrier : FineTube → Set Point
  coarseCarrier : CoarseTube → Set Point
  grainCarrier : Grain → Set Point
  directionAngle : Grain → CoarseTube → ℝ
  exitsLongEnd : FineTube → Grain → Prop

/-! ## Wang--Zahl Definition 7.1 as a certificate -/

/-- A robustly dense two-scale grains certificate.

The fields are grouped in the same order as Wang--Zahl Definition 7.1:

1. unique coarse association, containment, and direction control for grains;
2. disjoint grain shadings and exact shading partition in each coarse tube;
3. `λ`-density and essentially uniform fine-tube multiplicity (made explicit
   here as the interval `[multiplicity, 2 * multiplicity]`);
4. long-end exit and containment of the tube/grain intersection in the grain
   shading.

The additional `fine*` fields state that the coarse tubes form a balanced
partitioning cover of the fine tubes.  Balance is represented by the literal
factor `2` used for an unqualified balanced cover in the paper. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/PrimeWalkTwoScaleGrains/Variant8b9b5f51c31d74b716a4f035e3ac70b436b365348720f0f1ef2c281d9145d466.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/PrimeWalkTwoScaleGrains/Variant8b9b5f51c31d74b716a4f035e3ac70b436b365348720f0f1ef2c281d9145d466.lean#L138).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f7ecb8bba1cfd742bb799c32ad6050542d1a0021` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
