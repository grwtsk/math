## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:e333b2e8efff28f369309226af6abd1b631deb69537409b92ceb8d6798828a87`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 849–854.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance MeasurableSpace.pi [m : ∀ a, MeasurableSpace (π a)] : MeasurableSpace (∀ a, π a) :=
  ⨆ a, (m a).comap fun b => b a
#align measurable_space.pi MeasurableSpace.pi

variable [∀ a, MeasurableSpace (π a)] [MeasurableSpace γ]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasurableSpace/Variant7962df4ca1758e64de912f628894268086bd58a5a3b8ebdba2ce439f7b2fc3a4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasurableSpace/Variant7962df4ca1758e64de912f628894268086bd58a5a3b8ebdba2ce439f7b2fc3a4.lean#L849).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2d2f52c5118c131737a20aeb6d6dcf346b7a8d3d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
