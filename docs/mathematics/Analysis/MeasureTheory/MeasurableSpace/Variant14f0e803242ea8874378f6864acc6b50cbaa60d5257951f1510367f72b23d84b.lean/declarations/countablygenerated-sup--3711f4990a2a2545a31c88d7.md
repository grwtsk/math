## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:879ac5b5-8800-a904-e9ba-6a8c0ff473db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 1677–1682.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem CountablyGenerated.sup {m₁ m₂ : MeasurableSpace β} (h₁ : @CountablyGenerated β m₁)
    (h₂ : @CountablyGenerated β m₂) : @CountablyGenerated β (m₁ ⊔ m₂) := by
  rcases h₁ with ⟨⟨b₁, hb₁c, rfl⟩⟩
  rcases h₂ with ⟨⟨b₂, hb₂c, rfl⟩⟩
  exact @mk _ (_ ⊔ _) ⟨_, hb₁c.union hb₂c, generateFrom_sup_generateFrom⟩

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasurableSpace/Variant14f0e803242ea8874378f6864acc6b50cbaa60d5257951f1510367f72b23d84b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasurableSpace/Variant14f0e803242ea8874378f6864acc6b50cbaa60d5257951f1510367f72b23d84b.lean#L1677).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e51105a40977d1286645bc459af9079358484129` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
