## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4a787e6d-5d82-fdd3-be3d-ccf648b48e12`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 273–290.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measure_inter_add_sdiff₀ (s : Set α) (ht : NullMeasurableSet t μ) :
    μ (s ∩ t) + μ (s \ t) = μ s := by
  refine le_antisymm ?_ (measure_le_inter_add_sdiff _ _ _)
  rcases exists_measurable_superset μ s with ⟨s', hsub, hs'm, hs'⟩
  replace hs'm : NullMeasurableSet s' μ := hs'm.nullMeasurableSet
  calc
    μ (s ∩ t) + μ (s \ t) ≤ μ (s' ∩ t) + μ (s' \ t) := by gcongr
    _ = μ (s' ∩ t ∪ s' \ t) :=
      (measure_union₀_aux (hs'm.inter ht) (hs'm.diff ht) <|
          (@disjoint_inf_sdiff _ s' t _).aedisjoint).symm
    _ = μ s' := congr_arg μ (inter_union_sdiff _ _)
    _ = μ s := hs'

@[deprecated (since := "2026-06-03")] alias measure_inter_add_diff₀ := measure_inter_add_sdiff₀

/-- If `s` and `t` are null measurable sets of equal measure
and their intersection has finite measure,
then `s \ t` and `t \ s` have equal measures too. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/NullMeasurable/Variant3124126b52d19ee233546b898cd6fba99ab5674b8c664be1d473460fdae443be.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/NullMeasurable/Variant3124126b52d19ee233546b898cd6fba99ab5674b8c664be1d473460fdae443be.lean#L273).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `49d073ffc1454555ebb7fd4ae5a97e2c39805612` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
