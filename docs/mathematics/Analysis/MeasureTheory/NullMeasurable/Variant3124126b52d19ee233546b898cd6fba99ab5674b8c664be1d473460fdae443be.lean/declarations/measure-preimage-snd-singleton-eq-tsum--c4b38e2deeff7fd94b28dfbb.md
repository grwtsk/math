## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5dc5257e-2552-25b1-9da9-d435b13d5df2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 376–380.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma measure_preimage_snd_singleton_eq_tsum [Countable α] (μ : Measure (α × β)) (y : β) :
    μ (Prod.snd ⁻¹' {y}) = ∑' x, μ {(x, y)} := by
  have : Prod.snd ⁻¹' {y} = ⋃ x : α, {(x, y)} := by ext y; simp [Prod.ext_iff, eq_comm]
  rw [this, measure_iUnion] <;> simp [Pairwise]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/NullMeasurable/Variant3124126b52d19ee233546b898cd6fba99ab5674b8c664be1d473460fdae443be.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/NullMeasurable/Variant3124126b52d19ee233546b898cd6fba99ab5674b8c664be1d473460fdae443be.lean#L376).

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
