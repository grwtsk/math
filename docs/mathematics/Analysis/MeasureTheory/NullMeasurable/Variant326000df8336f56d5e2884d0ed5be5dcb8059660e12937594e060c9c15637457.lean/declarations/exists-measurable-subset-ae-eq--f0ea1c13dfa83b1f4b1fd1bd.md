## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:97634bde-2c84-0936-2bc8-c7e994c205c1`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 253–265.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_measurable_subset_ae_eq (h : NullMeasurableSet s μ) :
    ∃ (t : _) (_ : t ⊆ s), MeasurableSet t ∧ t =ᵐ[μ] s :=
  ⟨(toMeasurable μ sᶜ)ᶜ, compl_subset_comm.2 <| subset_toMeasurable _ _,
    (measurableSet_toMeasurable _ _).compl, compl_toMeasurable_compl_ae_eq h⟩
#align measure_theory.null_measurable_set.exists_measurable_subset_ae_eq MeasureTheory.NullMeasurableSet.exists_measurable_subset_ae_eq

end NullMeasurableSet

open NullMeasurableSet

/-- If `sᵢ` is a countable family of (null) measurable pairwise `μ`-a.e. disjoint sets, then there
exists a subordinate family `tᵢ ⊆ sᵢ` of measurable pairwise disjoint sets such that
`tᵢ =ᵐ[μ] sᵢ`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/NullMeasurable/Variant326000df8336f56d5e2884d0ed5be5dcb8059660e12937594e060c9c15637457.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/NullMeasurable/Variant326000df8336f56d5e2884d0ed5be5dcb8059660e12937594e060c9c15637457.lean#L253).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `114f14d2c1a5a560139b889353edd6e6b223808f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
