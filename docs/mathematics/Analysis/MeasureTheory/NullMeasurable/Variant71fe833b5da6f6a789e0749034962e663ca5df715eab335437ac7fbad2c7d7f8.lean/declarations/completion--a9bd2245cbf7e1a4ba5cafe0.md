## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:eedc150a9f2f56040be288d9e3b10f42d6b16f733495c9b110a876112e760bfb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 483–496.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def completion {_ : MeasurableSpace α} (μ : Measure α) :
    @MeasureTheory.Measure (NullMeasurableSpace α μ) _ where
  toOuterMeasure := μ.toOuterMeasure
  m_iUnion s hs hd := measure_iUnion₀ (hd.mono fun i j h => h.aedisjoint) hs
  trimmed := by
    refine' le_antisymm (fun s => _)
      (@OuterMeasure.le_trim (NullMeasurableSpace α μ) _ _)
    rw [@OuterMeasure.trim_eq_iInf (NullMeasurableSpace α μ) _];
    have : ∀ s, μ.toOuterMeasure s = μ s := by simp only [forall_const]
    rw [this, measure_eq_iInf]
    apply iInf₂_mono
    exact fun t _ht => iInf_mono' fun h => ⟨MeasurableSet.nullMeasurableSet h, le_rfl⟩
#align measure_theory.measure.completion MeasureTheory.Measure.completion

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/NullMeasurable/Variant71fe833b5da6f6a789e0749034962e663ca5df715eab335437ac7fbad2c7d7f8.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/NullMeasurable/Variant71fe833b5da6f6a789e0749034962e663ca5df715eab335437ac7fbad2c7d7f8.lean#L483).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `093d65b73a744a094182289d1e3573a3995b8d4c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
