## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8f347d89-d0c4-1c97-d406-b9c36b358f11`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 176–206.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

section Bilinear

/-!
In this section, we show that `‖fg‖_{L^r} ≤ ‖f‖_{L^p} ‖g‖_{L^q}` when `1/r = 1/p + 1/q`, in a more
general version involving a general bilinear form.

There is one edge case where this formula does not hold with our conventions: if `r = p = 0`, `f`
is measurable but `fg` is not, then `‖fg‖_{L^r} = ∞` while `‖f‖_{L^p} ‖g‖_{L^q} = 0 * ∞ = 0`.
So, we should either assume that `r` is nonzero, or the functions are measurable. Most lemmas
are given in the two versions, with the main one assuming measurability, and the other version
(suffixed with `of_pos`) assume `0 < r`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CompareExp/Variant8815b7b1ea215b2cbe1e04c0999bad2be17347aa588d174adda1eaa42ad40853.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CompareExp/Variant8815b7b1ea215b2cbe1e04c0999bad2be17347aa588d174adda1eaa42ad40853.lean#L176).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0e5583391e8a71d8008933342f40cfa89d134704` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
