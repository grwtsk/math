## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:731fbb32-bd10-0bc8-26a7-413a32359bac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 96–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem eLpNorm'_le_eLpNorm'_of_exponent_le {p q : ℝ} (hp0_lt : 0 < p)
    (hpq : p ≤ q) (μ : Measure α) [IsProbabilityMeasure μ] (hf : AEStronglyMeasurable f μ) :
    eLpNorm' f p μ ≤ eLpNorm' f q μ := by
  have h_le_μ := eLpNorm'_le_eLpNorm'_mul_rpow_measure_univ hp0_lt hpq hf
  rwa [measure_univ, ENNReal.one_rpow, mul_one] at h_le_μ

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CompareExp/Varianted0a5dd6875e85512408b98af533485adcebdf17179a4315de918fde6207c85f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CompareExp/Varianted0a5dd6875e85512408b98af533485adcebdf17179a4315de918fde6207c85f.lean#L96).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b30f60e6cbe03298f63d040e626c201be6cad807` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
