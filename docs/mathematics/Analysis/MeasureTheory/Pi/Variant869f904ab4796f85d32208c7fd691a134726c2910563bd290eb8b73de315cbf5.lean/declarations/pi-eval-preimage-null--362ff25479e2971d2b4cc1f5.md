## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0b9d85d6-4bee-7004-bc46-55474905ca8d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 367–377.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem pi_eval_preimage_null {i : ι} {s : Set (α i)} (hs : μ i s = 0) :
    Measure.pi μ (eval i ⁻¹' s) = 0 := by
  classical
  -- WLOG, `s` is measurable
  rcases exists_measurable_superset_of_null hs with ⟨t, hst, _, hμt⟩
  suffices Measure.pi μ (eval i ⁻¹' t) = 0 from measure_mono_null (preimage_mono hst) this
  -- Now rewrite it as `Set.pi`, and apply `pi_pi`
  rw [← univ_pi_update_univ, pi_pi]
  apply Finset.prod_eq_zero (Finset.mem_univ i)
  simp [hμt]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Pi/Variant869f904ab4796f85d32208c7fd691a134726c2910563bd290eb8b73de315cbf5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Pi/Variant869f904ab4796f85d32208c7fd691a134726c2910563bd290eb8b73de315cbf5.lean#L367).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2bda5be28956dcce27306c9b51fdb7eeca526f1b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
