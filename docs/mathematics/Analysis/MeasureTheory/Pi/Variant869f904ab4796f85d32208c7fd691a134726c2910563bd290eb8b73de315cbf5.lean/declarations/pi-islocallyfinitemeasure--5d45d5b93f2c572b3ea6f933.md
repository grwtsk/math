## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6c9262e741980a94ae8b4c507781f1178d8d8b349cf3389a5e577c4255261aeb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 544–552.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance pi.isLocallyFiniteMeasure
    [∀ i, TopologicalSpace (α i)] [∀ i, IsLocallyFiniteMeasure (μ i)] :
    IsLocallyFiniteMeasure (Measure.pi μ) := by
  refine ⟨fun x => ?_⟩
  choose s hxs ho hμ using fun i => (μ i).exists_isOpen_measure_lt_top (x i)
  refine ⟨pi univ s, set_pi_mem_nhds finite_univ fun i _ => IsOpen.mem_nhds (ho i) (hxs i), ?_⟩
  rw [pi_pi]
  exact ENNReal.prod_lt_top fun i _ => hμ i

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Pi/Variant869f904ab4796f85d32208c7fd691a134726c2910563bd290eb8b73de315cbf5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Pi/Variant869f904ab4796f85d32208c7fd691a134726c2910563bd290eb8b73de315cbf5.lean#L544).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2bda5be28956dcce27306c9b51fdb7eeca526f1b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
