## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:829c00b5-18a1-eb72-ec40-b60d9eac8036`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 681–689.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measurePreserving_piCongrLeft (f : ι' ≃ ι) :
    MeasurePreserving (MeasurableEquiv.piCongrLeft α f)
      (Measure.pi fun i' => μ (f i')) (Measure.pi μ) where
  measurable := (MeasurableEquiv.piCongrLeft α f).measurable
  map_eq := by
    refine (pi_eq fun s _ => ?_).symm
    rw [MeasurableEquiv.map_apply, MeasurableEquiv.coe_piCongrLeft f,
      Equiv.piCongrLeft_preimage_univ_pi, pi_pi _ _, f.prod_comp (fun i => μ i (s i))]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Pi/Variant3ef3cc6fbd6806ee2278748309978602ffd597e98952098d45adecd382b2e611.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Pi/Variant3ef3cc6fbd6806ee2278748309978602ffd597e98952098d45adecd382b2e611.lean#L681).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `162b60fdc26deae210eb860d0eae58f1a6e4e9d4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
