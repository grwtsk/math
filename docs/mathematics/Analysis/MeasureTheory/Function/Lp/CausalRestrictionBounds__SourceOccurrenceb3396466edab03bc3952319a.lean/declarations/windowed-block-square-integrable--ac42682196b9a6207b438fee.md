## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:035c51fd-a1e7-b4c4-7ff7-ff0a31de8745`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 40–48.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem windowed_block_square_integrable (P B : Finset ℕ)
    (hP : ∀ p ∈ P, Nat.Prime p) (T : ℝ) :
    Integrable (fun u => blockAction B (PPNCP04.restrict T (PPNCP04.primeState P)) u ^ 2) := by
  have hs : MemLp (PPNCP04.restrict T (PPNCP04.primeState P)) 2 volume :=
    ASBNP04.FiniteProduct.restricted_source_memLp_two P hP T
  have hb := cascade_memLp_two B.toList hs
  have hi := hb.integrable_norm_pow (by decide : (2 : ℕ) ≠ 0)
  simpa only [blockAction, Real.norm_eq_abs, sq_abs] using hi

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Function/Lp/CausalRestrictionBounds__SourceOccurrenceb3396466edab03bc3952319a.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/MeasureTheory/Function/Lp/CausalRestrictionBounds.lean#L40).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c83c17b74b01115b239801fcb180c5c5b5ab42d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
