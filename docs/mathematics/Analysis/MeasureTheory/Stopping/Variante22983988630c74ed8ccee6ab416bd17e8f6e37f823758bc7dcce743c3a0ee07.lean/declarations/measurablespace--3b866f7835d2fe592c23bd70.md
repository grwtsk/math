## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:aa154b90a791cc21eda71a91adb2c502e71f7374a306e51d16e7d7da25b42a3b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 294–309.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected def measurableSpace (hτ : IsStoppingTime f τ) : MeasurableSpace Ω where
  MeasurableSet' s := ∀ i : ι, MeasurableSet[f i] (s ∩ {ω | τ ω ≤ i})
  measurableSet_empty i := (Set.empty_inter {ω | τ ω ≤ i}).symm ▸ @MeasurableSet.empty _ (f i)
  measurableSet_compl s hs i := by
    rw [(_ : sᶜ ∩ {ω | τ ω ≤ i} = (sᶜ ∪ {ω | τ ω ≤ i}ᶜ) ∩ {ω | τ ω ≤ i})]
    · refine MeasurableSet.inter ?_ ?_
      · rw [← Set.compl_inter]
        exact (hs i).compl
      · exact hτ i
    · rw [Set.union_inter_distrib_right]
      simp only [Set.compl_inter_self, Set.union_empty]
  measurableSet_iUnion s hs i := by
    rw [forall_swap] at hs
    rw [Set.iUnion_inter]
    exact MeasurableSet.iUnion (hs i)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Stopping/Variante22983988630c74ed8ccee6ab416bd17e8f6e37f823758bc7dcce743c3a0ee07.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Stopping/Variante22983988630c74ed8ccee6ab416bd17e8f6e37f823758bc7dcce743c3a0ee07.lean#L294).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `fd95734aac8ff9650c4beba0d74e2339ae49b40b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
