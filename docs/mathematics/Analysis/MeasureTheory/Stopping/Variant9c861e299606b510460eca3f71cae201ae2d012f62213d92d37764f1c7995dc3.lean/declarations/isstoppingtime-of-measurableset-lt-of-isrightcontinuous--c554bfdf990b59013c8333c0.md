## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:33839000-ca52-654a-2d26-a98d62971c4e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 335–346.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma isStoppingTime_of_measurableSet_lt_of_isRightContinuous [DenselyOrdered ι] [NoMaxOrder ι]
    {τ : Ω → WithTop ι} [f.IsRightContinuous] (hτ : ∀ i, MeasurableSet[f i] {ω | τ ω < i}) :
    IsStoppingTime f τ :=
  isStoppingTime_of_measurableSet_lt_of_isRightContinuous' hτ
    <| fun _ hi ↦ absurd hi (NeBot.ne inferInstance)

end IsRightContinuous

end MeasurableSet

namespace IsStoppingTime

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Stopping/Variant9c861e299606b510460eca3f71cae201ae2d012f62213d92d37764f1c7995dc3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Stopping/Variant9c861e299606b510460eca3f71cae201ae2d012f62213d92d37764f1c7995dc3.lean#L335).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `25c9a07faa8890caf333b83750be2ecf7d4bdb48` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
