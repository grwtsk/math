## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ddf24739-0880-b232-b72d-b1af7610f460`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 737–745.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measurableSet_inter_le_const_iff (hτ : IsStoppingTime f τ) (s : Set Ω) (i : ι) :
    MeasurableSet[hτ.measurableSpace] (s ∩ {ω | τ ω ≤ i}) ↔
      MeasurableSet[(hτ.min_const i).measurableSpace] (s ∩ {ω | τ ω ≤ i}) := by
  rw [IsStoppingTime.measurableSet_min_iff hτ (isStoppingTime_const _ i),
    IsStoppingTime.measurableSpace_const, IsStoppingTime.measurableSet]
  refine ⟨fun h => ⟨h, ?_⟩, fun h ↦ h.1⟩
  have h' := h.2 i
  rwa [Set.inter_assoc, Set.inter_self] at h'

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Stopping/Variant38d608b4f30295c1fe84e336ecc0e5ee90c064a531bf7e142bbd73d5100a8c39.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Stopping/Variant38d608b4f30295c1fe84e336ecc0e5ee90c064a531bf7e142bbd73d5100a8c39.lean#L737).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b25a083f6a1b210f988357fb835770c3f90b68da` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
