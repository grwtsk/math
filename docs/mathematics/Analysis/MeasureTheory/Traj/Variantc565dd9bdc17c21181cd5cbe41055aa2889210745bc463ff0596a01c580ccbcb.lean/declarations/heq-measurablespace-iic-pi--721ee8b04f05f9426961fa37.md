## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d35b65dc-8ca8-14ae-1655-3d1a351ef10c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–107.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

private lemma heq_measurableSpace_Iic_pi {a b : ℕ} (h : a = b) :
    HEq (inferInstance : MeasurableSpace (Π i : Iic a, X i))
    (inferInstance : MeasurableSpace (Π i : Iic b, X i)) := by cases h; rfl

end castLemmas

section iterateInduction

/-- This function takes as input a tuple `(x_₀, ..., x_ₐ)` and `ind` a function which
given `(y_₀, ...,y_ₙ)` outputs `x_{n+1} : X (n + 1)`, and it builds an element of `Π n, X n`
by starting with `(x_₀, ..., x_ₐ)` and then iterating `ind`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Traj/Variantc565dd9bdc17c21181cd5cbe41055aa2889210745bc463ff0596a01c580ccbcb.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Traj/Variantc565dd9bdc17c21181cd5cbe41055aa2889210745bc463ff0596a01c580ccbcb.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `d74cf76d06abd4ac83e88e8a06b16bc1fc84a710` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
