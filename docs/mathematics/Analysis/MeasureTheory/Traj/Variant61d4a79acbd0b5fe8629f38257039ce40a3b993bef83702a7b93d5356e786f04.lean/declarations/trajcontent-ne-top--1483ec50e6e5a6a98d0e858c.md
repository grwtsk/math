## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b9b15cab-9117-a588-5d70-ca8918913870`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 252–263.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma trajContent_ne_top {a : ℕ} {x : Π i : Iic a, X i} {s : Set (Π n, X n)} :
    trajContent κ x s ≠ ∞ :=
  projectiveFamilyContent_ne_top (isProjectiveMeasureFamily_partialTraj κ x)

/-- This is an auxiliary result for `trajContent_tendsto_zero`. Consider `f` a sequence of bounded
measurable functions such that `f n` depends only on the first coordinates up to `a n`.
Assume that when integrating `f n` against `partialTraj (k + 1) (a n)`, one gets a non-increasing
sequence of functions which converges to `l`.
Assume then that there exists `ε` and `y : Π i : Iic k, X i` such that
when integrating `f n` against `partialTraj k (a n) y`, you get something at least
`ε` for all `n`. Then there exists `z` such that this remains true when integrating
`f` against `partialTraj (k + 1) (a n) (update y (k + 1) z)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Traj/Variant61d4a79acbd0b5fe8629f38257039ce40a3b993bef83702a7b93d5356e786f04.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Traj/Variant61d4a79acbd0b5fe8629f38257039ce40a3b993bef83702a7b93d5356e786f04.lean#L252).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `aecab82187dd1a96d6b92c32351b800965fcd31d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
