## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b45c8933-8b8b-fc76-bf04-42dada832c05`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 145–152.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_gt_measure_inter_ne_zero (hf : Conservative f μ) (hs : NullMeasurableSet s μ)
    (h0 : μ s ≠ 0) (N : ℕ) : ∃ m > N, μ (s ∩ f^[m] ⁻¹' s) ≠ 0 :=
  let ⟨m, hm, hmN⟩ :=
    ((hf.frequently_measure_inter_ne_zero hs h0).and_eventually (eventually_gt_atTop N)).exists
  ⟨m, hmN, hm⟩

/-- Poincaré recurrence theorem: given a conservative map `f` and a measurable set `s`, the set
of points `x ∈ s` such that `x` does not return to `s` after `≥ n` iterations has measure zero. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Conservative/Variant0aa2455b6fb397f8ead6a26a199368d6490ac134e46df6a6a11e285e7daaddd0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Conservative/Variant0aa2455b6fb397f8ead6a26a199368d6490ac134e46df6a6a11e285e7daaddd0.lean#L145).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `035f978aa871877a4fe58fdd2966c86426f6e01e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
