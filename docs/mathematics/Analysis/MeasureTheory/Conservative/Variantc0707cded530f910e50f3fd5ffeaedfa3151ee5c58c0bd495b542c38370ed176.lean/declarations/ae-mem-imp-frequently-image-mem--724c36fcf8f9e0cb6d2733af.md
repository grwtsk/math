## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:692c8448-1cc0-7839-8651-c54328ea2753`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 159–166.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ae_mem_imp_frequently_image_mem (hf : Conservative f μ) (hs : NullMeasurableSet s μ) :
    ∀ᵐ x ∂μ, x ∈ s → ∃ᶠ n in atTop, f^[n] x ∈ s := by
  simp only [frequently_atTop, @forall_comm (_ ∈ s), ae_all_iff]
  intro n
  filter_upwards
    [measure_eq_zero_iff_ae_notMem.1 (hf.measure_mem_forall_ge_image_notMem_eq_zero hs n)]
  simp

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Conservative/Variantc0707cded530f910e50f3fd5ffeaedfa3151ee5c58c0bd495b542c38370ed176.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Conservative/Variantc0707cded530f910e50f3fd5ffeaedfa3151ee5c58c0bd495b542c38370ed176.lean#L159).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d75ffacf7e71c079dff788ec254bd331626c0fb` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
