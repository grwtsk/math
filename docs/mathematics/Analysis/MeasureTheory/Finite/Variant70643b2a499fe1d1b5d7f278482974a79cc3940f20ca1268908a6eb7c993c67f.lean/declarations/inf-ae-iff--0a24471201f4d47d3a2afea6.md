## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7cc23b88-d8ba-c641-8c90-47c819301037`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 443–450.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem inf_ae_iff : μ.FiniteAtFilter (f ⊓ ae μ) ↔ μ.FiniteAtFilter f := by
  refine ⟨?_, fun h => h.filter_mono inf_le_left⟩
  rintro ⟨s, ⟨t, ht, u, hu, rfl⟩, hμ⟩
  suffices μ t ≤ μ (t ∩ u) from ⟨t, ht, this.trans_lt hμ⟩
  exact measure_mono_ae (mem_of_superset hu fun x hu ht => ⟨ht, hu⟩)

alias ⟨of_inf_ae, _⟩ := inf_ae_iff

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Finite/Variant70643b2a499fe1d1b5d7f278482974a79cc3940f20ca1268908a6eb7c993c67f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Finite/Variant70643b2a499fe1d1b5d7f278482974a79cc3940f20ca1268908a6eb7c993c67f.lean#L443).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `082df792375117dadcb67e2f16120a41a068ced0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
