## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:573a4c93-7d3e-2333-fc1d-47341ba00b0f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 341–356.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem aemeasurable_withDensity_ennreal_iff {f : α → ℝ≥0} (hf : Measurable f) {g : α → ℝ≥0∞} :
    AEMeasurable g (μ.withDensity fun x => (f x : ℝ≥0∞)) ↔
      AEMeasurable (fun x => (f x : ℝ≥0∞) * g x) μ :=
  aemeasurable_withDensity_ennreal_iff' <| hf.aemeasurable

open MeasureTheory.SimpleFunc

/-- This is Exercise 1.2.1 from [tao2010]. It allows you to express integration of a measurable
function with respect to `(μ.withDensity f)` as an integral with respect to `μ`, called the base
measure. `μ` is often the Lebesgue measure, and in this circumstance `f` is the probability density
function, and `(μ.withDensity f)` represents any continuous random variable as a
probability measure, such as the uniform distribution between 0 and 1, the Gaussian distribution,
the exponential distribution, the Beta distribution, or the Cauchy distribution (see Section 2.4
of [wasserman2004]). Thus, this method shows how to one can calculate expectations, variances,
and other moments as a function of the probability density function.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/WithDensity/Variant62cc2f6eb975f380a270e7a9f17bd26380778abf82023876a91f672442ea5313.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/WithDensity/Variant62cc2f6eb975f380a270e7a9f17bd26380778abf82023876a91f672442ea5313.lean#L341).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `13b8bced081feb62dc5a16e2ce9acac3981bf1d1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
