## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d007d1bc-b034-bb0c-91db-8e2edab6024d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 532–537.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem setLIntegral_withDensity_eq_setLIntegral_mul_non_measurable₀' (μ : Measure α) [SFinite μ]
    {f : α → ℝ≥0∞} (s : Set α) (hf : AEMeasurable f (μ.restrict s)) (g : α → ℝ≥0∞)
    (h'f : ∀ᵐ x ∂μ.restrict s, f x < ∞) :
    ∫⁻ a in s, g a ∂μ.withDensity f = ∫⁻ a in s, (f * g) a ∂μ := by
  rw [restrict_withDensity' s, lintegral_withDensity_eq_lintegral_mul_non_measurable₀ _ hf h'f]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/WithDensity/Variant2b877d2d0e6b6c65ccb5c14719c1464d20ce80df1d09d03fd8f8ad66f040ade5.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/WithDensity/Variant2b877d2d0e6b6c65ccb5c14719c1464d20ce80df1d09d03fd8f8ad66f040ade5.lean#L532).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5614894732293f9dbc288ad091284a54d909a3f4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
