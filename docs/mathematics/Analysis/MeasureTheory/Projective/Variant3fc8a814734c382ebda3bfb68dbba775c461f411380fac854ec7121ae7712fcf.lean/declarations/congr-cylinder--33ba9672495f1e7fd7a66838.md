## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:60e5736a-18f0-ce5d-9044-209338e1e0ba`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 97–116.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

lemma congr_cylinder (hP : IsProjectiveMeasureFamily P)
    {S : Set (∀ i : I, α i)} {T : Set (∀ i : J, α i)} (hS : MeasurableSet S) (hT : MeasurableSet T)
    (h_eq : cylinder I S = cylinder J T) :
    P I S = P J T := by

  let U := Finset.restrict₂ Finset.subset_union_left ⁻¹' S ∩

  · have h_eq_union : cylinder J T = cylinder (I ∪ J) U := by
      rw [← inter_cylinder, h_eq, inter_self]
    exact hP.congr_cylinder_of_subset hT h_eq_union.symm Finset.subset_union_right

end IsProjectiveMeasureFamily

/-- A measure `μ` is the projective limit of a family of measures indexed by finite sets of `ι` if
for all `I : Finset ι`, the projection from `∀ i, α i` to `∀ i : I, α i` maps `μ` to `P I`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Projective/Variant3fc8a814734c382ebda3bfb68dbba775c461f411380fac854ec7121ae7712fcf.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Projective/Variant3fc8a814734c382ebda3bfb68dbba775c461f411380fac854ec7121ae7712fcf.lean#L97).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b6914e760103e31f31413badd03fbc1aec60d26f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
