## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:81dfc4d0-18fe-be43-b7e5-38785eeb4ba6`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 57–67.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma eq_zero_of_isEmpty [h : IsEmpty (Π i, α i)]
    (hP : IsProjectiveMeasureFamily P) (I : Finset ι) :
    P I = 0 := by
  classical
  obtain ⟨i, hi⟩ := isEmpty_pi.mp h
  rw [hP (insert i I) I (I.subset_insert i)]
  have : IsEmpty (Π j : ↑(insert i I), α j) := by simp [hi]
  rw [(P (insert i I)).eq_zero_of_isEmpty]
  simp

/-- Auxiliary lemma for `measure_univ_eq`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Projective/Variant143f24dccfc65026dddd5ba63f9bdf4a4b7b1afc0e74415e84e050a0eb81a7bd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Projective/Variant143f24dccfc65026dddd5ba63f9bdf4a4b7b1afc0e74415e84e050a0eb81a7bd.lean#L57).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `52b3d3887508ef8a4318d1e2a202862d171f71ce` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
