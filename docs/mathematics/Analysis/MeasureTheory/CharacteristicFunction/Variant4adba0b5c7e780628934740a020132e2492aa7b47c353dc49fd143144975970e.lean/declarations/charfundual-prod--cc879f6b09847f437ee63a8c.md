## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:a1ed6170-8243-750e-2f9f-237134b615dc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 283–294.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma charFunDual_prod [SFinite μ] [SFinite ν] (L : Dual ℝ (E × F)) :
    charFunDual (μ.prod ν) L
      = charFunDual μ (L.comp (.inl ℝ E F)) * charFunDual ν (L.comp (.inr ℝ E F)) := by
  let L₁ : Dual ℝ E := L.comp (.inl ℝ E F)
  let L₂ : Dual ℝ F := L.comp (.inr ℝ E F)
  simp_rw [charFunDual_apply, ← L.comp_inl_add_comp_inr, ofReal_add, add_mul,
    Complex.exp_add]
  rw [integral_prod_mul (f := fun x ↦ cexp ((L₁ x * I))) (g := fun x ↦ cexp ((L₂ x * I)))]

variable [BorelSpace E] [SecondCountableTopology E]

/-- If two finite measures have the same characteristic function, then they are equal. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CharacteristicFunction/Variant4adba0b5c7e780628934740a020132e2492aa7b47c353dc49fd143144975970e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CharacteristicFunction/Variant4adba0b5c7e780628934740a020132e2492aa7b47c353dc49fd143144975970e.lean#L283).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cfe39edd793ec429e617eca068248d1f1cb8d4b5` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
