## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5b117906-35c7-6b9b-c9db-3ed7c31f8a59`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 49–65.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem measure_limsup_cofinite_eq_zero {s : ι → Set α} (hs : ∑' i, μ (s i) ≠ ∞) :
    μ (limsup s cofinite) = 0 := by
  refine bot_unique <| ge_of_tendsto' (ENNReal.tendsto_tsum_compl_atTop_zero hs) fun t ↦ ?_
  calc
    μ (limsup s cofinite) ≤ μ (⋃ i : {i // i ∉ t}, s i) := by

      exact iInter₂_subset _ t.finite_toSet
    _ ≤ ∑' i : {i // i ∉ t}, μ (s i) := measure_iUnion_le _

/-- One direction of the **Borel-Cantelli lemma**
(sometimes called the "*first* Borel-Cantelli lemma"):
if `(s i)` is a sequence of sets such that `∑' i, μ (s i)` is finite,
then the limit superior of the `s i` along the `atTop` filter is a null set.

Note: for the *second* Borel-Cantelli lemma (applying to independent sets in a probability space),
see `ProbabilityTheory.measure_limsup_eq_one`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/BorelCantelli/Variantcaa207437a072bfb41fcf42ac6f3b3a69d9952fc2f0e846a81b849f03ad1afaa.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/BorelCantelli/Variantcaa207437a072bfb41fcf42ac6f3b3a69d9952fc2f0e846a81b849f03ad1afaa.lean#L49).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `dc98ab1ba7490e5190cb81a39d601285b1ab12f0` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
