## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:6f8a22c6-0666-6682-95c7-ad9601532923`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 78–89.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem ae_finite_setOfPred_mem {s : ι → Set α} (h : ∑' i, μ (s i) ≠ ∞) :
    ∀ᵐ x ∂μ, {i | x ∈ s i}.Finite := by
  rw [ae_iff, ← measure_limsup_cofinite_eq_zero h]
  congr 1 with x
  simp [mem_limsup_iff_frequently_mem, Filter.Frequently]

@[deprecated (since := "2026-07-09")]
alias ae_finite_setOf_mem := ae_finite_setOfPred_mem

/-- A version of the **Borel-Cantelli lemma**: if `pᵢ` is a sequence of predicates such that
`∑' i, μ {x | pᵢ x}` is finite, then the measure of `x` such that `pᵢ x` holds frequently as `i → ∞`
(or equivalently, `pᵢ x` holds for infinitely many `i`) is equal to zero. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/BorelCantelli/Variant7289506ef12e4a348bf80f374d745304e1e553f6f9ce29fb0fb2524fca5aea75.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/BorelCantelli/Variant7289506ef12e4a348bf80f374d745304e1e553f6f9ce29fb0fb2524fca5aea75.lean#L78).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4b45d5561a479ef898ed951b1de23b8553caedef` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
