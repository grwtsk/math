## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a913e278e7880100586eda33fd37985c758d19eee0f0d7f7442060a895493ba8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 64–81.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance QuotientGroup.measurableSMul {G : Type*} [Group G] {Γ : Subgroup G} [MeasurableSpace G]
    [TopologicalSpace G] [IsTopologicalGroup G] [BorelSpace G] [BorelSpace (G ⧸ Γ)] :
    MeasurableSMul G (G ⧸ Γ) where
  measurable_const_smul g := (continuous_const_smul g).measurable
  measurable_smul_const _ := (continuous_id.smul continuous_const).measurable

end

section smulInvariantMeasure

variable {G : Type*} [Group G] [MeasurableSpace G] (ν : Measure G) {Γ : Subgroup G}
  {μ : Measure (G ⧸ Γ)}
  [QuotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage ν μ]

/-- Given a subgroup `Γ` of a topological group `G` with measure `ν`, and a measure 'μ' on the
  quotient `G ⧸ Γ` satisfying `QuotientMeasureEqMeasurePreimage`, the restriction
  of `ν` to a fundamental domain is measure-preserving with respect to `μ`. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Quotient/Variant49cd7d289ab94b6353b7dcc2a0e61608b6c3264236ea66e2ba83429e9104242d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Quotient/Variant49cd7d289ab94b6353b7dcc2a0e61608b6c3264236ea66e2ba83429e9104242d.lean#L64).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `83ad2fd7a27d480d662eafb193b8151209876bd6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
