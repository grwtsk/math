## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:d01bbbd3-87a6-3317-d600-91b294ba5ff5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 339–358.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- Given a quotient space `G ⧸ Γ` where `Γ` is `Countable`, and the restriction,
  `μ_𝓕`, of a right-invariant measure `μ` on `G` to a fundamental domain `𝓕`, a set
  in the quotient which has `μ_𝓕`-measure zero, also has measure zero under the
  folding of `μ` under the quotient. Note that, if `Γ` is infinite, then the folded map
  will take the value `∞` on any open set in the quotient! -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Quotient/Variantf7f31be0fa55334522c12cc0bc9e5347926ae7901dd8358ff76a2e59804e1196.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Quotient/Variantf7f31be0fa55334522c12cc0bc9e5347926ae7901dd8358ff76a2e59804e1196.lean#L339).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b71e0a3f773b720ae422a48d3a93e44211f79906` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
