## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:d9d49ea45629bd9f6efef8fc23a40bd412ec91ca79b1011a0c4b96f8039a7a29`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 418–425.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [hm : Fact (m ≤ m0)] [CompleteSpace F] [hp : Fact (1 ≤ p)] :
    CompleteSpace (lpMeasSubgroup F m p μ) := by
  rw [(lpMeasSubgroupToLpTrimIso F p μ hm.elim).completeSpace_iff]; infer_instance

-- For now just no-lint this; lean4's tree-based logging will make this easier to debug.
-- One possible change might be to generalize `𝕜` from `RCLike` to `NormedField`, as this
-- result may well hold there.
-- Porting note: removed @[nolint fails_quickly]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variantbde4f90b47722093353f4a492bfbbba85c7f90639c4073aa517b94daa6af94d1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variantbde4f90b47722093353f4a492bfbbba85c7f90639c4073aa517b94daa6af94d1.lean#L418).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b934ff951637017686cb7a8a3433df8f959ad205` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
