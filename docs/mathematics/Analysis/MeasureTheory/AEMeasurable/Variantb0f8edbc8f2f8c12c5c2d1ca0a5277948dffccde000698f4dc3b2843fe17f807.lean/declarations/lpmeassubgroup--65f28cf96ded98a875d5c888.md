## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:144974d7884d196ab6da4bd3ac5151aaea2f74b4a44faf75ff9d3dd56892d7db`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 76–87.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def lpMeasSubgroup (m : MeasurableSpace α) [MeasurableSpace α] (p : ℝ≥0∞) (μ : Measure α) :
    AddSubgroup (Lp F p μ) where
  carrier := {f : Lp F p μ | AEStronglyMeasurable[m] f μ}
  zero_mem' := ⟨(0 : α → F), @stronglyMeasurable_zero _ _ m _ _, Lp.coeFn_zero _ _ _⟩
  add_mem' {f g} hf hg := (hf.add hg).congr (Lp.coeFn_add f g).symm
  neg_mem' {f} hf := AEStronglyMeasurable.congr hf.neg (Lp.coeFn_neg f).symm

variable (𝕜)

/-- `lpMeas F 𝕜 m p μ` is the subspace of `Lp F p μ` containing functions `f` verifying
`AEStronglyMeasurable[m] f μ`, i.e. functions which are `μ`-a.e. equal to
an `m`-strongly measurable function. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variantb0f8edbc8f2f8c12c5c2d1ca0a5277948dffccde000698f4dc3b2843fe17f807.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variantb0f8edbc8f2f8c12c5c2d1ca0a5277948dffccde000698f4dc3b2843fe17f807.lean#L76).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `27cdf5d8f0d46b69f3378b6600cda1504f0ee976` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
