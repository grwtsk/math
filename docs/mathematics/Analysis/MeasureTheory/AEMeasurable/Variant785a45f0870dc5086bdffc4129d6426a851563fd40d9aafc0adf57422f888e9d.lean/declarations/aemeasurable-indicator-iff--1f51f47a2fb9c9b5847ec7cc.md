## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:fff11d6a-2ab5-3f99-00a5-579623cf8230`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 323–335.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem aemeasurable_indicator_iff {s} (hs : MeasurableSet s) :
    AEMeasurable (indicator s f) μ ↔ AEMeasurable f (μ.restrict s) := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    exact (h.mono_measure Measure.restrict_le_self).congr (indicator_ae_eq_restrict hs)
  · intro h
    refine ⟨indicator s (h.mk f), h.measurable_mk.indicator hs, ?_⟩
    have A : s.indicator f =ᵐ[μ.restrict s] s.indicator (AEMeasurable.mk f h) :=
      (indicator_ae_eq_restrict hs).trans (h.ae_eq_mk.trans <| (indicator_ae_eq_restrict hs).symm)
    have B : s.indicator f =ᵐ[μ.restrict sᶜ] s.indicator (AEMeasurable.mk f h) :=
      (indicator_ae_eq_restrict_compl hs).trans (indicator_ae_eq_restrict_compl hs).symm
    exact ae_of_ae_restrict_of_ae_restrict_compl _ A B

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variant785a45f0870dc5086bdffc4129d6426a851563fd40d9aafc0adf57422f888e9d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variant785a45f0870dc5086bdffc4129d6426a851563fd40d9aafc0adf57422f888e9d.lean#L323).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `46d74f74a00b9241d19a76deea1fe1efdfeff99a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
