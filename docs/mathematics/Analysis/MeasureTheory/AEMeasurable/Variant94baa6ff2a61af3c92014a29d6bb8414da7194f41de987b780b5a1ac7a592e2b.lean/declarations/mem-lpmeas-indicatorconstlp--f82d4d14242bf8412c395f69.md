## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:355c8844-f29c-69b4-1e2a-e6ed8444a934`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 233–251.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem mem_lpMeas_indicatorConstLp {m m0 : MeasurableSpace α} (hm : m ≤ m0) {μ : Measure α}
    {s : Set α} (hs : MeasurableSet[m] s) (hμs : μ s ≠ ∞) {c : F} :
    indicatorConstLp p (hm s hs) hμs c ∈ lpMeas F 𝕜 m p μ :=
  ⟨s.indicator fun _ : α => c, (@stronglyMeasurable_const _ _ m _ _).indicator hs,
    indicatorConstLp_coeFn⟩

section CompleteSubspace

/-! ## The subspace `lpMeas` is complete.

We define an `IsometryEquiv` between `lpMeasSubgroup` and the `Lp` space corresponding to the
measure `μ.trim hm`. As a consequence, the completeness of `Lp` implies completeness of
`lpMeasSubgroup` (and `lpMeas`). -/


variable {m m0 : MeasurableSpace α} {μ : Measure α}

/-- If `f` belongs to `lpMeasSubgroup F m p μ`, then the measurable function it is almost
everywhere equal to (given by `AEMeasurable.mk`) belongs to `ℒp` for the measure `μ.trim hm`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variant94baa6ff2a61af3c92014a29d6bb8414da7194f41de987b780b5a1ac7a592e2b.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variant94baa6ff2a61af3c92014a29d6bb8414da7194f41de987b780b5a1ac7a592e2b.lean#L233).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8c1a73eeeeee7c6e18848965fb9a2c9cf35d6972` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
