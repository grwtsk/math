## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1fdda009-e4bf-bba3-39b3-2645c2b28cd5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 62–83.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

    {mα : MeasurableSpace α} {_ : MeasurableSpace γ} {f : α → β} {μ : Measure γ} {g : γ → α}

section LpMeas

/-! ## The subset `lpMeas` of `Lp` functions a.e. measurable with respect to a sub-sigma-algebra -/


variable (F)

/-- `lpMeasSubgroup F m p μ` is the subspace of `Lp F p μ` containing functions `f` verifying
`AEStronglyMeasurable[m] f μ`, i.e. functions which are `μ`-a.e. equal to
an `m`-strongly measurable function. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variant9b52b72bb56b37cc06c13b2a7a6b24928dfbe6b784082fbfa34caad727c8166d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variant9b52b72bb56b37cc06c13b2a7a6b24928dfbe6b784082fbfa34caad727c8166d.lean#L62).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f397779b8f3f10c3541ee1f14058988ec8df78a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
