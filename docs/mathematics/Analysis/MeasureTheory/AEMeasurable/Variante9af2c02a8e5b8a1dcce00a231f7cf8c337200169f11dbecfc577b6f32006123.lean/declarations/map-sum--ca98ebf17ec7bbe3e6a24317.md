## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0ac5ff9b-a110-a19f-a037-046098a25c4c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 429–435.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma map_sum {ι : Type*} {m : ι → Measure α} {f : α → β} (hf : AEMeasurable f (Measure.sum m)) :
    Measure.map f (Measure.sum m) = Measure.sum (fun i ↦ Measure.map f (m i)) := by
  ext s hs
  rw [map_apply_of_aemeasurable hf hs, sum_apply₀ _ (hf.nullMeasurable hs), sum_apply _ hs]
  have M i : AEMeasurable f (m i) := hf.mono_measure (le_sum m i)
  simp_rw [map_apply_of_aemeasurable (M _) hs]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variante9af2c02a8e5b8a1dcce00a231f7cf8c337200169f11dbecfc577b6f32006123.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variante9af2c02a8e5b8a1dcce00a231f7cf8c337200169f11dbecfc577b6f32006123.lean#L429).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8624fba6d487c59f92c430cfa68bfd7c3bd1be2a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
