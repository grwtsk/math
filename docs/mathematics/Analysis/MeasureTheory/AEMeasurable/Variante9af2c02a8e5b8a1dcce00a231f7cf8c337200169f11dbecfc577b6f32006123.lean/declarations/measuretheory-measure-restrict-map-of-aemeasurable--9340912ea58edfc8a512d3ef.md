## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:da1f2812-5719-7126-cde4-bc76b1935ce0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 361–376.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem MeasureTheory.Measure.restrict_map_of_aemeasurable {f : α → δ} (hf : AEMeasurable f μ)
    {s : Set δ} (hs : MeasurableSet s) : (μ.map f).restrict s = (μ.restrict <| f ⁻¹' s).map f :=
  calc
    (μ.map f).restrict s = (μ.map (hf.mk f)).restrict s := by
      congr 1
      apply Measure.map_congr hf.ae_eq_mk
    _ = (μ.restrict <| hf.mk f ⁻¹' s).map (hf.mk f) := Measure.restrict_map hf.measurable_mk hs
    _ = (μ.restrict <| hf.mk f ⁻¹' s).map f :=
      (Measure.map_congr (ae_restrict_of_ae hf.ae_eq_mk.symm))
    _ = (μ.restrict <| f ⁻¹' s).map f := by
      apply congr_arg
      ext1 t ht
      simp only [ht, Measure.restrict_apply]
      apply measure_congr
      apply (EventuallyEq.refl _ _).inter (hf.ae_eq_mk.symm.preimage s)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variante9af2c02a8e5b8a1dcce00a231f7cf8c337200169f11dbecfc577b6f32006123.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/AEMeasurable/Variante9af2c02a8e5b8a1dcce00a231f7cf8c337200169f11dbecfc577b6f32006123.lean#L361).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8624fba6d487c59f92c430cfa68bfd7c3bd1be2a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
