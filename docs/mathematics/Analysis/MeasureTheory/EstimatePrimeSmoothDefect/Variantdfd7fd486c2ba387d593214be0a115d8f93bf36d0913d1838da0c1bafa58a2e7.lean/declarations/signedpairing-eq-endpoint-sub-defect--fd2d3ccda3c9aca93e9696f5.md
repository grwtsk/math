## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3c01b798-8bca-e2f9-3195-6aa57f05cdac`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 80–93.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem signedPairing_eq_endpoint_sub_defect
    (A : ℝ) (hA : 1 ≤ A) :
    signedPairing Realization.explicitSecondDerivative A =
      endpointMoment A - primeSmoothDefect A := by
  obtain ⟨hC, hzero⟩ :=
    CorrelationRegularity.correlation_certificate A hA
  have hdesc :=
    source_prime_power_descent
      Realization.explicitSecondDerivative A hA hC hzero
  rw [primePowerContribution_eq_closedPrimeMoment A hA] at hdesc
  unfold endpointMoment primeSmoothDefect smoothMoment
  linarith

/-- The only endpoint left by the descent is uniformly bounded. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/EstimatePrimeSmoothDefect/Variantdfd7fd486c2ba387d593214be0a115d8f93bf36d0913d1838da0c1bafa58a2e7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/EstimatePrimeSmoothDefect/Variantdfd7fd486c2ba387d593214be0a115d8f93bf36d0913d1838da0c1bafa58a2e7.lean#L80).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1ab7924ee82fdd0963213df13eb484d0ba46fa4c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
