## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:f1d9efee6e7410da8dbdbb52e6c977f8377b48a3c333ee471dccf562a1733162`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 206–215.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def CriticalPickupTail : Prop :=
  ∀ K : ℝ, 0 ≤ K → ∀ T : ℝ, 0 < T →
    Tendsto (fun n : ℕ =>
      coefficientProduct (fun j => supplierCoefficient K (T + (j : ℝ) * Real.log 2)) n *
        positiveEnvelope (T + (n : ℝ) * Real.log 2)) atTop (𝓝 0)

/-- The exact original initial pickup transform is exposed as a separate bridge.
`SupplierInitialTransform` discharges it in the downstream return module.
The half-plane here is a sub-half-plane of the paper's `Re z > 1/2`, sufficient
for the proved positive-Laplace continuation theorem. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SupplierOriginalAdapters/Variantc6d5475abf24dafcc0bff140ef23a798b70c1a366b83c028f05fa82eb5d9cd97.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SupplierOriginalAdapters/Variantc6d5475abf24dafcc0bff140ef23a798b70c1a366b83c028f05fa82eb5d9cd97.lean#L206).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `3c05c1608b14b0e522cd92f3ec160857acaf0264` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
