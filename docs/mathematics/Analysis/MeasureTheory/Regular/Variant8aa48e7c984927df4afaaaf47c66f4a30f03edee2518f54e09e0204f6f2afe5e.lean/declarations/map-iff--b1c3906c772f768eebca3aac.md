## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4bda9508-efed-fcdc-f7e2-9170bbec0301`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 698–714.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

  convert h.map f.symm
  rw [map_map f.symm.continuous.measurable f.continuous.measurable]
  simp

end InnerRegular

namespace InnerRegularCompactLTTop

variable [TopologicalSpace α]

/-- If `μ` is inner regular for finite measure sets with respect to compact sets,
then any measurable set of finite measure can be approximated by a
compact subset. See also `MeasurableSet.exists_lt_isCompact_of_ne_top`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Regular/Variant8aa48e7c984927df4afaaaf47c66f4a30f03edee2518f54e09e0204f6f2afe5e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Regular/Variant8aa48e7c984927df4afaaaf47c66f4a30f03edee2518f54e09e0204f6f2afe5e.lean#L698).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `f6e69fa585aaaf73abedd816c6839719a3c4b77a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
