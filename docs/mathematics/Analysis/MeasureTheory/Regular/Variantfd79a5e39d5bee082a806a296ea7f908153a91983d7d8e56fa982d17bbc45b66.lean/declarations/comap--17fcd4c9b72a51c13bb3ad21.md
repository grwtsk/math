## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:1bf436b8-77e8-733f-d3a9-9e1217037e0e`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 270–282.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
protected theorem comap {α β} [MeasurableSpace α] {mβ : MeasurableSpace β}
    {μ : Measure β} {pa qa : Set α → Prop} {pb qb : Set β → Prop}
    (H : InnerRegularWRT μ pb qb) {f : α → β} (hf : MeasurableEmbedding f)
    (hAB : ∀ U, qa U → qb (f '' U)) (hAB' : ∀ K ⊆ range f, pb K → pa (f ⁻¹' K)) :
    (μ.comap f).InnerRegularWRT pa qa := by
  intro U hU r hr
  rw [hf.comap_apply] at hr
  obtain ⟨K, hKU, hK, hμU⟩ := H (hAB U hU) r hr
  have hKrange := hKU.trans (image_subset_range _ _)
  refine ⟨f ⁻¹' K, ?_, hAB' K hKrange hK, ?_⟩
  · rw [← hf.injective.preimage_image U]; exact preimage_mono hKU
  · rwa [hf.comap_apply, image_preimage_eq_iff.mpr hKrange]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Regular/Variantfd79a5e39d5bee082a806a296ea7f908153a91983d7d8e56fa982d17bbc45b66.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Regular/Variantfd79a5e39d5bee082a806a296ea7f908153a91983d7d8e56fa982d17bbc45b66.lean#L270).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `64b864a9c22a66240a1889f478168dc8c650718d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
