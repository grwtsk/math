## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `class` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6a674a805ef98ccad61c30037fba5a1e3cc3f4be918d615c0a311b5c520a7286`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 316–324.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
class OuterRegular (μ : Measure α) : Prop where
  protected outerRegular :
    ∀ ⦃A : Set α⦄, MeasurableSet A → ∀ r > μ A, ∃ U, U ⊇ A ∧ IsOpen U ∧ μ U < r

/-- A measure `μ` is regular if
  - it is finite on all compact sets;
  - it is outer regular: `μ(A) = inf {μ(U) | A ⊆ U open}` for `A` measurable;
  - it is inner regular for open sets, using compact sets:
    `μ(U) = sup {μ(K) | K ⊆ U compact}` for `U` open. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Regular/Variantfd79a5e39d5bee082a806a296ea7f908153a91983d7d8e56fa982d17bbc45b66.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Regular/Variantfd79a5e39d5bee082a806a296ea7f908153a91983d7d8e56fa982d17bbc45b66.lean#L316).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `64b864a9c22a66240a1889f478168dc8c650718d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
