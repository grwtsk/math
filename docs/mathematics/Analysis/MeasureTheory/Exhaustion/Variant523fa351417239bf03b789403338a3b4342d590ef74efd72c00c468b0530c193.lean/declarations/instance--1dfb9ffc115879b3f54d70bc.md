## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6041d0230c69a260ef9fadf9d9be0185c7e2846ee4fe081056e60be5af9209bc`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 75–90.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : SigmaFinite (μ.restrict (μ.sigmaFiniteSetWRT ν)) := by
  rw [Measure.sigmaFiniteSetWRT]
  split_ifs with h
  · exact h.choose_spec.2.1
  · rw [Measure.restrict_empty]
    infer_instance

section IsFiniteMeasure

/-! We prove that the condition in the definition of `sigmaFiniteSetWRT` is true for finite
measures. Since every s-finite measure is absolutely continuous with respect to a finite measure,
the condition will then also be true for s-finite measures. -/

/-- Let `C` be the supremum of `ν s` over all measurable sets `s` such that `μ.restrict s` is
sigma-finite. `C` is finite since `ν` is a finite measure. Then there exists a measurable set `t`
with `μ.restrict t` sigma-finite such that `ν t ≥ C - 1/n`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Exhaustion/Variant523fa351417239bf03b789403338a3b4342d590ef74efd72c00c468b0530c193.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Exhaustion/Variant523fa351417239bf03b789403338a3b4342d590ef74efd72c00c468b0530c193.lean#L75).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5b3d651280d40645073ff1f346a34618418eb756` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
