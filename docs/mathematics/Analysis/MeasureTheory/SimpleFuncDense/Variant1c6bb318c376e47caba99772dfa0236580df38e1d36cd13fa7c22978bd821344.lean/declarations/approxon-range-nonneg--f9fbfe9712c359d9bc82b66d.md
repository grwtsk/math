## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f3ef9e6b-05e0-70df-89de-369bf8ab85b0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 135–145.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma approxOn_range_nonneg [Zero α] [Preorder α] {f : β → α}
    (hf : 0 ≤ f) {hfm : Measurable f} [SeparableSpace (range f ∪ {0} : Set α)] (n : ℕ) :
    0 ≤ approxOn f hfm (range f ∪ {0}) 0 (by simp) n := by
  have : range f ∪ {0} ⊆ Set.Ici 0 := by
    simp only [Set.union_singleton, Set.insert_subset_iff, Set.mem_Ici, le_refl, true_and]
    rintro - ⟨x, rfl⟩
    exact hf x
  exact fun _ ↦ this <| approxOn_mem ..

@[simp, nolint simpNF] -- Porting note: LHS doesn't simplify.
-- It seems the side conditions `hf` and `hg` are not applied by `simpNF`.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFuncDense/Variant1c6bb318c376e47caba99772dfa0236580df38e1d36cd13fa7c22978bd821344.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFuncDense/Variant1c6bb318c376e47caba99772dfa0236580df38e1d36cd13fa7c22978bd821344.lean#L135).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `46cc87531fe88f814da440b1301ccd6fc85df753` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
