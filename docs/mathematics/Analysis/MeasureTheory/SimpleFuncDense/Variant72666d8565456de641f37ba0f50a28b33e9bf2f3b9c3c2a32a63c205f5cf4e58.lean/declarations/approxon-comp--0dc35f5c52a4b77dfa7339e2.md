## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:679f69d5-7855-f28f-2447-9b1c0cb2409c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 154–158.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem approxOn_comp {γ : Type*} [MeasurableSpace γ] {f : β → α} (hf : Measurable f) {g : γ → β}
    (hg : Measurable g) {s : Set α} {y₀ : α} (h₀ : y₀ ∈ s) [SeparableSpace s] (n : ℕ) :
    approxOn (f ∘ g) (hf.comp hg) s y₀ h₀ n = (approxOn f hf s y₀ h₀ n).comp g hg :=
  rfl

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFuncDense/Variant72666d8565456de641f37ba0f50a28b33e9bf2f3b9c3c2a32a63c205f5cf4e58.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFuncDense/Variant72666d8565456de641f37ba0f50a28b33e9bf2f3b9c3c2a32a63c205f5cf4e58.lean#L154).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e823c1faf09ab6d45d89ca24eb191729c0604f43` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
