## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0344e9d0-a0a7-70a2-1cdf-f5213241ab98`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 108–120.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem Measure.MeasureDense.completion (h𝒜 : μ.MeasureDense 𝒜) : μ.completion.MeasureDense 𝒜 where
  measurable s hs := (h𝒜.measurable s hs).nullMeasurableSet
  approx s hs hμs ε ε_pos := by
    obtain ⟨t, ht, hμst⟩ :=
      h𝒜.approx (toMeasurable μ s) (measurableSet_toMeasurable μ s) (by simpa) ε ε_pos
    refine ⟨t, ht, ?_⟩
    convert hμst using 1

/-- If a family of sets `𝒜` is measure-dense in `X`, then any measurable set with finite measure
can be approximated by sets in `𝒜` with finite measure. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SeparableMeasure/Variant4120701c67be7a4cee64273daf249fee3ee2f5a227f63ddc2c9602e7250bf87e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SeparableMeasure/Variant4120701c67be7a4cee64273daf249fee3ee2f5a227f63ddc2c9602e7250bf87e.lean#L108).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `074ad086f166d02a09dce58d5fee60fd0ce3f53b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
