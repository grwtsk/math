## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:dcd6273e-bac4-51b6-2a81-07735a2982f8`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 54–62.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem bochnerVector_norm_le (f : FullH) :
    ‖bochnerVector f‖ ≤ (∫ a : ℝ, ‖fixedKernel a‖) * ‖f‖ := by
  calc
    _ ≤ ∫ a : ℝ, ‖(fixedKernel a : ℂ) • fullShift a f‖ := norm_integral_le_integral_norm _
    _ = _ := by
      simp only [norm_smul, Complex.norm_real, LinearIsometry.norm_map, integral_mul_const]

end
end OperatorScoutScratch

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/OperatorScout/Variante5d33a1ef24e870ceab73a09578af4df00277330de12c8d8ef14da5a47472731.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/OperatorScout/Variante5d33a1ef24e870ceab73a09578af4df00277330de12c8d8ef14da5a47472731.lean#L54).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e69671caf7367c1dadebdfd8264c0771a58cf50e` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
