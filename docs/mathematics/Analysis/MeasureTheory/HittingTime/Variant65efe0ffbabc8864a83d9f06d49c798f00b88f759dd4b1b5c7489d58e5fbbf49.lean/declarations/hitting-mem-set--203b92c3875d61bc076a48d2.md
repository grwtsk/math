## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:70fdcbcf-e70b-7904-6d23-70331a5f3423`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 131–141.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem hitting_mem_set [IsWellOrder ι (· < ·)] {m : ι} (h_exists : ∃ j ∈ Set.Icc n m, u j ω ∈ s) :
    u (hitting u s n m ω) ω ∈ s := by
  simp_rw [hitting, if_pos h_exists]
  have h_nonempty : (Set.Icc n m ∩ {i : ι | u i ω ∈ s}).Nonempty := by
    obtain ⟨k, hk₁, hk₂⟩ := h_exists
    exact ⟨k, Set.mem_inter hk₁ hk₂⟩
  have h_mem := csInf_mem h_nonempty
  rw [Set.mem_inter_iff] at h_mem
  exact h_mem.2

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/HittingTime/Variant65efe0ffbabc8864a83d9f06d49c798f00b88f759dd4b1b5c7489d58e5fbbf49.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/HittingTime/Variant65efe0ffbabc8864a83d9f06d49c798f00b88f759dd4b1b5c7489d58e5fbbf49.lean#L131).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `be0ad7517a91b7707a098018c45f3b548879b219` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
