## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:394092bd146991198d1566d8bc98ba5deeffbf8311e085c53f82ce9a08ae1971`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 158–180.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-! ### Disintegration of kernels on standard Borel spaces

Since every standard Borel space embeds measurably into `ℝ`, we can generalize a disintegration
property on `ℝ` to all these spaces. -/

open Classical in
/-- Auxiliary definition for `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.condKernel`.
A Borel space `Ω` embeds measurably into `ℝ` (with embedding `e`), hence we can get a `Kernel α Ω`
from a `Kernel α ℝ` by taking the comap by `e`.
Here we take the comap of a modification of `η : Kernel α ℝ`, useful when `η a` is a probability
measure with all its mass on `range e` almost everywhere with respect to some measure and we want to
ensure that the comap is a Markov kernel.
We thus take the comap by `e` of a kernel defined piecewise: `η` when
`η a (range (embeddingReal Ω))ᶜ = 0`, and an arbitrary deterministic kernel otherwise. -/

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/StandardBorel/Variant6cf6290e0c5867d393367b47f2bdf98c499a1e2e30add73c21eb4deb316cdf73.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/StandardBorel/Variant6cf6290e0c5867d393367b47f2bdf98c499a1e2e30add73c21eb4deb316cdf73.lean#L158).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `c447608fc4db3467930c248d2790b9f48795cf7d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
