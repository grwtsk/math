## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:475092dedd83aad1cc115b0421e0aa257b05226f111e502a2b24ac2dfa02f35f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–174.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance [∀ n, IsMarkovKernel (κ n)] (a b : ℕ) :
    IsMarkovKernel (partialTraj κ a b) := by
  obtain hab | hba := le_total a b
  · induction b, hab using Nat.le_induction with
    | base => rw [partialTraj_self]; infer_instance
    | succ k hak =>
      rw [partialTraj_succ_of_le hak]
      have := IsMarkovKernel.map (κ k) (piSingleton k).measurable
      exact IsMarkovKernel.map _ measurable_IicProdIoc
  · rw [partialTraj_le hba]; infer_instance

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/PartialTraj/Variant5c190b08f47f26e76b8092bc25f5fb0cf15dfdf21d02673ce6725b570dacec6f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/PartialTraj/Variant5c190b08f47f26e76b8092bc25f5fb0cf15dfdf21d02673ce6725b570dacec6f.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8d100aa339def3bd261e1aba6660d7bf711a26d6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
