## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:2d8c1926-828f-c8ba-f87c-95a87f005bb2`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 255–264.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma map_partialTraj_succ_self (a : ℕ) :
    (partialTraj κ a (a + 1)).map (fun x ↦ x ⟨a + 1, mem_Iic.2 le_rfl⟩) = κ a := by
  have hp : (fun x : Π n : Iic (a + 1), X n ↦ x ⟨a + 1, mem_Iic.2 le_rfl⟩) ∘ IicProdIoc a (a + 1) =
      (piSingleton a).symm ∘ Prod.snd := by
    ext
    simp [_root_.IicProdIoc, piSingleton]
  rw [partialTraj_succ_self, ← map_comp_right _ (by fun_prop) (by fun_prop), hp,
    map_comp_right _ (by fun_prop) (by fun_prop), ← snd_eq, snd_prod,
    ← map_comp_right _ (by fun_prop) (by fun_prop), symm_comp_self, map_id]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/PartialTraj/Variant44bb42f6949896a96881e9b8bc690bbc72a6526697de9b63769cba8f52d4cadd.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/PartialTraj/Variant44bb42f6949896a96881e9b8bc690bbc72a6526697de9b63769cba8f52d4cadd.lean#L255).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e4ee8f1d8ef16e1185f87af376704ea9a33fcd71` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
