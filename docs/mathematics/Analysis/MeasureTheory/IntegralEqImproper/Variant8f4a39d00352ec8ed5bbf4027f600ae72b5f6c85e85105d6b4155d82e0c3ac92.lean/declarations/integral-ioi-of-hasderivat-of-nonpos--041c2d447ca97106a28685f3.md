## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:8537a47b-2164-87da-c7bd-dda67172a8b5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 855–863.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem integral_Ioi_of_hasDerivAt_of_nonpos (hcont : ContinuousWithinAt g (Ici a) a)
    (hderiv : ∀ x ∈ Ioi a, HasDerivAt g (g' x) x) (g'neg : ∀ x ∈ Ioi a, g' x ≤ 0)
    (hg : Tendsto g atTop (𝓝 l)) : ∫ x in Ioi a, g' x = l - g a :=
  integral_Ioi_of_hasDerivAt_of_tendsto hcont hderiv
    (integrableOn_Ioi_deriv_of_nonpos hcont hderiv g'neg hg) hg

/-- When a function has a limit at infinity `l`, and its derivative is nonpositive, then the
integral of the derivative on `(a, +∞)` is `l - g a` (and the derivative is integrable, see
`integrable_on_Ioi_deriv_of_nonneg'`). Version assuming differentiability on `[a, +∞)`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/IntegralEqImproper/Variant8f4a39d00352ec8ed5bbf4027f600ae72b5f6c85e85105d6b4155d82e0c3ac92.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/IntegralEqImproper/Variant8f4a39d00352ec8ed5bbf4027f600ae72b5f6c85e85105d6b4155d82e0c3ac92.lean#L855).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `a9cd29cd83cffc82b346ff6c62d50ebd2c26c519` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
