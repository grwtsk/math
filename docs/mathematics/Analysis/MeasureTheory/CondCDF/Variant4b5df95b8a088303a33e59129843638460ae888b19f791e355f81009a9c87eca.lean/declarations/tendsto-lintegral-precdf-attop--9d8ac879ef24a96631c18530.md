## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:944969aa-b3f4-3a89-e408-c90b51b0d39c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 368–374.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem tendsto_lintegral_preCdf_atTop (ρ : Measure (α × ℝ)) [IsFiniteMeasure ρ] :
    Tendsto (fun r => ∫⁻ a, preCdf ρ r a ∂ρ.fst) atTop (𝓝 (ρ univ)) := by
  convert ρ.tendsto_IicSnd_atTop MeasurableSet.univ
  · rw [← set_lintegral_univ, set_lintegral_preCdf_fst ρ _ MeasurableSet.univ]
  · exact Measure.fst_univ.symm
#align probability_theory.tendsto_lintegral_pre_cdf_at_top ProbabilityTheory.tendsto_lintegral_preCdf_atTop

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CondCDF/Variant4b5df95b8a088303a33e59129843638460ae888b19f791e355f81009a9c87eca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/CondCdf/Variant4b5df95b8a088303a33e59129843638460ae888b19f791e355f81009a9c87eca.lean#L368).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8ff22f63535d2a22bb2c37e21aea83df0babac79` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
