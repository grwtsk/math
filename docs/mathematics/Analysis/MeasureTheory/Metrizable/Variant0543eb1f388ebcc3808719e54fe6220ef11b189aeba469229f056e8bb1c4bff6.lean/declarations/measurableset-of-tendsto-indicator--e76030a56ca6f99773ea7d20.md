## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f00be6cd-18ab-b854-e374-5886943349b4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 147–155.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma measurableSet_of_tendsto_indicator [NeBot L] (As_mble : ∀ i, MeasurableSet (As i))
    (h_lim : ∀ x, ∀ᶠ i in L, x ∈ As i ↔ x ∈ A) :
    MeasurableSet A := by
  simp_rw [← measurable_indicator_const_iff (1 : ℝ≥0∞)] at As_mble ⊢

    ((tendsto_indicator_const_iff_forall_eventually L (1 : ℝ≥0∞)).mpr h_lim)

/-- If the indicator functions of a.e.-measurable sets `Aᵢ` converge a.e. to the indicator function
of a set `A` along a nontrivial countably generated filter, then `A` is also a.e.-measurable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Metrizable/Variant0543eb1f388ebcc3808719e54fe6220ef11b189aeba469229f056e8bb1c4bff6.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Metrizable/Variant0543eb1f388ebcc3808719e54fe6220ef11b189aeba469229f056e8bb1c4bff6.lean#L147).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `09e7aeba209eb07846383f5bf8f8cbf6c85fd7a1` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
