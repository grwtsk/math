## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0ae28c22-a760-2ca1-ee6d-6d5d88abca16`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 800–824.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

theorem isClopenable_iff_measurableSet : IsClopenable s ↔ MeasurableSet s := by
  -- we already know that a measurable set is clopenable. Conversely, assume that `s` is clopenable.
  refine' ⟨fun hs => _, fun hs => hs.isClopenable⟩
  -- consider a finer topology `t'` in which `s` is open and closed.
  obtain ⟨t', t't, t'_polish, s_closed, _⟩ :
    ∃ t' : TopologicalSpace γ, t' ≤ tγ ∧ @PolishSpace γ t' ∧ IsClosed[t'] s ∧ IsOpen[t'] s := hs
  -- the identity is continuous from `t'` to `tγ`.
  have C : @Continuous γ γ t' tγ id := continuous_id_of_le t't
  -- therefore, it is also a measurable embedding, by the Lusin-Souslin theorem
  have E :=
    @Continuous.measurableEmbedding γ t' t'_polish (@borel γ t')

      γ tγ (@PolishSpace.t2Space γ tγ _) _ _ id C injective_id
  -- the set `s` is measurable for `t'` as it is closed.
  have M : @MeasurableSet γ (@borel γ t') s :=

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Polish/Variant236ac133d1f412f8ac45c49482790b37dec0707551c509bc4087521c36163c2c.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Polish/Variant236ac133d1f412f8ac45c49482790b37dec0707551c509bc4087521c36163c2c.lean#L800).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `13d22689357e296d272a36ec51174a0849e49fa9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
