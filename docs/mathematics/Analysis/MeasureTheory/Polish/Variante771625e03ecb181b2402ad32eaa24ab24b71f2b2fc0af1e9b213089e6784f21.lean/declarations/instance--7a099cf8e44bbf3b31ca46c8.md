## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:a2c6db45a69c05b0aab25d1fb4edf6438f8fb53be40a5d621677dc7ad0b8cc6f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 849–862.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance (priority := 50) polish_of_countable [h : Countable α] [DiscreteTopology α] :
    PolishSpace α := by
  obtain ⟨f, hf⟩ := h.exists_injective_nat
  have : ClosedEmbedding f := by
    apply closedEmbedding_of_continuous_injective_closed continuous_of_discreteTopology hf
    exact fun t _ => isClosed_discrete _
  exact this.polishSpace
#align polish_of_countable polish_of_countable

namespace PolishSpace

/- Porting note: This is to avoid a loop in TC inference. When ported to Lean 4, this will not
be necessary, and `secondCountable_of_polish` should probably
just be added as an instance soon after the definition of `PolishSpace`.-/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Polish/Variante771625e03ecb181b2402ad32eaa24ab24b71f2b2fc0af1e9b213089e6784f21.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Polish/Variante771625e03ecb181b2402ad32eaa24ab24b71f2b2fc0af1e9b213089e6784f21.lean#L849).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `36445ca6cf962ffb3c79fae649fc48eb7ace49ee` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
