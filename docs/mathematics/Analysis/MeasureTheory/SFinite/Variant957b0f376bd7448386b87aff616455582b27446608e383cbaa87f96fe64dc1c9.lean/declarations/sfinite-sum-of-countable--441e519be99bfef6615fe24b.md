## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:13a84fc9-19e1-4c83-416c-f774bbf5294f`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 64–73.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma sfinite_sum_of_countable [Countable ι]
    (m : ι → Measure α) [∀ n, IsFiniteMeasure (m n)] : SFinite (Measure.sum m) := by
  obtain ⟨f, hf⟩ : ∃ f : ι → ℕ, Function.Injective f := Countable.exists_injective_nat ι
  refine ⟨_, fun n ↦ ?_, (sum_extend_zero hf m).symm⟩
  rcases em (n ∈ range f) with ⟨i, rfl⟩ | hn

  · rw [Function.extend_apply' _ _ _ hn, Pi.zero_apply]
    infer_instance

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SFinite/Variant957b0f376bd7448386b87aff616455582b27446608e383cbaa87f96fe64dc1c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SFinite/Variant957b0f376bd7448386b87aff616455582b27446608e383cbaa87f96fe64dc1c9.lean#L64).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `da99368a7a1578c2cc1fd7abdef79c9dc185e5f7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
