## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:0df40d0b790e0a4511b2c867dc6a0a77d03c3b690cf28524158113e2238ba05a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 117–130.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def Measure.toFiniteSpanningSetsIn (μ : Measure α) [h : SigmaFinite μ] :
    μ.FiniteSpanningSetsIn { s | MeasurableSet s } where
  set n := toMeasurable μ (h.out.some.set n)
  set_mem _ := measurableSet_toMeasurable _ _
  finite n := by
    rw [measure_toMeasurable]
    exact h.out.some.finite n
  spanning := eq_univ_of_subset (iUnion_mono fun _ => subset_toMeasurable _ _) h.out.some.spanning

/-- A noncomputable way to get a monotone collection of sets that span `univ` and have finite
  measure using `Classical.choose`. This definition satisfies monotonicity in addition to all other
  properties in `SigmaFinite`. -/
-- Note: `Set` has no computational content, but Lean still attempts to compile it.
-- See https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/14084.
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SFinite/Variant957b0f376bd7448386b87aff616455582b27446608e383cbaa87f96fe64dc1c9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SFinite/Variant957b0f376bd7448386b87aff616455582b27446608e383cbaa87f96fe64dc1c9.lean#L117).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `da99368a7a1578c2cc1fd7abdef79c9dc185e5f7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
