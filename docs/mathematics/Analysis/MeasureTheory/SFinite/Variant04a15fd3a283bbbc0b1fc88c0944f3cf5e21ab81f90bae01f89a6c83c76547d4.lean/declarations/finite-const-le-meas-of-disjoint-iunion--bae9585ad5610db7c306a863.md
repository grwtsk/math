## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:c5aa21cb-ef76-b56c-e6bf-b7c306a9ab2d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 230–238.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem finite_const_le_meas_of_disjoint_iUnion {ι : Type*} [MeasurableSpace α] (μ : Measure α)
    {ε : ℝ≥0∞} (ε_pos : 0 < ε) {As : ι → Set α} (As_mble : ∀ i : ι, MeasurableSet (As i))
    (As_disj : Pairwise (Disjoint on As)) (Union_As_finite : μ (⋃ i, As i) ≠ ∞) :
    Set.Finite { i : ι | ε ≤ μ (As i) } :=
  finite_const_le_meas_of_disjoint_iUnion₀ μ ε_pos (fun i ↦ (As_mble i).nullMeasurableSet)
    (fun _ _ h ↦ Disjoint.aedisjoint (As_disj h)) Union_As_finite

/-- If all elements of an infinite set have measure uniformly separated from zero,
then the set has infinite measure. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SFinite/Variant04a15fd3a283bbbc0b1fc88c0944f3cf5e21ab81f90bae01f89a6c83c76547d4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SFinite/Variant04a15fd3a283bbbc0b1fc88c0944f3cf5e21ab81f90bae01f89a6c83c76547d4.lean#L230).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `853877bcadd246cff80f7cda3a45128b777b6388` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
