## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:b5e13a95-585b-bf68-ecef-3344c24e47ae`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 551–571.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem sigmaFinite_bot_iff (μ : @Measure α ⊥) : SigmaFinite μ ↔ IsFiniteMeasure μ := by
  refine
    ⟨fun h => ⟨?_⟩, fun h => by
      haveI := h
      infer_instance⟩
  haveI : SigmaFinite μ := h
  let s := spanningSets μ
  have hs_univ : ⋃ i, s i = Set.univ := iUnion_spanningSets μ
  have hs_meas : ∀ i, MeasurableSet[⊥] (s i) := measurableSet_spanningSets μ
  simp_rw [MeasurableSpace.measurableSet_bot_iff] at hs_meas
  by_cases h_univ_empty : (Set.univ : Set α) = ∅
  · rw [h_univ_empty, measure_empty]

  obtain ⟨i, hsi⟩ : ∃ i, s i = Set.univ := by
    by_contra! h_not_univ
    have h_empty : ∀ i, s i = ∅ := by simpa [h_not_univ] using hs_meas
    simp only [h_empty, iUnion_empty] at hs_univ
    exact h_univ_empty hs_univ.symm
  rw [← hsi]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SFinite/Variant04a15fd3a283bbbc0b1fc88c0944f3cf5e21ab81f90bae01f89a6c83c76547d4.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SFinite/Variant04a15fd3a283bbbc0b1fc88c0944f3cf5e21ab81f90bae01f89a6c83c76547d4.lean#L551).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `853877bcadd246cff80f7cda3a45128b777b6388` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
