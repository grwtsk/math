## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:4c874833-a2d2-06e2-d174-df3755e4dea9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 590–596.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem smul_toSimpleFunc (k : 𝕜) (f : Lp.simpleFunc E p μ) :
    toSimpleFunc (k • f) =ᵐ[μ] k • ⇑(toSimpleFunc f) := by
  filter_upwards [toSimpleFunc_eq_toFun (k • f), toSimpleFunc_eq_toFun f,
    Lp.coeFn_smul k (f : Lp E p μ)] with _
  simp only [Pi.smul_apply, coe_smul]
  repeat intro h; rw [h]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFuncDenseLp/Variant0f887209858333703963bb02ef2de5acb678d5d8960d78f45bf90387d858097f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFuncDenseLp/Variant0f887209858333703963bb02ef2de5acb678d5d8960d78f45bf90387d858097f.lean#L590).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `bc237f045196c891c518d440ecfe10e5273ff39c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
