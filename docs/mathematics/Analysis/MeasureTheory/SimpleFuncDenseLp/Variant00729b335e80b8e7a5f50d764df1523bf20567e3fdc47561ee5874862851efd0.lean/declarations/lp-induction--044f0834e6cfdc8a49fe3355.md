## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:956ee4e0-b2c4-00fb-3459-893ff45b14a3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 817–841.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

/-- To prove something for an arbitrary `MemLp` function in a second countable
Borel normed group, it suffices to show that
* the property holds for (multiples of) characteristic functions;
* is closed under addition;
* the set of functions in the `Lᵖ` space for which the property holds is closed.
* the property is closed under the almost-everywhere equal relation.

It is possible to make the hypotheses in the induction steps a bit stronger, and such conditions
can be added once we need them (for example in `h_add` it is only necessary to consider the sum of
a simple function with a multiple of a characteristic function and that the intersection
of their images is a subset of `{0}`).

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFuncDenseLp/Variant00729b335e80b8e7a5f50d764df1523bf20567e3fdc47561ee5874862851efd0.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFuncDenseLp/Variant00729b335e80b8e7a5f50d764df1523bf20567e3fdc47561ee5874862851efd0.lean#L817).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b8c42bc3f0aa0818639c71056518a58cf5f53418` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
