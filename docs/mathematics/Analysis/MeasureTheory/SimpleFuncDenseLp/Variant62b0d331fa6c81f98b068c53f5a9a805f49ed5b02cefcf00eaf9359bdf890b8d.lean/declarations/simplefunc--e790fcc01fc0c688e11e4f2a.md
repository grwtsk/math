## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8ae40690d0b27444c509372c95f1c7526737d2850aad268dd2d697daed6fe14b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 453–477.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def simpleFunc : AddSubgroup (Lp E p μ) where
  carrier := { f : Lp E p μ | ∃ s : α →ₛ E, (AEEqFun.mk s s.aestronglyMeasurable : α →ₘ[μ] E) = f }
  zero_mem' := ⟨0, rfl⟩
  add_mem' := by
    rintro f g ⟨s, hs⟩ ⟨t, ht⟩
    use s + t
    simp only [← hs, ← ht, AEEqFun.mk_add_mk, AddSubgroup.coe_add, AEEqFun.mk_eq_mk,
      SimpleFunc.coe_add]
  neg_mem' := by
    rintro f ⟨s, hs⟩
    use -s
    simp only [← hs, AEEqFun.neg_mk, SimpleFunc.coe_neg, AEEqFun.mk_eq_mk, AddSubgroup.coe_neg]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFuncDenseLp/Variant62b0d331fa6c81f98b068c53f5a9a805f49ed5b02cefcf00eaf9359bdf890b8d.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/SimpleFuncDenseLp/Variant62b0d331fa6c81f98b068c53f5a9a805f49ed5b02cefcf00eaf9359bdf890b8d.lean#L453).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5c77dc9c371fa99d42ebbb15160925d62de4b858` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
