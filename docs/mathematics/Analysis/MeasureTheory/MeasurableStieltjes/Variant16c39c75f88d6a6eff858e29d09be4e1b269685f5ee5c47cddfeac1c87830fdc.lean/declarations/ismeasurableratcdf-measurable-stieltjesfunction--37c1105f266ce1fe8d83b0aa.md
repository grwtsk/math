## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5d6c1c41-f32f-8036-8f9d-02ca579b370d`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 403–412.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma IsMeasurableRatCDF.measurable_stieltjesFunction (x : ℝ) :
    Measurable fun a ↦ hf.stieltjesFunction a x := by
  have : (fun a ↦ hf.stieltjesFunction a x) = fun a ↦ ⨅ r : { r' : ℚ // x < r' }, f a ↑r := by
    ext1 a
    rw [← StieltjesFunction.iInf_rat_gt_eq]
    congr with q
    rw [stieltjesFunction_eq]
  rw [this]
  exact .iInf (fun q ↦ hf.measurable.eval)

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasurableStieltjes/Variant16c39c75f88d6a6eff858e29d09be4e1b269685f5ee5c47cddfeac1c87830fdc.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/MeasurableStieltjes/Variant16c39c75f88d6a6eff858e29d09be4e1b269685f5ee5c47cddfeac1c87830fdc.lean#L403).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `4e73bd687c636dd9b9bed90056a339a400e2080d` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
