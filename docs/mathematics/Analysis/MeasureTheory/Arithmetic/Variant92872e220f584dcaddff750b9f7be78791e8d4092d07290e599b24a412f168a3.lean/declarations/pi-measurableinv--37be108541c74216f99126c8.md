## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:179aa151ca3f7574d43032c87acdf8a594243993f177c778002c58593d2c3ac4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 493–499.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Pi.measurableInv {ι : Type*} {α : ι → Type*} [∀ i, Inv (α i)]
    [∀ i, MeasurableSpace (α i)] [∀ i, MeasurableInv (α i)] : MeasurableInv (∀ i, α i) :=
  ⟨measurable_pi_iff.mpr fun i => (measurable_pi_apply i).inv⟩
#align pi.has_measurable_inv Pi.measurableInv
#align pi.has_measurable_neg Pi.measurableNeg

@[to_additive]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Arithmetic/Variant92872e220f584dcaddff750b9f7be78791e8d4092d07290e599b24a412f168a3.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Arithmetic/Variant92872e220f584dcaddff750b9f7be78791e8d4092d07290e599b24a412f168a3.lean#L493).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e7cd1cccdb7e570b3d7e87fba6e69fe4f2473ebc` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
