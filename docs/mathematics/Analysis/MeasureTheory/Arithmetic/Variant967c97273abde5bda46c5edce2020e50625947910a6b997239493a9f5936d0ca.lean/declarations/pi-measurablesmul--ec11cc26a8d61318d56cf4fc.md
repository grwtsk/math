## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:cae097e483eaa3719a7d669990b589961c93f000b3f2c8fc57bacf52b0a941f7`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 636–641.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Pi.measurableSMul {ι : Type*} {α : ι → Type*} [∀ i, SMul M (α i)]
    [∀ i, MeasurableSpace (α i)] [∀ i, MeasurableSMul M (α i)] :
    MeasurableSMul M (∀ i, α i) where
  measurable_smul_const _ := measurable_pi_iff.2 fun _ ↦ measurable_smul_const _

/-- `AddMonoid.SMul` is measurable. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Arithmetic/Variant967c97273abde5bda46c5edce2020e50625947910a6b997239493a9f5936d0ca.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Arithmetic/Variant967c97273abde5bda46c5edce2020e50625947910a6b997239493a9f5936d0ca.lean#L636).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5d6578ea38ce5370416650f411568720d058e5d6` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
