## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:6a67c2584af32b38e3974c17db40539ba837f086a58c7d7856196318a90af54a`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 378–384.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance Pi.measurableDiv₂ {ι : Type*} {α : ι → Type*} [∀ i, Div (α i)]
    [∀ i, MeasurableSpace (α i)] [∀ i, MeasurableDiv₂ (α i)] : MeasurableDiv₂ (∀ i, α i) :=
  ⟨measurable_pi_iff.mpr fun _ => measurable_fst.eval.div measurable_snd.eval⟩
#align pi.has_measurable_div₂ Pi.measurableDiv₂
#align pi.has_measurable_sub₂ Pi.measurableSub₂

@[measurability]
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Arithmetic/Variantd1d57fb38678256a746bc03b3e168c611701abb1d27f227df764e4be8ae410ea.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Arithmetic/Variantd1d57fb38678256a746bc03b3e168c611701abb1d27f227df764e4be8ae410ea.lean#L378).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `cddcbe6455265d622ffddd416b8ae2d50a94a71a` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
