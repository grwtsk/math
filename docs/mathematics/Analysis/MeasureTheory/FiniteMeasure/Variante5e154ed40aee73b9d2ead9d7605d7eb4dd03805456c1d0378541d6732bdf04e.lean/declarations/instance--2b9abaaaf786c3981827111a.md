## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:743e3506421dedd7cccda87c8c83f8c67b7242c870efcd39d4ee99dfb1523ac3`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 781–796.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean

  refine ⟨continuous_iff_continuousAt.2 (fun p ↦ ?_)⟩
  apply tendsto_iff_forall_integral_tendsto.2 (fun g ↦ ?_)
  have A : Tendsto (fun (i : ℝ≥0 × FiniteMeasure Ω) ↦ i.1) (𝓝 p) (𝓝 (p.1)) := by
    rw [nhds_prod_eq]
    exact tendsto_fst
  have B : Tendsto (fun (i : ℝ≥0 × FiniteMeasure Ω) ↦ ∫ x, g x ∂i.2) (𝓝 p)
      (𝓝 (∫ x, g x ∂p.2)) := by

/-- The characterization of weak convergence of finite measures by the condition that the
integrals of every continuous bounded nonnegative function are continuous. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/FiniteMeasure/Variante5e154ed40aee73b9d2ead9d7605d7eb4dd03805456c1d0378541d6732bdf04e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/FiniteMeasure/Variante5e154ed40aee73b9d2ead9d7605d7eb4dd03805456c1d0378541d6732bdf04e.lean#L781).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8b8d3b802caeee3f409048a9044cc77e96b73f4f` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
