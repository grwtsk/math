## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `lemma` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:0fb896ff-68c3-ebc4-96d7-1324db050c05`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 92–101.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
lemma measurable_IicProdIoc {m n : ι} : Measurable (IicProdIoc (X := X) m n) := by
  refine .of_eval (fun i ↦ ?_)
  by_cases h : i ≤ m
  · simpa [IicProdIoc, h] using measurable_fst.eval
  · simpa [IicProdIoc, h] using measurable_snd.eval

namespace MeasurableEquiv

/-- Gluing `Iic a` and `Ioc a b` into `Iic b`. This version requires `a ≤ b` to get a measurable
equivalence. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../../verification/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Maps/Variant7bbae54de41d69f2afbdab9016d85a2bf06983ce56c4b68eb8b995ee73a29647.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MeasureTheory/Maps/Variant7bbae54de41d69f2afbdab9016d85a2bf06983ce56c4b68eb8b995ee73a29647.lean#L92).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6ad570c3db434b0cb1d0c167fe77923cde195a56` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
