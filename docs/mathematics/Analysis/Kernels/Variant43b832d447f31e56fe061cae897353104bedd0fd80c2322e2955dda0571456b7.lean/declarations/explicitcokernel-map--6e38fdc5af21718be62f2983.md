## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:bd95401106634d678d69638b8e9e3cabc7d8421f3a80ccc14485c84c448ed43c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 316–321.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def explicitCokernel.map {A B C D : SemiNormedGrp.{u}}
    {fab : A ⟶ B} {fbd : B ⟶ D} {fac : A ⟶ C} {fcd : C ⟶ D} (h : fab ≫ fbd = fac ≫ fcd) :
    explicitCokernel fab ⟶ explicitCokernel fcd :=
  @explicitCokernelDesc _ _ _ fab (fbd ≫ explicitCokernelπ _) <| by simp [reassoc_of% h]

/-- A special case of `CategoryTheory.Limits.cokernel.map_desc` adapted to `explicitCokernel`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Kernels/Variant43b832d447f31e56fe061cae897353104bedd0fd80c2322e2955dda0571456b7.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Kernels/Variant43b832d447f31e56fe061cae897353104bedd0fd80c2322e2955dda0571456b7.lean#L316).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `152ba3a3d004a66207acb714fc84ca85797ea536` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
