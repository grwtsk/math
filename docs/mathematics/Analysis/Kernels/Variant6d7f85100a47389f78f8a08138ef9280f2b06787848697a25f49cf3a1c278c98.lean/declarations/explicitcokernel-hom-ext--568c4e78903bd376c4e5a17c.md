## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:310e2773-acb7-5f1d-0d49-b9c7b7572714`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 244–253.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem explicitCokernel_hom_ext {X Y Z : SemiNormedGrp.{u}} {f : X ⟶ Y}
    (e₁ e₂ : explicitCokernel f ⟶ Z) (h : explicitCokernelπ f ≫ e₁ = explicitCokernelπ f ≫ e₂) :
    e₁ = e₂ := by
  let g : Y ⟶ Z := explicitCokernelπ f ≫ e₂
  have w : f ≫ g = 0 := by simp [g]
  have : e₂ = explicitCokernelDesc w := by apply explicitCokernelDesc_unique; rfl
  rw [this]
  apply explicitCokernelDesc_unique
  exact h

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Kernels/Variant6d7f85100a47389f78f8a08138ef9280f2b06787848697a25f49cf3a1c278c98.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Kernels/Variant6d7f85100a47389f78f8a08138ef9280f2b06787848697a25f49cf3a1c278c98.lean#L244).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `8f71cfb96260d98a8a25693c00b06bd60db2b920` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
