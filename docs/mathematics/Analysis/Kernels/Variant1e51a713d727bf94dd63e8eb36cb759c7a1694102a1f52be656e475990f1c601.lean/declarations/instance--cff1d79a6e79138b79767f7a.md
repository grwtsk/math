## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `instance` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:aa9024bd847bef1c35ddf328dc10542f9863036b649ae11d9d5d1516d0338d39`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 135–146.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
instance : Limits.HasEqualizers.{u, u + 1} SemiNormedGroupCat :=
  @hasEqualizers_of_hasLimit_parallelPair SemiNormedGroupCat _ fun {_ _ f g} =>
    SemiNormedGroupCat.hasLimit_parallelPair f g

end EqualizersAndKernels

section Cokernel

-- PROJECT: can we reuse the work to construct cokernels in `SemiNormedGroupCat₁` here?
-- I don't see a way to do this that is less work than just repeating the relevant parts.
/-- Auxiliary definition for `HasCokernels SemiNormedGroupCat`. -/
noncomputable
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Kernels/Variant1e51a713d727bf94dd63e8eb36cb759c7a1694102a1f52be656e475990f1c601.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Kernels/Variant1e51a713d727bf94dd63e8eb36cb759c7a1694102a1f52be656e475990f1c601.lean#L135).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `6298046e4f2620c99fad0c242b020241906d42b4` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
