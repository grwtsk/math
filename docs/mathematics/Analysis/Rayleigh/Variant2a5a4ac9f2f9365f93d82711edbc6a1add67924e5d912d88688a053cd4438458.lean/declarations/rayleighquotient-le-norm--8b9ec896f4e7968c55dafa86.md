## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:5c7ed0da-ce65-bf83-a9a8-91cbd3872649`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 120–124.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem rayleighQuotient_le_norm (x : E) : |T.rayleighQuotient x| ≤ ‖T‖ := by
  grw [rayleighQuotient, reApplyInnerSelf_apply, abs_div, abs_sq, abs_re_le_norm,
    norm_inner_le_norm, le_opNorm, mul_assoc, ← sq, mul_div_assoc]
  exact mul_le_of_le_one_right T.opNorm_nonneg (div_self_le_one (‖x‖ ^ 2))

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Rayleigh/Variant2a5a4ac9f2f9365f93d82711edbc6a1add67924e5d912d88688a053cd4438458.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Rayleigh/Variant2a5a4ac9f2f9365f93d82711edbc6a1add67924e5d912d88688a053cd4438458.lean#L120).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `66e8428e2794a380cd531c738c0a289a4c971bf7` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision.
