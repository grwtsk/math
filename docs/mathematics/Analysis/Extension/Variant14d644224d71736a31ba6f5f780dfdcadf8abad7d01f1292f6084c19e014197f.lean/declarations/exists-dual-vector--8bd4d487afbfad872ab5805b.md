## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:f173b4de-b74c-3a03-619d-11134001ed7c`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 164–176.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem exists_dual_vector (x : E) (h : x ≠ 0) : ∃ g : E →L[𝕜] 𝕜, ‖g‖ = 1 ∧ g x = ‖x‖ := by
  let p : Submodule 𝕜 E := 𝕜 ∙ x
  let f := (‖x‖ : 𝕜) • coord 𝕜 x h
  obtain ⟨g, hg⟩ := exists_extension_norm_eq p f
  refine ⟨g, ?_, ?_⟩
  · rw [hg.2, coord_norm']
  · calc
      g x = g (⟨x, mem_span_singleton_self x⟩ : 𝕜 ∙ x) := by rw [coe_mk]
      _ = ((‖x‖ : 𝕜) • coord 𝕜 x h) (⟨x, mem_span_singleton_self x⟩ : 𝕜 ∙ x) := by rw [← hg.1]
      _ = ‖x‖ := by simp [-algebraMap_smul]

/-- Variant of Hahn-Banach, eliminating the hypothesis that `x` be nonzero, and choosing
    the dual element arbitrarily when `x = 0`. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Extension/Variant14d644224d71736a31ba6f5f780dfdcadf8abad7d01f1292f6084c19e014197f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Extension/Variant14d644224d71736a31ba6f5f780dfdcadf8abad7d01f1292f6084c19e014197f.lean#L164).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `311621f36dc94b35e1acf4da32ec6bda07b16988` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
