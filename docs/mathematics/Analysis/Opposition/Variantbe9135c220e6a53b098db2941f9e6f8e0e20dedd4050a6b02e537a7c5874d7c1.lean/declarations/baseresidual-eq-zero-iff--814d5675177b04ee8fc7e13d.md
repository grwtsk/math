## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:ba8f0d2d-f449-e816-d2cb-56bc0ae60ce0`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 243–254.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem baseResidual_eq_zero_iff
    (opposition : OppositionStructure kernel)
    (source target : Universe.ConceptId) :
    opposition.baseResidual source target = 0 ↔
      opposition.ExactOpposition source target := by
  rw [baseResidual, norm_eq_zero, sub_eq_zero]
  rfl

/-- Coordinate antipodes are the separate relation computed by the current
finite runtime profile.  They do not inhabit `ExactOpposition` without an
additional theorem identifying coordinate negation with the role-induced
unitary. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Opposition/Variantbe9135c220e6a53b098db2941f9e6f8e0e20dedd4050a6b02e537a7c5874d7c1.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Opposition/Variantbe9135c220e6a53b098db2941f9e6f8e0e20dedd4050a6b02e537a7c5874d7c1.lean#L243).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `e40eefc2f81f7724f5707ac7ab20ca6cdc785903` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
