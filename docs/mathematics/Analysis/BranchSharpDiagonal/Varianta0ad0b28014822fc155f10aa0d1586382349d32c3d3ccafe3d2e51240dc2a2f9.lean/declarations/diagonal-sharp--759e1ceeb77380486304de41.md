## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:3ccaead6-9057-88bf-3763-4df3b8b850e5`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 233–241.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem diagonal_sharp {A t : ℝ} (hA : 1 ≤ A) (ht : t ∈ readingWindow A) :
    diagonalEnergy A t ≤ 8 * A := by
  have he : Real.exp (-t / 2) ≤ A⁻¹ := by
    rw [← exp_negative_reset (by linarith : 0 < A)]
    exact Real.exp_le_exp.mpr (by linarith [ht.1])
  have hprod := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left he (by linarith : 0 ≤ A)
  rw [mul_inv_cancel₀ (by linarith : A ≠ 0)] at hprod
  linarith [diagonal_exact_integral_bound hA ht, Real.log_nonneg hA, ht.2]

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/BranchSharpDiagonal/Varianta0ad0b28014822fc155f10aa0d1586382349d32c3d3ccafe3d2e51240dc2a2f9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/BranchSharpDiagonal/Varianta0ad0b28014822fc155f10aa0d1586382349d32c3d3ccafe3d2e51240dc2a2f9.lean#L233).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `b0e95b1dc23f1700c8892652db73d1586345d97c` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
