## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:30c884fe-4edc-703c-2aaf-bc17f15a4476`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 126–140.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem actual_closed_primitive_termwise_upper {x : ℝ} (hx : 0 ≤ x) :
    |ArithmeticPrimitive.closedPrimitive (fun n ↦ ArithmeticFunction.vonMangoldt n - 1) x| ≤
      absolutePrimitiveMass x := by
  rw [exact_closed_primitive_weight_row]
  have h := Finset.abs_sum_le_sum_abs (s := Finset.Icc 2 ⌊x⌋₊)
    (f := fun n ↦ (ArithmeticFunction.vonMangoldt n - 1) * primitiveWeight x n)
  apply h.trans_eq
  unfold absolutePrimitiveMass
  apply Finset.sum_congr rfl
  intro n hn
  obtain ⟨hn2, hnhi⟩ := Finset.mem_Icc.mp hn
  have hnx := (show (n : ℝ) ≤ (⌊x⌋₊ : ℝ) by exact_mod_cast hnhi).trans (Nat.floor_le hx)
  rw [abs_mul, abs_of_nonneg (visible_primitive_weight_nonnegative (by omega) hnx)]

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/MangoldtPrimitiveAbsoluteMass/Variant1497224deb0add0fea83d7007e5402979c1c364d37fcf5a13f01f52abe06808f.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/MangoldtPrimitiveAbsoluteMass/Variant1497224deb0add0fea83d7007e5402979c1c364d37fcf5a13f01f52abe06808f.lean#L126).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `0d9215002a8c434ab2a0174941c7b42e2b0934a3` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
