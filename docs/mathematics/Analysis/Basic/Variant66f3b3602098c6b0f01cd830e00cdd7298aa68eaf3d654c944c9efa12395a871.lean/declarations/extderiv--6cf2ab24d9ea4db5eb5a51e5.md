## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:256e5994d0859ac9eb5dabcd424c24c1868c56a7de3848d21e5301d8eb33de61`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 81–95.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
noncomputable def extDeriv (ω : E → E [⋀^Fin n]→L[𝕜] F) (x : E) : E [⋀^Fin (n + 1)]→L[𝕜] F :=
  .alternatizeUncurryFin (fderiv 𝕜 ω x)

/-- Exterior derivative of a differential form within a set.

There are a few competing definitions of the exterior derivative of a differential form
that differ from each other by a normalization factor.
We use the following one:

$$
dω(x; v_0, \dots, v_n) = \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i D_x ω(x; v_0, \dots, \widehat{v_i}, \dots, v_n) · v_i
$$

where $\widehat{v_i}$ means that we omit this element of the tuple, see `extDerivWithin_apply`.

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Basic/Variant66f3b3602098c6b0f01cd830e00cdd7298aa68eaf3d654c944c9efa12395a871.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Basic/Variant66f3b3602098c6b0f01cd830e00cdd7298aa68eaf3d654c944c9efa12395a871.lean#L81).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `7300465a16327cc540fe33a4a064c58cbc074888` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
