## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:239a73a5276e0408ebdc37e67e051786943f4147e880dc65789a71df967fb006`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 161–165.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def scopeStep (seed : Set State) (expand : Set State →o Set State) : Set State →o Set State where
  toFun X := seed ∪ X ∪ expand X
  monotone' _X _Y h := union_subset_union (union_subset_union_right seed h) (expand.monotone h)

/-- The least closed scope containing the declared seed. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/BranchDescentWitness/Variantdf74882673e25901a6c89d2ad6900ade3fa551b1eb05913d3faf2a19a65dd6b9.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/BranchDescentWitness/Variantdf74882673e25901a6c89d2ad6900ade3fa551b1eb05913d3faf2a19a65dd6b9.lean#L161).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `5ccefab6bacf618fecf4182f542b2367444656c9` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
