## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:e03c941f-c387-60eb-90b9-c079d2c9670b`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 87–93.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem norm_eq_of_zero {x : ℝ} : ‖(x : AddCircle (0 : ℝ))‖ = |x| := by
  suffices { y : ℝ | (y : AddCircle (0 : ℝ)) = (x : AddCircle (0 : ℝ)) } = {x} by
    rw [quotient_norm_eq, this, image_singleton, Real.norm_eq_abs, csInf_singleton]
  ext y
  simp [QuotientAddGroup.eq_iff_sub_mem, mem_zmultiples_iff, sub_eq_zero]
#align add_circle.norm_eq_of_zero AddCircle.norm_eq_of_zero

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/AddCircle/Variantf0676497085f415672b8dd807f29f771fc4662bec65302c645733ac2aee1162e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/AddCircle/Variantf0676497085f415672b8dd807f29f771fc4662bec65302c645733ac2aee1162e.lean#L87).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `38c2c066aa52d6d94abd4ad2a3697efb4a1dd6b2` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
