## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:7554be80-e4a4-6299-117c-ba2a78485ed4`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 110–115.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem completion.lift_unique {V W : SemiNormedGrp} [CompleteSpace W] [T0Space W]
    (f : V ⟶ W) (g : completion.obj V ⟶ W) : completion.incl ≫ g = f → g = completion.lift f :=
  fun h => SemiNormedGrp.hom_ext (NormedAddGroupHom.extension_unique _ fun v =>
    ((SemiNormedGrp.ext_iff.1 h) v).symm).symm

end SemiNormedGrp
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/Analysis/Completion/Variant373fc31dfa773efe111f0c46d64552e782cb8e4c8fbe44c4f95a28064440ab7e.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/Analysis/Completion/Variant373fc31dfa773efe111f0c46d64552e782cb8e4c8fbe44c4f95a28064440ab7e.lean#L110).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `1028c1deeffc05b465f52378695b4be076d74959` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
