## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `theorem` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `result:10abcbec-fe4d-a53d-e612-02fcffa6b8b9`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 45–57.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
theorem improvement (A B e x y : R) (n : ℕ)
    (hx : e ∣ x) (hy : e ∣ y) (hxy : e^n ∣ x-y) :
    e^(n+1) ∣ (e^2+e*x-A*x^2-B*x^3)-(e^2+e*y-A*y^2-B*y^3) := by
  obtain ⟨a,ha⟩ := hx
  obtain ⟨b,hb⟩ := hy
  obtain ⟨z,hz⟩ := hxy
  refine ⟨z*(1-A*(a+b)-B*e*(a^2+a*b+b^2)), ?_⟩
  calc
    _ = (x-y)*(e-A*(x+y)-B*(x^2+x*y+y^2)) := by ring
    _ = e^(n+1)*(z*(1-A*(a+b)-B*e*(a^2+a*b+b^2))) := by
      rw [hz,ha,hb,pow_succ]
      ring

```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_NATIVE_ADMISSION`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/WeierstrassRescaledJet.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/WeierstrassRescaledJet.lean#L45).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `2dc39c341c3bad4cbb1c7ce549f4f98fc5e3046b` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
