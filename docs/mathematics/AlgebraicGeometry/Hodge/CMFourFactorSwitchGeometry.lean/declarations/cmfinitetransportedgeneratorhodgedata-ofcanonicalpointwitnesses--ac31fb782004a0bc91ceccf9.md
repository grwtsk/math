## Abstract

This article records the exact pinned source window beginning at a lexical `def` command. Its hypotheses, conclusion and proof text remain in the source below. No mathematical summary or claim of proof acceptance is inferred.

## 1. Statement, hypotheses and proof source

Occurrence: `declaration:8fdaec5f00640c8638cf9e8e35263a7bfda43d4db87a728d429e7031fc034efb`. Observation: `LEXICAL_COMMAND_HEAD`. Source lines 3613–3626.

The window ends immediately before the next observed declaration, or at end of file. It can contain adjacent commands. The [complete source snapshot](../source.md) preserves surrounding namespace, variables, imports and notation.

```lean
def CMFiniteTransportedGeneratorHodgeData.ofCanonicalPointWitnesses
    {E : CMGaloisIntermediateField}
    {factors : CMFiniteFourEmbeddingLineVectors E}
    {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module ℚ V]
    {D : CMFiniteFourfoldAssembly factors}
    {hodgeSubspace : Submodule ℂ (ℂ ⊗[ℚ] V)}
    (W : ∀ σ : AlgebraicNumbers ≃ₐ[ℚ] AlgebraicNumbers,
      CMFiniteCanonicalPointWitness D hodgeSubspace σ) :
    CMFiniteTransportedGeneratorHodgeData D hodgeSubspace where
  generator_mem := fun σ => (W σ).generator_mem_hodge

/-- The balanced-image witness implies the pointwise witness without any
spanning theorem. This is a forgetful conversion: it does not manufacture
the actual comparison map or establish a new geometric Hodge fact. -/
```

## 2. Verification and trust boundary

**Module verification:** `BLOCKED_SOURCE_DEPENDENCY`. Native compilation: NOT_RUN; named axiom audit: NOT_RUN. This is a source-bound obligation status, not theorem acceptance.

[Verification target and public status](../../../../../verification/AlgebraicGeometry/Hodge/CMFourFactorSwitchGeometry.lean/index.md). A module build status does not by itself certify this occurrence, its transitive axioms, an intended informal statement, or a composite bridge. Source observations and anonymous commands may have no elaborated declaration identity.

**Three-degree spectral volume S₃:** unavailable (`verification_dependency_graph_unavailable`). [Ranking definition and adjustable weights](../../../../../reference/ranking-profile.json).

## 3. Composition and missing bridges

Composition, semantic subject associations, transitive axiom audit and three-degree verification dependency metrics remain unassessed unless independently bound evidence is supplied. All observed commands are retained regardless of verification status.

## 4. Sources and revision

[Pinned upstream source](https://github.com/grwtsk/math/blob/706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374/GRWTSK/AlgebraicGeometry/Hodge/CMFourFactorSwitchGeometry.lean#L3613).

Commit: `706c62c1285a9857cb9d52e0620ec2cb514eb374` · blob: `97ed0f5e967f8b6e1cbb8f20912683bf7a9817fe` · root tree: `5251a5a6d85a8d3f06b12803d6bd7887693b65a8`.

Historical occurrence identities in the metadata retain their original commit/blob pins. They do not certify a new source revision. 

Generated source issuance, revision 1. Local attribution applies to the article; source bylines and license obligations are preserved in the full source snapshot.
